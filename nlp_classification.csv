"Noting that the resignation of James Mattis as Secretary of Defense marked the ouster of the third top administration official in less than three weeks, a worried populace told reporters Friday that it was unsure how many former Trump staffers it could safely reabsorb. “Jesus, we can’t just take back these assholes all at once—we need time to process one before we get the next,” said 53-year-old Gregory Birch of Naperville, IL echoing the concerns of 323 million Americans in also noting that the country was only now truly beginning to reintegrate former national security advisor Michael Flynn. “This is just not sustainable. I’d say we can handle maybe one or two more former members of Trump’s inner circle over the remainder of the year, but that’s it. This country has its limits.” The U.S. populace confirmed that they could not handle all of these pieces of shit trying to rejoin society at once.",1
"Desperate to unwind after months of nonstop work investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election, visibly exhausted Special Counsel Robert Mueller powered his phone down Friday in order to give himself a break from any news concerning the probe over the holiday break. “The last thing I want when I’m spending time with my family is a cascade of push notifications telling me yet another Russian oligarch, political operative, or highly placed socialite used Deutsche Bank channels to funnel money to the campaign,” said the former FBI director, firmly holding down his phone’s power button and adding that he wants to be “completely present in the moment” while celebrating with his loved ones, not ruminating about who met with which diplomat or whether someone was using social media to tamper with his witnesses. “I just want to have two calm weeks where I don’t even think about Individual One. I won’t even say his name. I’ll have to wait to hear about any important developments in January, since I just know the second I read, say, something about Eric being involved more deeply than we previously suspected, I’ll get pulled back in and ruin my whole vacation.” At press time, Mueller had reactivated his phone just to check the news real quick.

"Attempting to make amends for gross abuses of power during his time as Interior Department Secretary, an unusually contrite Ryan Zinke apologized Monday for misusing government funds by sending the members of the ethics committee a $160,000 vase. “I know this doesn’t change anything about how I exploited my cabinet position, but I hope you will accept this beautiful example of Qing dynasty porcelain as a small token of my regret,” said Zinke, acknowledging that while no gift could make up for the time he spent $139,000 of taxpayer money to renovate his office doors, he hoped the committee would consider the vase as a sincere gesture of apology. “I was wrong to take advantage of my position, and I hope the lustrous glazing and firing evident in this piece will move you to forgive me for my all-too-human failings. Please don’t remember me as the man who used government funds on security detail for my family while we were on vacation in Turkey, or as the man who violated the Hatch Act and acted as a pawn for the oil and gas industry. Rather, when your eyes happen to fall on this unique example of kaolin clay-work, I hope you will remember me as the man who bought each of you the 2019 Mercedes Benz S560 sedans you’ll find in the parking lot when you leave today.” Zinke further plans to apologize in person to each committee member by visiting them at their homes using a government helicopter.",1
"Decrying the Senate’s resolution blaming the crown prince for the brutal torture and murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as “a cruel, inhumane, and unprecedented interference into a sovereign kingdom’s internal affairs,” the Trump administration launched a human rights investigation Monday into the Senate’s harsh treatment of Saudi ruler Mohammad bin Salman. “We are looking into the deeply troubling accusations that the United States Senate has chosen to willfully and knowingly place fault for the murder of a dissident journalist on a Saudi crown prince,” said the president, claiming that no despot should be made to endure such inhumane treatment as the loss of military funding for an ongoing war in Yemen that has left millions homeless and starving, no matter whose dismemberment they may have ordered. “Facing criticism like this on the international stage is, for a powerful leader such as bin Salman, basically torture, and we take this kind of mistreatment very seriously. This is not how Americans treat authoritarian regimes that purchase our weapons. Without billions of dollars in military aid, how is the Saudi regime supposed to maintain its basic standard of living?” The Trump administration is expected to charge all American senators with crimes against humanity for their role in holding the Saudi regime responsible for its actions.",1
"Following sentencing for his role in a hush-money scandal, Michael Cohen was granted a prison work release for a new job with the Trump 2020 campaign, sources confirmed Wednesday. “We’re confident that engaging in honest work will help Mr. Cohen with his rehabilitation,” said warden Pete Clements, telling reporters that having an opportunity to give back to society by serving as an advisor for the 2020 Trump presidential campaign would help Cohen see the error of his past behaviors. “Once he arrives in March, Mr. Cohen will be bused from our penitentiary to Trump’s Manhattan campaign office for an eight-hour work day before returning to prison each night. Mr. Cohen will be under strict supervision during these furloughs, which will allow him to use his skills for the betterment of the community and give him a chance to reintegrate into society.” Clements added that Cohen’s request for a position as the RNC’s 2020 deputy finance chairman had been denied over concerns that the work environment would make it too easy to backslide into criminality.

"Grimacing and clutching at his shoulder, Fox NFL announcer Joe Buck tore his rotator cuff after an awkward throw down to the sideline during the second quarter of the Buccaneers vs. Cowboys game. “You hate to see an announcer go down like that. Especially on such a routine throw down to Erin to check the field conditions. He’s made that throw a thousand times,” said commentator Troy Aikman, adding that Buck went down hard after stumbling over the first few words of the sentence and was still on the ground writhing in pain after the update was over. “You could see something was wrong the second the words left his mouth, it just didn’t look right. He twisted awkwardly as he said ‘on the sideline’ and then this shock of pain crossed his face. This isn’t as bad as when I saw Al Michaels tear his ACL on a touchdown call, but there is no way Joe is going to be announcing for at least a month.” At press time, Aikman was being treated for a concussion after attempting to analyze the play call on a third-down conversion.",1
"Categorically denying allegations that the tactic was unconstitutional and unfairly targeted players who protested the national anthem, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement Sunday defending the NFL’s right to subject Panthers safety Eric Reid to random stop-and-frisk searches. “We’re simply trying to keep the game clean and provide a safe environment that benefits all our players. In this case, we received an anonymous tip about a suspicious-looking individual with a mask obscuring his face acting aggressively towards our players and decided to inform the proper authorities,” said Goodell at a press conference in which he advised Reid against loitering at the line of scrimmage or other sensitive areas to avoid similar incidents moving forward. “He was described holding an unidentified object in his hands, a description which prompted officials to detain Mr Reid and perform a thorough strip-search. We were all relieved to discover it was just a football, this time, but no single player is above the code of conduct.” Reid and 11 of his teammates are currently being held for questioning on suspicion of gang-related activity after eyewitnesses observed them wearing clothes bearing the same colors and threatening logo.",1
"Quashing rumors that the team was looking to make an early exit for Las Vegas, the Oakland Raiders announced plans Wednesday to play the entirety of their 2019 home schedule in Head Coach Jon Gruden’s backyard. “This is really the perfect venue for this this team—in fact, I think playing in my yard will provide a unique home field advantage like nowhere else in the league,” said Gruden, adding that the proposed half-acre plot nestled in the Bay Area suburbs boasted a beautiful natural surface and enough improvised seating to accommodate dozens of hardcore Raiders faithful. “Make no mistake, this place is going to be rocking. I mean, I can’t wait to see Derek Carr out there delivering touchdown strikes from way up there on the deck. Plus, fans are just going to love the new amenities. We’ve made some room for the the Black Hole over there by the garbage cans. We’ve got 3.5 bathrooms and a crockpot full of chili in the house. Seriously, I don’t think there’s a better way to spend a Sunday.” At press time, several Raiders players admitted that despite the treacherous clothesline and exposed tree roots, playing in Coach Gruden’s backyard was still far preferable to games on a “goddamn baseball field.”",1
"Claiming it was the most humane way to deal with their suffering fans, the Cleveland Browns announced Tuesday that they had euthanized the entirety of the Dawg Pound following a rabies outbreak. “They were a part of our Browns family, and we’re heartbroken over cutting their lives short, but putting them down was the only option,” said team owner Jimmy Haslam, who revealed the Browns’ concern was piqued after several members of the Dawg Pound began chewing on plastic seats and salivating uncontrollably, but that by the time the outbreak was discovered it was too late for any cure to be administered. “We have to put the safety of our fans first. The Dawg Pound may have still seemed fun and approachable, but many were getting aggressive, and it was only a matter of time before they bit someone. It may seem cruel, but their quality of life was never going to be the same—they were battling constant seizures, and the hydrophobia resulting from the rabies was making it impossible for them to drink beer.” Haslam, who emphasized the sadness of the mercy killing, assured fans that they could take comfort in knowing the Dawg Pound would never have to suffer through another Browns’ game again.",1
"In recognition of the brave and altruistic Americans who risk their health and safety for the greater good, Pentagon officials announced Thursday that the U.S. military would honor the sacrifices of NFL players by wearing their jerseys throughout December. “Every week, these men are out there on the gridiron, putting their bodies on the line for our country. Having our soldiers wear these jerseys and caps is the least we can do to show our support,” said Pentagon spokesperson Robert D’Amato, who announced that all active-duty soldiers would be sporting gear from all 32 teams to raise awareness of the people who put their lives aside to preserve the American way of life. “These men leave their homes and their families and travel to cities across the country to uphold our nation’s traditions. They are battered and bruised for years, their lives often cut short while we sit back in our barracks and enjoy our freedom. Some of them are never the same after they end their service, and yet we take them for granted. Hopefully, this small gesture shows that the soldiers and officers of the U.S. military know who the true heroes really are.”",1
"Welling up with emotion upon finally setting foot on the hallowed tile surface, college senior Anthony Harper fulfilled his lifelong dream Saturday after finally being allowed to shower with the Notre Dame football team. “A lot of people told me I would never make it into these showers, but I knew that if I worked hard and never quit, I have what it takes to strip down and lather up with Notre Dame football,” said Harper, who received an ovation from the team after coach Brian Kelly tossed him some conditioner and told him to “get on in there.” “Every week for the last three years, I would sit on the bench in this locker room and watch the team shower, wishing I could be in there with them. I always thought I was too small to soap up with Notre Dame, but it just goes to show that with enough grit and determination, anyone can achieve their lifelong dream to bathe with a college football team.” Harper added that finally getting to shower with Notre Dame was made even more special by having his entire family there to witness it.",1
"In an announcement perceived as a major reassurance to parents of children with low cognitive abilities, subpar reasoning skills, or who are simply “not all there,” top national pediatric health experts released a report Monday which claims that full-contact football poses little risk to children whose brains already don’t work too well. “Tackle football has long been known to be a high-risk sport, particularly for children under 12, but face it—some of these poor little guys are real knuckle-draggers, so why take away their fun? I mean, what do they have to lose?” said University of Chicago childhood development expert Dr. Maureen Clifford, whose neuropathological research led her to the conclusion that the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by repeated or severe head impacts in children is mitigated by more than 90 percent in cases where the youth presented signs of being a huge dumbass and clearly had a couple screws loose already. “Of course, CTE is the most significant danger when it comes to contact sports like football, and the ages 10 to 18 are especially crucial to healthy neurological growth. But what are the symptoms of CTE? Mood swings, difficult thinking, memory loss? If that sounds like your kid, it’s because your precious little dude is already kind of a bonehead. Blocking, tackling, and getting hit on crossing routes are the least of the reasons why they’re acting like such a goddamn idiot all the time.” The study concluded that, for many of these halfwits, football is in fact their only shot at success.",1
"Staring wide-eyed at the table full of unopened presents being largely ignored by guests, local man Rick Joseph reportedly watched helplessly Friday as the White Elephant exchange completely devolved into friends just chatting and having a nice time. “Christ, it should have been my turn to pick a gift over an hour ago, but we keep getting derailed by everyone blabbing on and on about what they’re doing for fucking Christmas,” said Joseph, who was forced to listen to friends engaged in pleasant conversations about family traditions, favorite holiday recipes, and beloved childhood memories of the festive season. “Ugh, this is a goddamn disaster. These chumps should be strategizing about which person they’re going to screw over to get the best present, but instead they’re wasting this time trying to bond. No one is even fighting. This is the last time I invite people over for a holiday party.” Joseph confirmed that the evening turned into an utter nightmare after his friends began singing their favorite Christmas carols.",1
"Detailing the extensive backstories of the wall hangings and how he came to acquire them, local man Richard Minhas was methodically explaining Thursday the origin of every poster hanging in his apartment. “This one over here is a print of a Japanese woodblock I got from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and then the one right next to it is a vintage Tylenol advertisement I picked up at a garage sale,” said Minhas, ushering his guest around the 750-square-foot space, stopping by the placards, which included an old-timey map of Arizona and a reproduction of a 1977 Fleetwood Mac tour poster, to elucidate their content as well as his personal connection to the pieces. “I really like this French movie The Wages Of Fear, so I placed it next to this other poster for Bicycle Thieves, since they’re both movies. As for these ones in the kitchen, this is a taxonomic chart cataloguing a bunch of varieties of mushrooms, this one is the same thing but with spices, this one is a diagram of a cow showing all the cuts of beef, and then this is an old sign advertising fresh tomatoes I got at a farmers market.” After he finished explaining all the posters, Minhas reportedly expounded on every keepsake on his bookshelf.

"Sighing in exasperation and repeatedly checking the clock as he completed a number of menial tasks, area man Alan Stover confirmed Wednesday he had spent a long day at work waiting until he could finally go home and be lonely. “It’s so annoying having to be here in the office doing all this tedious paperwork when I could be sitting there all alone in my empty apartment,” said Stover, telling reporters he was “counting down the minutes” until he could at long last go home, stretch out on the sofa, and just feel hollow inside for the rest of the evening. “By the time I get out of the afternoon meeting and finish all these spreadsheets, I’ll be lucky if I can still putter around my apartment, eat leftover takeout in front of the microwave, vacantly scroll through Netflix, blearily mutter ‘time for bed’ to myself, and fall asleep before I have to start the whole thing over again tomorrow. God, it feels like five o’clock will never come.” At press time, Stover was reportedly frustrated after his evening plans were ruined by a text inviting him to a bar for a friend’s birthday.",1
"Saying that he had “a really good feeling about today,” excited firefighter Pat Morales, 37, took the first opportunity he had on his Wednesday shift to check his fire station’s drop-off bin for any unwanted babies that may have come in while the crew was away. “Every time I come to work, I try to be the first one to the bin to check for babies—it’s really the best part of my day,” a grinning Morales told reporters as he gleefully unlocked the climate-controlled box outside of Saint Paul Fire Station 19 and felt around the padded interior, being careful to check to see if any infants were clogging the chute or had perhaps become stuck in the slot. “It just makes you feel special when you come back from a hard day of fighting fires and there’s a fresh baby warming up in the drop box. Even if we’ve only been out for an hour, I always check the bin when we get back. You never know!” According to his coworkers, Morales is always the first to volunteer every year to decorate the newly donated babies for the holidays.",1
"Declaring his willingness to put the whole phase of his life behind him once and for all, 28-year-old man Neil Donovan confirmed Tuesday that he had finally found it in himself to forgive himself for a terrible mistake he made two seconds ago. “This has been an albatross around my neck for what sometimes seems like several seconds, but I think it’s time that I finally accept myself for what I’ve grown into and move on,” said Donovan, adding that he was looking forward to starting his life’s next chapter unencumbered by the relentless guilt and self-loathing that consumed every waking moment of his past two seconds. “Honestly, letting go lifted a huge weight from my shoulders. It took real soul searching, painful admissions about who I really was back then, and, ultimately, personal growth and maturation for me to realize that I can’t keep living in my immediate past. Eventually, I was granted a fresh perspective, and I came to accept that there will be a time, perhaps 10 seconds from now, when I won’t even remember that any of this happened.” Donovan also admitted he still does not understand how his wife could bear the emotional strain of living with grudges stemming from something he did over 14 seconds ago.",1
"Admitting that he thought he would have moved on by now, 28-year-old marketing analyst Garrett Moore reportedly grew wistful and teary-eyed Monday while revealing that everything still reminded him of Her. “Even the breeze in the park reminds of the cool rush of air conditioning I felt in the theater that night when I first saw Her,” said Moore, adding that everything from the smell of buttered popcorn to the sweet taste of raspberry iced tea brought back torrents of vivid memories that could always be traced back to Her. “When I close my eyes, I can picture Her so clearly. Any time I hear that Kim Deal song “Are You Mine?” I recall those few fleeting hours we spent together in the summer of 2013. I’ve rarely seen Her since I left the theater that night. About a year ago, I saw Her across the room at a party, but didn’t have the courage to approach. Maybe it’s for the best. Either way, I’ll always cherish what we had back then.” At press time, Moore confirmed that the $13.29 he paid for that magical night with Her was the best money he’d ever spent.",1
"Struggling to explain her positive emotional state, area woman Erin Kinney reportedly spent Monday wondering why she was suddenly happy despite not having purchased anything recently. “Huh, that’s weird. Why do I feel so content right now? I don’t think I splurged on anything today, but maybe I just forgot,” said Kinney, who then proceeded to scroll back through her Amazon order history to double check if she had purchased anything that had momentarily slipped her mind. “I swear I must have bought, like, a new sweater, a fancy candle, or some expensive Korean face masks to make myself this cheerful and energized, but I looked at my credit card statement and I apparently I didn’t buy a single thing—not even groceries. Did I go to Target recently? I don’t have any memory of going shopping, but why else would I feel so good?” At press time, Kinney told reporters that she had become so flustered by the whole situation that she had no choice but to run out to a local drug store and buy herself a little pick-me-up.",1
"Calling the product the must-have item for true music connoisseurs, Bose officials announced Friday the release of the new W85 headphones that are specifically optimized for listening to Whitney Houston’s “How Will I Know.” “We’re proud to introduce the W85 as the next generation in Whitney optimization,” said spokesperson Kathleen Campbell, touting the new headphones’ variety of customized features designed to enhance listener experience of the highs, lows, and key changes of the 1985 chart-topping hit. “With these new headphones, listeners can be sure they’re receiving the premiere ‘How Will I Know’ experience, from the song’s opening beats all the way to its iconic tenor saxophone solo—not to mention the smooth, powerful voice of Houston herself. The upbeat anthem of young love even comes preloaded onto the headphones on a six-hour loop, so there’s nothing to plug in or download. You’ll never listen to ‘How Will I Know’ the same way again.” Bose also teased the upcoming release of a new $4,000 home entertainment system optimized for “How Will I Know.”",1
"Fresh off her victory in last night’s finale of The Voice, 16-year-old country singer Chevel Shepherd told reporters Wednesday she was excited to use the $50 Chili’s gift card she received for winning the televised singing competition. “After all those months of hard work, to win 50 bucks to spend on anything I want at Chili’s—it’s truly a dream come true!” said Shepherd, revealing that she planned to select items from the casual dining chain’s three-for-$10 menu in order to make the most of her winnings. “There were definitely moments during the competition when I didn’t know if I truly had what it takes to win. But my coach, Kelly [Clarkson], just encouraged me to visualize myself walking off the stage with that gift card in my hand, and that’s what kept me going. I’ll definitely be treating her to some Southwestern egg rolls or Cajun chicken pasta! I am very blessed.” Shepherd added that she was proud of the other three finalists, who each received a coupon for half-off any entrée from Chili’s, and suggested maybe they could all go out to celebrate together sometime.",1
"Saying the news would come as a big disappointment to her, former CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves confided to reporters Tuesday that he was uncertain how to tell his wife Julie Chen he didn’t get the $120 million bonus he had been expecting from the company. “She’s going to be so upset with me when she finds out,” said Moonves, adding that he could put off breaking it to Chen for a little while, but that eventually she would wonder what had happened to the nine-figure sum he had promised her he would be receiving upon his exit from CBS. “Julie was so excited when I told her about the big bonus I’d be getting this year. She even left her job at The Talk because I made it sound like a sure thing. Gosh, what if she’s already spent some of it?” At press time, Moonves was reportedly worried that his wife had begun to suspect something was up after he canceled the big vacation they’d been looking forward to.",1
"Pushing back against what they view as political correctness run amok, DJs at local radio station 104.5 “The Cat” were defiantly playing “The Little Drummer Boy” on repeat Tuesday despite claims that the Christmas standard contains sexually predatory themes. “This is a classic song, and the manufactured outrage surrounding it won’t frighten us into taking it off the air,” said Director of Programming Darren Boccia, telling reporters that he rejected the modern interpretation of a hidden, coercive meaning behind lyrics like “Come they told me” and “Pa rum pum pum pum.” “I grew up singing this song, my kids grew up singing it, and we’re not going to stop playing it because a few people with dirty minds have constructed some perverse narrative about the ox and ram keeping time that no one was thinking about when the song was written in the 1940s. We’ll be playing ‘The Little Drummer Boy’ 24/7 until Christmas, and if people don’t like it, they can switch to a different station.” Boccia added that the station would continue its years-long practice of refusing to play “Silver Bells” due to the song being an obvious affront to Christ.",1
"Expressing regret after being misled by the ruthless stunt, the Rock & Rock Hall of Fame rescinded the nomination they offered to The Cure Thursday after discovering the band was voted in as a cruel prank by popular kids. “We will no longer be inducting The Cure to the Hall after learning they were selected to join our 2019 class by a group of jocks and preps who wanted to mess with the shy band,” said the organization’s president Greg Harris, as the goth rock group’s initial excitement quickly turned to despair after learning of the mischievous trick, causing the sensitive members to cry so hard their makeup streaked down their faces. “While we appreciate The Cure’s musical contributions, the band will not be taking part in our annual ceremony. We feel for the group—they thought they were finally being accepted, but it turns out the cool kids just wanted to embarrass them.” At press time, the organization had inducted the Dave Matthews Band instead.",1

"O socialism America Oprah Obama O'Rourke Ocasio Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Beto O‘Rourke, Ocasio-Cortez, these are all darlings of the socialist democrat party in America who all have something in common, the letter ‘o’. What is it about the letter ‘o’ that is so endearing to the socialists and their dream of turning America into a pseudo-communist socialist state resembling Venezuela? We asked Democrat party official Oona Menendez, the same question. “Why is the letter ‘o’ so important for Democrat politicians, especially regarding elections?” She replied quite succinctly: “Candidates have a greater success with the letter ‘o’ in their name because it breeds familiarity. Like with an ‘o’ people immediately know they’re safe, they are guaranteed socialism or communism. We adopted the significance of ‘o’ after eight years of Barack Obama rule. He was the first big ‘o’ which denoted ‘change’ and he brought in much socialist and Marxist changes to America, which is sadly being eroded by the current president. ‘O’ also stands for the circle, inclusivity, globalism, and collectivism. The main reason though, as I mentioned before, is familiarity, because when a voter is about to tick the box on election day, all they have to look for is where the Os are. If you see an ‘o’ on the first or last name, that’s who you vote for — Democrat. It’s really as simple as that.” We asked her where ‘Hillary’ fits into this? “She doesn’t. Never has, never will.” ",1

"Amedeo Modigliani (1884–1920) The ever present insanity of Big Brother Google and its puritanical push to meddle with every step the Daily Squib takes is taking a toll on our patience. Showcasing a masterpiece from renowned painter Modigliani is now deemed as sexual perversion by internet monopoly Google who threatened to disable our ads on the front page. This sort of puritanical nonsense is possibly just another way of punishing the Squib on a constant basis but what is for certain, it is highly illogical and goes against any artistic sensibilities or reason. The Modigliani nudes are world famous and displayed in art galleries worldwide, having said that, it is inconsistent with normal human behaviour to ban a nude painting of a woman because it is an artistic representation of the female form created by an artist. It boggles the mind the amount of censorship that is being doled out on a constant basis on our site, and we can only suppose we are being specifically targeted by Google to thwart every operation we do. We cannot joke, we cannot display art, we cannot write satire, we cannot do anything anymore without being censored by the humourless, anti-art, anti-satire, anti-creativity company called Google. This injustice, is of course not deemed as important by others, and the double standards reek of a witch hunt against satire sites like ours who have a different opinion, and dare to speak freely. Whilst Google allows other sites to display scenes of torture, violence, paedophilia and perverted sexual content, we simply displayed a painting of a Modigliani nude painting and were summarily punished. There is a nefarious air about the level of censorship, that is certainly even more pervasive than was witnessed under Soviet Russia’s era of discontent or any dystopian nightmare scenario dreamed up by George Orwell. As for Modigliani, what would he have said if his nudes were deemed as offensive. Naturally he would have spat in the face of his accusers, and called them a few well chosen names, before leaving in pure disgust. Nu couché (We have not posted a picture of the painting because it is deemed sexually offensive by Google but it can be viewed on the Wikipedia link above) Known in English as Red Nude or Reclining Nude is a 1917 oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani. It is one of his most widely reproduced and exhibited paintings. The painting was sold for a cool $170,405,000 at a Christie’s New York sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive paintings ever sold. The purchaser was the Chinese businessman Liu Yiqian. The painting is one of a famous series of nudes that Modigliani painted in 1917 under the patronage of his Polish dealer Léopold Zborowski. It is believed to have been included in Modigliani’s first and only art show in 1917, at the Galerie Berthe Weill. Christie’s lot notes for their November 2015 sale of the painting observed that this group of nudes by Modigliani served to reaffirm and reinvigorate the nude as a subject of modernist art. All we can say in pure disgust is one day we hope the ghost of Modigliani haunts you Google, and the robotic soulless pieces of detritus you have working for you censoring art and the Daily Squib.",1
"If you think another year after the previous year is going to make any difference to the world and your life, stop kidding yourself. We all still live in a surveillance society where every part of our lives and info is dissected, analysed and stored in databases, we still live in a world where idiots run amuck in a state of perpetual outrage demanding less freedom and more censorship, we still live in a world where people believe in supernatural beings that can rise from the dead, walk on water, and turn water into wine. C’mon it’s just another fucking year. You have just passed another year, and now have less time to live on earth, and what an earth this has become, an overcrowded cesspool filled with garbage in the seas, plastic everywhere and pollution reaching every part of the once pure soil, now just a concrete mess clouded by fumes, cow farts, and mountains of human waste. It will certainly be another year in politics, and the lies will continue, as nothing changes, or will ever change. They only give you a few choices for a reason in an election, because both sides are merely different parts of the same coin. The controllers always own both sides, and the reason for ‘elections’ in a ‘democratic’ society is to present a few well-selected fresh faces, otherwise people get tired and riot. The elites in 2019 will most probably be quivering in their boots, and if it gets too bad, they will simply exit to New Zealand or wherever else they have prepared. One major weakness the elites always encounter is numbers — there are more of the Untermensch than them. The stock market, a place where there will be much terror will naturally keep on falling in 2019. Possibly a 40-60% correction is planned, and if you are holding stocks now, you are sadly a fool with no sense whatsoever. In fact, you deserve every bit of what you get because you did not take your money out earlier at the artificially pumped top. We also have Ebola to look forward to in 2019 as it increases its hold on Africa, much to the chagrin of the West, who keep their open borders systems in place, there is no doubt this horrid virus will spread soon enough. Trump, is now looking to lose in 2020. The purge of supporting Trump voices on all social media sites has been so effective that now there is only one voice — the socialist echo chamber. We will have more authoritarianism, we will have more outrage from the permanently outraged, we will have more censorship and the internet will be cleansed of life, of its soul, and in its place the control freak tech puritans will command over your every thought, they will dictate your every move, and they will tell you how to think and act…and if you don’t obey? Then they delete you from everything. Trump himself has been a huge disappointment. Here is a guy who had big plans. He said he would go after the internet censors and he never did. He said he would limit the all encompassing power of the tech monopolies but he never did. He said he would build a wall but never did, he said he would do so many things but he did not. He said he would dump Obamacare, but never did. Trump is now a man running scared, he is a man who has obviously tried to do some things but has been thwarted at every point by the crazed socialists employing guerilla tactics to get what they want. What about Brexit? How will 2019 be for Britain’s supposed exit from the EU..pfffft? More of the same..No Brexit, no hope of Brexit and no one willing to stand up for democracy and the EU Referendum Leave voters. Because May is bolstered by the elite, she is nigh on impossible to get rid of. The May-bot’s batteries will continue on serving her masters, until she completes her job, they then will take the batteries out themselves — no one else can. All in all, 2019 will be another year where those in charge control every facet of our lives. Another miserable year of non-freedom and slavery ahead then. To all our readers..Happy New Year. ",1
"Theresa May. It’s as simple as that. She and her coterie of Remainers have effectively condemned the Conservative party to thirty or forty years in the political wilderness away from government. It’s safe to say that every day the current PM is in her post is another nail in the coffin for the Tories at the next General Election. It does not matter if she resigns just before the election as she has promised to do, because she will have already committed the necessary damage. Theresa May has vowed to stay on until her BRINO is pushed through parliament. This act will be the defining moment when the Tories will be abandoned. Already, the Americans have stated that May’s deal means no massive trade deals with the US, thus leaving the UK with nothing. Already, Lord Haw Haw Hammond is again trying to thwart a Clean Brexit by withholding special funds for a No Deal Brexit. Something must be done right now. The UK needs a positive Brexit leader to emphasise the tenets of economic and political freedom away from the EU’s restrictive diktats and authoritarian laws. This is the only way the Conservative party can win back their electorate, otherwise they will suffer for a decades in the political wilderness. ",1
"It is quite rare to see a video that is as divisive and ridiculous as the one above. The footage shows the ultimate division America is suffering at the moment. Civil War is Assured On the one side are the Anti-American Communists, and the other are the Nationalist Capitalists, the Democrat Socialists Vs the Conservatives/Libertarians, the SoyBoys Vs the Testosterone, ultimately however it will all be settled by the people who own guns and are trained in using them. “When it kicks off, the SoyBoys will be first to die. The ANTIFA will not survive either, anti-gun democrats will perish, because they just can’t shoot straight even if they did have a gun. The Conservative American Patriot credo is shoot straight, finish the job, then move on to the next target. “Our divided nation now is hanging by a string. All it will take to trigger the Civil War, will be another economic downturn. Most people are living paycheck to paycheck, give ’em three days without and they will turn to animals to survive. The weakest in the link are the socialists, the safespace soyboys, the communist Antifa, the welfare people, basically democrat voters who have now turned so far left, they believe communism is the only answer. These people will be sitting targets because they’re anti gun and anti-American. It’ll be like shooting ducks in a barrel.” In no uncertain terms, the tragedy of America may only be solved through a final civil war to purge the nation. There are many who are wishing on a civil war so badly, they prepare everyday and will have the biggest smile on their faces when it starts. “It’ll be like Christmas, and all the holidays rolled into one. Imagine my pleasure as I pick off the commie liberal triggered fagg*ts off one by one. There will be no campus safespace for these people to run to, there will be no chant they can say to stop the bullets entering their soft bodies. At their last moment, they will wish they learned how to defend themselves, but it will be too late,” one Libertarian Militia member revealed. As for the technorati, what will happen to them in a civil war? The Silicon Valley CEOs and higher ups will flee the country in their jets leaving their underling employees to get slaughtered. There’s little or nothing an algorithm can do whilst an armed well trained right winger points a modded Ar-50 at your cranium. BANG! Expensive brains splattered all over the wall. It is quite ironic that the easily triggered left will be dispatched so easily by triggers in the guns they hate so much. ",1
"From the ashes of failure, from the tawdry miserable dawdling of a loser, from the constant bad news and capitulation rises a star who will pick Britain up, lift its head above the clouds and cement a definitive way forward leaving the pathetic miserable Remoaners and quisling weasels behind. There can be only one to take us through the mire, through the deceit and lies of Remainers and the EU — Boris Johnson. It is our firm belief that he will step up to the podium in 2019 and take the reins from Theresa May, possibly the worst prime minister Britain has ever had the misfortune to encounter. This woman, stupid or not, has grovelled at the feet of the EU making a mockery of Britain’s divine right to self rule. She has tried to sell us lies over lies, whilst proclaiming she is not lying, and she has been insistent in pushing forth her awful BRINO deal that not even Labour accept. She must resign. In 2019, if the Conservative party want to ever be voted into government ever again, they must dump Theresa May, vi et armis, it must be done, otherwise the neverending impasse will go on for years and years. The yellow vests of Britain will make sure of their discontent if this feckless EU dingleberry, May, stays as PM. Boris Johnson has already proved himself with two successive terms as London mayor, and during that period, the capital flourished, not only economically but with low crime rates as well as celebrating the cultural richness of the city. He must seize the moment mutatis mutandis, and relinquish the crone of her deathly hold which is killing the Conservative party from within. To keep Theresa May as PM, is a certain path for disaster, not only for the country, but her party, as well as the Brexit voted by 52% to Leave on June 23, 2016. There should thus be no ifs or buts — only certainty, and Boris Johnson would give this country a vast boost into the fortuitous opportunities that a real Clean Brexit or a proper deal would deliver to Britain. Ad vitam paramus. Now is the time. ",1

"Matthew 1:18-25 (the deeds of the Christian God) 18 Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. 19 Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. 20 But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 22 All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 23 “Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,” which means, “God is with us.” 24 When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, 25 but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus. Biblical experts have been studying the facts about the virgin birth of Jesus, from different ancient texts, and have come to the conclusion that Mary was sexually raped by the Holy Ghost i.e. God. “The poor girl was still a virgin and she had no capacity to refuse the seed of God entering her vagina and womb. God had sexual intercourse with Mary one night and she felt violated by a being who did not care for her feelings but did the dirty deed anyway. Selfish God had sex with Mary because he thought she was attractive and he had the power to rape her. “Within the generation we live in today, the #MeToo generation, God would be called a rapist for taking that poor girl and having sex with her without her consent. “It was not only poor Mary who was hard done by, but think of Joseph, he had not yet slept with his childhood sweetheart, when he was cucked at the post by God. Luckily, Joseph took the whole sordid episode in his stride and went along with the violated Mary and her baby Jesus,” Episcopal Dean of St Albrights Christian Research Institute, Jonathan Rembrandt, revealed in a recent study. The Angel of the Lord who appeared after the rape, was possibly a demon looking to have some fun with Mary according to theologians. “The demon who appeared to Mary looked like an angel, but was actually a demon, one of God’s emissaries who tried to justify the rape by saying it was okay to be violated by God’s pulsating phallus. Our scriptures reveal that God has a large member that shoots out Holy Sperm into his fancies, and when he ejaculates the Spirit and the Holy Ghost shoot out with such force that the Holy semen lights up in the darkness, sparkling like a thousand fireworks. What Mary would have felt as she was impregnated without her consent was possibly great confusion, coupled with pain as she was pierced violently by the Holy spear of God. Thrusting, and thrusting until the great Holy climax.” The story of the nativity that has been taught for many years is thus one of sordid rape by an almighty entity that had its way with a little virgin girl, abused her body to sow a supposed Son of God who could perform crazy miracles like walk on water and turn water into wine. “Rape should not be tolerated even if it is God who is committing it. This is a sign of the patriarchal society trying to make sexual assault okay because a God committed it. No, we say it is wrong that God raped a poor little virgin girl and then left without even saying a word to her. Does anyone think how alone and cold she must have felt, to be raped and abandoned in such a way?” #MeToo activist, Hilda Goldsberg, told a group of activists in a new YouTube video. The outrage at Mary’s rape by God is now spreading across the social media sites, with the hashtags #GodRapedMary #MeTooMary #GodRapes. Divine Intervention? The Christian church has been party to much rape in its history, however many Archbishops, and the Catholic Pope deny that God raped Mary. “Yes, he had sexual intercourse with Mary without her permission, but it was for a very good reason. Without impregnating Mary, Jesus would never have existed, even though there is no factual proof he did exist. That is not rape, but divine Godly intervention and fairy tales told to the blindly believing masses over thousands of years. It is the same Christian theory used when a Catholic priest rapes a 9-year-old boy, in the name of God,” the Pope said replying to the voices of outrage spreading across the internet. One Twitter person replied: “So it’s okay to rape a woman if you are a God and want to bring your dumbass son into this earth? Did Mary have a say in this? Her body was violated by the Holy Ghost’s jism in her pussy. Can you even think for a second how sick that is?” The mass debate goes on.",1
"Throughout history, defeating nations/civilisations depended on undermining men and masculinity. Conquering nations requires a multi-tiered approach and targeting the society of any given nation divides its infrastructure and traditions. No doubt, the West celebrates its openness and progressive liberal tenets by pushing the trans queer paedophilia agenda onto their children, however by shifting society to the extreme homosexual angle, they are weakening society militarily. This is why Russia and China are utilising the Western feminist movement as well as the transexual/homosexual push to defeat the West from the inside. Masculinity is now seen as toxic in the West. Men are targeted daily by anti-male media stories, advertisements, and education in schools. By targeting children to question their given gender/sexuality, and encouraging socialist leaning parents to push their children to change their gender, especially from male to female, is an effective method of ‘cutting the balls off’ Western society. Agencies are weaponising socialist celebrations of the LGBT community to weaken the West from the inside. When war comes, there will only be a few real men to fight, the rest will not be compatible or able soldiers, this is the ultimate victory for the West’s opponents. Clandestine operations experts working for Russia are the ones who are encouraging the #MeToo movement, because it destabilises Western society through the breakdown of family units. They encourage feminism and fund feminist activists through the backdoor because to not have a strong masculine West means it is weak and ripe for conquest. These operatives work through many subsidiaries to encourage the Western male to think he is a woman, do the right thing, chop off your meat and two veg at a gender clinic and grow some hormone breasts. “They are disarming the West, seeding disharmony, confusion, and leaving Western men emasculated, castrated by feminism and socialist activists funded directly by the Kremlin and Chinese espionage experts. S-r-s is key to much of the operational activities but is untouchable,” a source revealed. Before any attack, one must prepare, these are the tenets of Sun Tzu, and this is what Russia/China are doing — preparing. Weakening the West by eradicating real men, if there are only weak emasculated men left, once the final push comes through, there will be little or no resistance. Other ways that China particularly is working on to weaken the West is through importation of drugs like Fentanyl, an opiate 50-100 times stronger than heroin, that is decimating whole communities in the United States. The vast pharmaceutical factories in China are working day and night churning out cheap highly addictive drugs to be shipped to America, for a very good reason, disarming the nation from within. The West is being set up, and nobody but a few can see it. The Russians and Chinese want your son emasculated, they want your son to want to think he is a woman and have his balls chopped off, they want your son to be encouraged at nursery school to be taught in homosexuality by socialist teachers under a poster of a smiling Obama. The Western media now is geared completely to denigrating men, to weaken masculinity and to encourage male children to be gender reassigned. Through socialism, Russia and China are working to defeat the West to such a point that in the future, they may just march in and be accepted without a single bullet being fired. When one looks at the societies of Russia and China, there is only strength. Homosexuality and feminism is not accepted, and neither is transgenderism. The onus is on engendering a strong masculine culture, where strength of the male character is valued, because when they are called up for war, they will fight, and not crumble unlike the weak Western male, after decades of targeted emasculation. When the attack comes, the emasculated Western former men will all huddle in their ‘safe spaces’. The masculine Russian and Chinese soldiers will not feel pity or remorse as they plunge their bayonets deep into the simpering soy juiced chemically castrated manjinas huddled around yelping in fear and proclaiming their undying support of feminism. War is coming. It is inevitable because of dwindling finite global resources and increases in population in Third World developing nations. The West may have the technological military advantage however that may not be enough if there are not the numbers to operate with boots on the ground.",1

"T he industry of online gambling is highly popular in the world and, specifically, in the UK. From April 2017 to March 2018, it has made a revenue of ₤4.9 billion. British citizens are lucky enough to be eligible to gamble on licensed online platforms almost without restrictions. Providers have to follow KYC/AML policies and customers have to meet the age requirements, but that’s the necessary limitations. Despite the loyal attitude, the main national authority (the United Kingdom Gambling Commission) focuses on toughening the control over the industry. With the emergence of new technologies like blockchain, a new approach to gambling is being actively discussed. A lot of bloggers, like Katie Wager, analyse the future of online casinos, considering possible legislative changes and technical innovations. Let’s discover the situation, trying to see the future prospects of online betting in the UK. Some background The very first online casino was developed and launched by Microgaming in 1994. A software provider CryptoLogic designed the security system and safe money transfers for this platform. The UK citizens were able to use all online casinos before 2005, when the UKGC was established and the first Gambling Act was signed. In 2014, the new version of this law was presented, forcing every operator, including offshore ones, to get British licenses in order to operate in the UK. The current state of affairs Online casinos are allowed in the United Kingdom if they have been licensed by the local Gambling Commission. British customers can hardly enjoy other operators, as payment systems block money transfers to unlicensed platforms. Still, there are enough official websites to choose from. The Gambling Act of 2005 and its amendment of 2014 are the main legal documents which regulate both offline and online gambling. The UKGC monitors the activity of British and foreign casinos, ban or penalize violators, and propose new laws. The community is anxious as the Commission began to tighten restrictions. Recent and upcoming changes Let’s see what changes can be brought by the UKGC’s decisions and what difference can technical progress make. Legal field The beginning of 2018 was troubling. The Commission stated that it would fight unregulated gambling, as well as introduce new requirements for licensed casinos. The announced changes were related to bonuses and terms and conditions, higher transparency of casino rules, and more information about expenses. According to BBC, the UKGC also consulted with the Remote Gambling Association (RGA) on two approaches: Enhancing self-exclusion systems. GAMSTOP is the official national platform which is going to include all online casinos to allow gamblers to control their experience. Additionally, the British may use GambleAware, which is an independent charity organization focused on popularizing responsible gambling. Regulating advertisements. In the cooperation with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the Commission bans ads which create a fake urgency and trivialize games. Also, the government wants to impose extra fines on casino operators that don’t meet the ASA’s requirements. New rules discussed by the UKGC and the RGA may totally ban ads during live sports events and their translations, excluding horse races. Restrictions will affect online sportsbooks mostly, but casinos should be aware as well. According to the information from iGaming Business, betting companies still have to approve the decision. Moreover, online casinos are under the fire. The Guardian states that in the late November 2018, the UK Gambling Commission penalized four gambling companies because of the failings in anti-money laundering and poor protection from problem gambling. There were huge fines imposed on three companies (Daub Alderney, Casumo, Videoslots), while the fourth one (CZ Holdings) was forced to leave the UK market. At least six more operators are under investigation. Experts say that casinos have to be attentive, as the UKGS is way stricter now than it was a few years ago. It’s not enough to obtain a license but it’s also crucial to meet KYC/AML policies and help gamblers that show addictive behaviour. Tech and innovations Considering these changes, the online gambling industry may move towards decentralization. It’s an extremely competitive sector where casino operators have to provide the best quality and safety to keep their customers loyal. Decentralized systems can fulfill all the demands of modern users who want to be sure about security and transparency of their experience. Blockchain is the most promising innovation that is being implemented by casinos. Blockchain-powered platforms are totally independent of governments and payment systems. Cryptocurrencies are another great feature of blockchain. In refined Bitcoin casinos, gamblers can avoid long expensive transfers with the involvement of third parties. Encryption used for performing crypto transactions is also an important measure of protection. The fate of online casinos in the UK It should be clear that authorities in the UK are going to make online gambling more regulated. Thousands of customers may be upset with this fact: higher fines, banned ads, and runaway operators damage the gambling ecosystem. Thus, new-age systems should enliven the market with innovations like blockchain and crypto. Moreover, as Forbes notes, they can even expand to the land-based gambling facilities, bringing the industry to a new level.",1
"There’s nothing worse for rich people who have to sometimes pass through areas of a city or countryside only to be confronted with unsightly poor people going about their business or rioting in the streets. Seeing an opening in the high end luxury market, a tech company from Paris, France has come up with digital eyewear that simply edits out undesirables and the Untermensch as well as ugly poverty ridden surroundings. “Why see slums when you can look across Lake Geneva?” is the catchy tagline for the digital glasses. “The user specifies what sort of people that the digital AI system will edit out, and through face and gait recognition as well as what type of clothes the person you are looking at is wearing, the system will simply erase them from your view so as not to add offence to your sensibilities. Whether it is the crack addled street scum, welfare recipients, ethnics, tramps, migrants, gypsies or working class people, you will never have to look upon them ever again,” Pierre Martineaux, startup CEO, for eFFACER revealed on Wednesday. The glasses are so sophisticated that they even have sensitive smell sensors embedded on the frame, and can can detect a poor person from over 100 yards. “Poor people have a certain smell, and it’s certainly not Givenchy or Pierre Cardin. This is the first line of defence. Then the image of the person is run across an extensive database, and erased before the wearer notices. Our sophisticated database engine also recognises whether the image is a rich person dressing down, for example ‘shabby chic’ a la pop starlets and actors. These people are not erased from view, because they may be simply champagne socialist celebrities and such,” Martineaux added. The company is so confident of their product that they recently tested the glasses at a Gilets Jaunes violent protest. “I approached the Champs Elysees and I could hear some faint activity, rocks, shouting and sirens through my headphones but nothing bothersome. The glasses however edited out every single person from the riot as they were successfully identified as poor people. All I could see was the boulevard on a warm Parisian summer’s day. It was truly amazing, because I had my headphones on as well and was listening to some delightful adagios from Mozart, so the experience was not unsettling at all,” project engineer, Eric Dugasse revealed. Unfortunately, he was later hit on the head with a pavement stone during the exercise and now has permanent brain damage. Despite small setbacks, the company still plans to go ahead with the first phase of production. The glasses will not come cheap either, as they will only be accessible to the market they are aimed at — the super rich. They will retail at a yearly subscription price of 1.4 million euros. The reasoning behind the subscription model is that the tech is constantly updated, which works to the advantage of the wearer as well as funding further research into the product. “Why upset your day by seeing offensive things like poor people and migrants? We are also designing a new machine learning system that not only edits out poor people and other undesirables, but replaces them with AI depictions of rich people as designated by the wearer. This is not only revolutionary, but will ensure that the rich are not tortured daily by the crass vulgar displays of poverty that are so prevalent in this day and age.” Endorsements for the product have already come in from high, French President Emmanuel Macron has ordered a pair, as has EU President, Jean Claude Juncker. All members of the European Commission will be given complementary pairs funded by EU taxpayers of course. ",1
"In light of Jeremy Corbyn mouthing the words ‘stupid w*man’ after a particularly vicious lashing from PM Theresa May at PMQs, the House of Commons is to ban the word ‘w*man’. Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has already tabled the motion at an emergency parliamentary session shortly after Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn was called in to apologise. The word ‘stupid’ will however not be banned, because it is an adequate description of many who attend the House, and the words they speak could be easily described as ‘stupid’. “It is impossible in this day and age to have such a thing as a ‘stupid w*man’. All wom*n have IQs well above Albert Einstein and he was a measly man not worthy of stupidity. I hereby declare that no w*man can be described as stupid. They are all very intelligent creatures above the level of men. We can still say ‘stupid man’, that is perfectly acceptable because men are now classed as third rate citizens. Furthermore, with regards to Theresa May, I would like to reiterate the point that she is not a ‘stupid w*man’ but a ‘stupid cunt of the highest order'”, one member of the parliamentary committee in charge of stupidity in the House said before being heckled.",1
"I n November 2018, one of the world’s leading software providers NetEnt (Net Entertainment) has launched the full live casino package in Denmark. Now, customers can enjoy all the presented games with real dealers thanks to the brand of Mr Green and its gambling platforms. This is the first entry to the Danish market for the company which provides live games to a lot of customers in several countries. It has solid positions in Europe in general – Net Entertainment casinos rating for UK citizens made by AllHighRollerCasinos.com shows that the brand is especially valued among high rollers. Why NetEnt Live is worth mentioning? How it can boost the gambling experience? What are the most noteworthy innovations and achievements of the provider? Read on to get answers. NetEnt Live features Basically, live casino stands for games with real croupiers broadcasted in real time from a studio. NetEnt’s live games are streamed from specially equipped studios in Malta. Affiliate casino operators use their own websites to integrate these streams and allow gamblers to enjoy this experience. On live platforms, the company provides: Roulette Blackjack Common Draw Blackjack Additionally, the provider has designed the global environment called Exclusive Virtual Casino or EVC. Thanks to it, users can switch between tables without closing the interface. Casino operators can order this system; Mr Green is the first big brand to do this. Apart from games, there is a brand-new automatic system for operators called NetEnt Live Rewards. It allows creating personalized promotional offers, rewarding players with cash or bonuses, and catering products for gamblers. Live Casino is available for both desktop and mobile players on 25 languages. It also supports 25 currencies worldwide. With Chroma Key technique that allows modifying background, casinos can promote their own brands with logos. Live games for new markets In 2017-2018, NetEnt has launched its games in several countries. Most of the projects are limited to betting systems and, sometimes, slots. Only a few partners have enough resources to host live casino, as it remains highly innovative and demanding. Moreover, NetEnt constantly develops new live features to attract more attention to the product. Geographical expansion As we’ve mentioned, entering the Denmark market is the latest milestone of the NetEnt live department. After the launch of the EVC system, Mr Green and Unibet ordered it and presented their own virtual platforms. The former operator provided NetEnt’s live games, including Roulette and two types of Blackjack, to Danish citizens. Mr Green’s Live Beyond Live final system now features a set of tables, seamless streaming quality, professional croupiers, and personalized support for Denmark. Both representatives of NetEnt and Mr Green claimed that such cooperation should benefit brands, expanding their audiences. Henrik Fagerlund from NetEnt says that ‘Mr Green is a perfect partner with a strong presence in Denmark’. Antoine Bonello responds that NetEnt Live can enhance Mr Green’s proposition in Denmark. It’s too early to evaluate results but they may be impressive. In August 2018, NetEnt also has expanded its influence in the UK after making an agreement with William Hill which should provide live games to local customers. This partnership between one of the biggest live casino operators and the company with an innovative approach to live games promises to be fruitful. More than a year ago NetEnt signed a deal with Mozzart to launch both traditional online games and Live Casino in Serbia. The local operator now hosts dozens of entertainments, including Live Roulette and Live Blackjack. NetEnt’s officials stated that they are happy to ‘strengthen positions on regulated markets’ and pleased that Serbian players can enjoy the most popular titles. Apart from focusing on the expansion of NetEnt Live, the provider partnered with a number of casino operators in the following counties: Canada, Lithuania, Norway, Czech Republic, and others. It’s clear the NetEnt is improving its products and spreads its influence. Technical innovations From the beginning of 2018, the provider introduced three new updates to Live Casino. The first one – Live Beyond Live – was developed in cooperation with already mentioned Mr Green and presented during ICE Totally Gaming. Gamblers can enjoy the multi-table system, extra view angles with additional cameras, and smooth interface. Earlier, NetEnt launched other noteworthy innovations: Sports Betting Widget: it allows gambling in live casino games and betting on sports events simultaneously Live Sports Roulette: during this tournament dedicated to the World Cup, players were able to check live results with dealers’ comments NetEnt’s hegemony Considering the active expansion of NetEnt, we can say that the company tries to take a lead among casino software providers. Its main competitors, Microgaming and Playtech, enter new markets a bit slower. With impressive features of NetEnt Live, this brand can attract more customers and casino operators. The partnership with Mr Green shows that NetEnt is on its way to hegemony.",1
"The only way Theresa May can ever vindicate her previous inaction and misguided action, is through an orderly Clean Brexit or as it is labelled by the perpetually afraid — a No Deal Brexit. The government should therefore give businesses more clarity on the processes of a managed Clean Brexit to allay their fears. The rest of the world has been trading perfectly well under WTO rules, as does Britain right now. The Project Fearmongers are a bunch of hysterical Remoaners who are only afraid that they will be cut off from their mother’s teat momentarily, i.e. mother Brussels, who gives them their monthly stipends and backhanders. This is why the government must step up their preparations with extra budgets available for all business in Britain, and tax reductions, as well as tax breaks taken from the £39 Billion which would otherwise have been thrown away into the EU black hole. Theresa May must present a positive view of a Clean Brexit, and all this Millennium Bug scaremongering must be stopped. Anna Soubry who has threatened to resign would be another welcome effect of a Clean Brexit. The contemptuous witch should have been fired and thrown from the party in disgrace a long time ago anyway. The Clean Brexit should become central policy immediately, and it should be embraced as a wonderful opportunity to escape the EU cleanly. If Theresa May does not adhere to this Clean Brexit then she should be removed and a real implementation of the Brexit must be conducted by a Brexiteer. This is the only opportunity for Britain to exit the EU with some dignity and Theresa May to vindicate herself.",1
"To see a desperate Theresa May in Brussels today was a sad sight to behold. What has happened to this once great, proud nation to see the Prime Minister grovelling on her knees to Brussels bureaucrats? No dignity left “I felt some vomit coming up when I saw Theresa May with this desperate forlorn look on her face. She was completely alone whilst the EU bosses all looked at her with pity and derision. Her begging face was out. I just wanted to go over to her and kick her in the shins really hard. It was a disgusting, repulsive view of someone so profoundly weak that it brought on nausea. Thatcher would never have done this. She would have told the lot of them to ‘eff off!’,” a stunned British onlooker revealed. Is the PM stupid? Anyone with any logic would have known that her Brexit in Name Only would never be accepted by parliament because it goes against every concept that was voted for on June 23, 2016 at the EU Referendum. The blame has to also lie with the idiots in charge of the Conservative party who put a Remainer in charge of Brexit. She did not have her heart in it, she exuded a negative vibe about the whole process, then tried to pass through a blatant capitulation to the EU through the backdoor. “I have no sympathy for that thing they call Theresa May. It is an automaton, a programmed robot that just keeps knocking its head against a brick wall. Someone, or something needs to take the fucking batteries out of that thing because it’s making an almighty mockery of Britain,” another shocked observer revealed. The sight of Mrs May dragging the country through the dirt in such a pitiful manner is so sickening, one almost expects her to go to the EU Commission car park and start bukkake dogging sessions with the Brussels bureaucrats all queueing up to get serviced. For god’s sake woman…just resign, at least keep some dignity.",1
"Clandestine operations in China are imperative for the acquisition of data about the Chinese population and communist hierarchy, and this is one of the reasons why Google has been enlisted by Western intelligence agencies to do the dirty work of indirectly siphoning off huge amounts of data from the closed off firewall of China. “You can’t get a better opportunity than this to glean crucial information about the communist Chinese than the Google search engine. The data will go directly to our intelligence agencies and will be utilised for future military operations. We do have some understanding about how the Chinese operate, however we need a more direct line, and thanks to Google, they stepped up,” one former member of the intelligence community revealed. The secretive Chinese have effectively cut off their communist nation from the rest of the world with regards to the internet, and this is why there has to be a cleaner more agreeable method of information acquisition. Human rights activists have recently voiced their concerns about Google venturing into the Chinese market due to the brutal nature of the communist regime in dealing with those who are not accepted by the communist party ideology, however this is no concern to Google or intelligence agencies. They just see the people who are arrested and brutally tortured by the Chinese authorities as collateral damage in a bigger game. The data acquired will be of huge interest especially when it comes to the financial markets, global economics, and internal communist operations, as well as general information about the Chinese population as a whole. China has been conducting blatant acts of stealing classified information from the West for some time, so this time, Google will be doing the honours for the West. What is certain, is that the information which will be received from China with Operation Dragonfly will serve the West well. Another certainty, which has now been confirmed as a definite is that Google is a defacto arm of the United States military intelligence cloaked in a civilian disguise, that is now flapping in the wind, uncovered for all to see.",1
"Jean Claude Juncker was emphatic that the current BRINO deal will never be renegotiated by Brussels. Theresa May faffing around sniffing bottoms in Brussels will not achieve anything, and everyone knows it. End of story. Therefore, every Conservative MP who votes to keep on Theresa May in the no confidence vote is effectively voting for a BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal which is the only thing May is committed to producing. There are some claims that May is saying she will step down before a general election, but only after she puts through her BRINO deal. This is not acceptable to Leave voters, and is a blatant betrayal. Those MPs who thus vote to support May are not fit for purpose and have effectively betrayed every Leave voter who voted on June 23, 2016. Sir Bernard Jenkins, is definitely voting to oust May, and he has been one of the only logical people speaking about this no confidence vote. In these circumstances, it should be known that many will feel extremely angry by Theresa May staying on just so she can push through her Brexit capitulation through parliament. The only way therefore to get rid of Theresa May, as the Conservatives are not fit to do so, is through a general election. If anyone has any ideas about how to force a general election please leave a comment below. We suspect it may have something to do with the DUP. They just need to withdraw their support for May’s government et voila..",1
"On the eve of the no confidence vote on Theresa May’s non-leadership of the Tory party, and her complete muck up of the Brexit, there are some who are hoping that she stays in and plods along for another election — cue the Labour party. Jeremy Corbyn’s party are keeping their fingers crossed that the idiots who support May carry on doing so, because she is the passport to a Labour win at the next General election. “We know for sure that real Brexiteers will never vote Tory again if they keep Theresa May, and they will never support her BRINO deal. That’s votes lost for the Tories right there, 17.4 million odd. Labour will win the election because the Tories have effectively abandoned their grassroots voters,” a Labour election campaigner revealed today. After May’s roasting at the hands of Corbyn today at PMQ’s there is no doubt who has the upper hand in parliament and it’s not Theresa May, who cannot even command any sort of relevant leadership. The Tories will be stupid to keep May, but Labour is counting on the stupidity and greed of the Conservatives, no doubt many have been bribed with promises of kushy seats in the House of Lords for May’s support. It does not matter a jot whether May stays on and promises to go after Brexit, but before an election. The evil deed will have been done, the Brexit betrayal will have been committed, and for real Brexiteers this is enough. They will never vote Tory ever again. Every day, every hour, every second that May is kept on, Labour grows stronger, because they know now that THEY will have the votes at the next election and not the Tories led by an old boot, not fit for the knackers yard.",1
"Please we petition all sane MPs within the Conservative party to oust this Brussels automaton Theresa May. Forty eight letters of no confidence in dodgy Theresa May’s leadership have been placed with the 1922 Committee now, and the vote will hopefully be positive this evening. The PM’s nonsense Project Fear about delaying Brexit because of a new leader is absolute shit. What the PM is proposing is not a Brexit anyway, and will tie the UK with EU indefinitely. Anything is better than what she is proposing. Anything! Even if Brexit is delayed, at least it will be a real Brexit by a Brexiteer and not Theresa May’s BRINO. May has said that she is now having to stay in London tonight and deal with a vote of no confidence (boo hoo) instead of negotiating with the EU, when Juncker has definitely put down the clause that there is NO MORE NEGOTIATION. We need a leader who is positive about Britain’s exit from the EU, who believes in Brexit and does not capitulate to Brussels at every opportunity. Once she is ousted, there has to be a comprehensive clean-out of Remainers from the Cabinet and other positions within power. This is the only way we will have Brexit, and there is no other way. The DS questioned the efficacy of having Remainers in charge of Brexit in 2016, and we knew then that it would never work. Thank the gods of parliament and democracy that MPs are finally waking up to what the Daily Squib knew all along. Lord Haw Haw Hammond as the Chancellor of the Exchequer has actively thwarted Brexit at every turn. There has to be a change before Brexit can be realised properly, and if there is no change, then the problems will persist on and on until the Conservative party is completely decimated, and the nation is stuck with a Brexit deal which is not Brexit but an indefinite imprisonment to Brussels. We need action NOW more than ever to oust Theresa May who has completely squandered her position and betrayed the British people. May is a festering pustule bubbling on the flaming arse of Beelzebub and needs to be lanced immediately for the good of the country and parliament. Kick Theresa May and Philip Hammond into the sewers where they belong. If Theresa May is not thrown out, no Leave voter will ever vote Conservative again. ",1
"“It’s got power steering, a V12 engine, and a sun roof, this is the latest Lamborghini model,” car saleswoman Dodgy Theresa May declares as she points to a 1986 Datsun. “‘ere I’ve got a good one from Europe last week, sold to me by a chap called Juncker, this thing can go at 12 MPH and not break a sweat,” Dodgy Theresa points proudly at a supermarket cart from Lidl. “Look at this beauty (pointing at a beaten up Mazda circa 1987) it still has the same old trim and cigarette butts in the ashtray. If you look closely you can see the semen stains in the back. This one is up on offer, but you better hurry because I have a few non existent customers coming soon to check it out, so make the purchase quick,” a proud Dodgy Theresa quips. Despite being the chief sales person on the lot, useless Theresa hasn’t been able to sell anything for over two years. Her bosses in Brussels, Belgium are thinking of canning her, with a replacement soon. “Yes, yes, I got a call from my bosses in Europe yesterday. They said I’m fucking useless and should be sent to the glue factory. I said, watch this! I will sell all the cars on the lot by 12 tomorrow!” a defiant artful dodger Theresa recalled. Naturally, Dodgy Theresa chickened out of her dare, and was last seen cowering under her desk in the office. Oh dear, where has it all gone wrong for Dodgy Theresa? What a nightmare. Anyway, would you ever buy a used car from Dodgy Theresa? We thought not.",1

"Worried Number 10 aides are concerned for the welfare of ailing PM Theresa May (aka Madame Frit) and have noticed an uncomfortable change in her demeanour. “When she announced she would postpone to vote on her BRINO deal just to save her position as PM, I noticed a distinct smell of urine, and a yellow complexion come over her,” the aide revealed. Theresa May’s makeup artist has also had trouble covering up the cowardly PM, who would rather see the country and her party destroyed than resign. “She came in for her morning fit up, and as I brushed the makeup on her, my brush was stained yellow. It also stank of the trousers of an old tramp. I plastered another even thicker layer of makeup but the urine smell did not come off and her complexion was even more yellowy.” It’s also funny because Theresa “Dodgy” May is also known as a liar, and her nose seems to be growing as well. “Theresa May is now an unhonourable lying piece of cowardly shit. Most of us knew this from the beginning, however it is now known by everyone,” another aide quipped as the PM suddenly entered the room unannounced. Unfortunately folks we will have to put up with the festering fermenting cowardly maw of Theresa May for a longer time. This means she will have to be effectively shoe-horned out of the post, but can her equally cowardly ministers manage that job? ",1
"You see them walking down the street, maybe you are one of them yourself – smartphone zombies. You see them in restaurants meant to be dining with their friends, they are all staring at their smartphones instead of talking with each other. You see the mother pushing that pram ignoring her crying distraught child as she is entranced with her smartphone. These people are being programmed without their knowledge, their subconscious minds are imprisoned, their minds have been fractured to such a point that these people now behave like a hive mind controlled by their smartphones. As the queue for the latest model of iPhone extends around the block these people are no longer in charge of their wallets, let alone their minds. There is a cure, you can break away from this digital prison which you have been sucked into, you do not have to be controlled like this anymore. We present ways in which you can relinquish the control over your mind, you do not have to be an automaton anymore, your do not have to follow the hive mind anymore, and once you break free, you will think for yourself, you will feel an extreme serenity, and relief over your whole self. You will feel human again, and your zombie phone days will be over. This process will be hard for you, but your fractured, honeycomb mind will be allowed to reprocess itself – almost like a reboot, a fresh start. Steps to Break Away from Being a Smartphone Zombie 1 – Delete your Facebook account. Log in to Facebook. Click the Privacy button in the top-right (the icon is shaped like a padlock) and choose See More Settings. Click Security. Click Deactivate Your Account. Choose a reason for leaving from using the checkbox list. Click the checkbox next to Opt out of receiving future emails from Facebook. Click Confirm. Enter your password and click Deactivate Now. 2 – Delete your Twitter account. Sign into your account on the Twitter website. Click on Settings and Privacy from the drop-down menu under your profile icon. In the Account section of the menu, click Deactivate your account. Click Deactivate. Enter your password when prompted and click Deactivate account. 3 – Delete all other social network accounts you have on your phone. 4 – Put down your phone. Go outside, take your shoes and socks off. Put your feet on some grass, stand up, open your eyes and look up. You will notice the sky, the clouds, the wind in the trees, the birds, insects, and stand there looking around noticing things you may have not in the past when you were tethered to the phone. Take deep breaths, you are nearly free. 5 – You only need a phone for emergency and necessary calls. If you must buy a mobile phone, buy one with only the bare functions. We advise the Light Phone, a stylish minimalist phone or the MP01. 6 – Congratulate yourself, you are already a few steps ahead of all the zombies around you. From now on you will notice these poor people with their zombie phone stoop in public and you will see what you have escaped from. Please do not think you are completely out of the woods yet, because you still will have many temptations put in front of you daily to return to a zombie hive mind state. 7 – You must resist with all your being if you are ever tempted by social media or zombie smartphone return. You must now remember what it was like to connect with other humans by looking them in the eye, being consciously aware, paying attention and connecting to whatever is around you at the time you are there. You are interacting with people and their actual self being whereas a mobile phone zombie is constantly thinking about their phone or the latest Facebook comment. 8 – As more people break away from the hive mind digital prison, then the controllers will lose their war to imprison, dumb down and control humanity. We urge you dear reader, please move forward, reclaim your true creative humanity and your ability to think for yourself. You can do this, you can break free and live a happy existence away from what they have created to kill your mind and spirit. Remember that the late Steve Jobs and current Silicon Valley tech hierarchy severely limit the use of smartphones and ipads for their children for a very good reason, they know the consequences of these machines and how they are being proliferated worldwide to control and subvert populations.

"I t is very important for the internet casinos that you register to exercise virtuous standards of gambling. This is very important as you do not want to get caught in the wrong end of the play for no fault of yours. It is highly important for you to ensure that the online games provider you are choosing is legitimate and carries the regulation and the license from the respective organisations to run the site. You need to stay clear of all the unethical casinos in order to protect your personal and financial information from getting leaked over the internet. Casinos Need to Support Customers It is not just the betting houses, but there are even certain gamblers who carry out unethical practices and spoil the reputation and the name of the betting site. The best of the best gambling sites uphold the laws and the rules and regulations to run their business. They do everything in their might to protect the interests of their genuine customers. The laws apply to each and everybody who becomes a member of the casino and is not limited to a certain group of people. If a betting site imposes a law that is confined to just a certain group of players, then this is not a reputable option followed by the gaming house. Such gambling centres should not be allowed to operate and they must be opposed. There is no way a business can charge two different amounts for the same products on different customers. A gaming club is in this business to make profits and no one is against this. But, it has to make profits in the right manner and without cheating the general public or their customers. Problems that Gaming Houses Face There is a wide range of unethical problems that an internet or mobile casino face these days. The biggest challenge faced in recognising and finding out the undesirables singing up. There are many excluders and the banned people who can easily try to get access to the betting houses online. It is very important that they make use of the best regulatory and security measures to safeguard their business and that also without causing any disturbance to their business functioning and also their genuine customers. There are certain unprincipled groups looking to upset a gambling den’s apple cart and the business needs to be having a strict vigil on them. If they fail to have a grip over these unruly elements or groups, then they can have a serious impact on the fiscal of the site. The wrong practices are a serious troublemaker to all the concerned areas of the gaming house. There need to be proper and thought through measures to be implemented to get over the immoral doings that are causing problems to the casino industry. What Falls Under the Unethical Practices Sphere? The following are some of the important factors that fall under the ambit of dishonourable practices in an online gambling industry. The resorting to deception, cheating, and dishonesty standards by the unruly elements; Misrepresentation of the facts with the aim to create confusion and suspicion in the minds of genuine customers; Emotional blackmail and manipulation of the people to make the most out of their helplessness; The desire to gain massive profits and to achieve it with all kinds of illegal ways; Creating false reports and documents to show increased profits; Trying to avoid the penalties and paying out the compensations for the wrong deeds and acts; Not being transparent enough and trying to dodge the government investigations; Gaining access to the privacy of the members to gain their personal and financial information. How to Correct Unethical Behavior? Bring in the Business Ethics Culture There needs to be a business ethics that should be formulated by the casino so that the workers are fully aware of the rules of the trade and try to practice them. The people must be given the freedom and liberty to raise their voice if they see any wrong practices happening around. There need to be seminars conducted for the employees about ethical business practices followed. Compliance Officers It is important for the compliance officers to be in place to check out any unruly behaviours happening in the casino world. They should be having strict vigil against unruly elements joining as the workers or customers. They should always be on the lookout for any abuse, deception, cheating, or bribery taking place. Encouragement for Ethical Members The people who work to practice the casino ethical standards must be recognized and also be awarded for their good deeds. This will rub off among the other members and customers and they also will start to practice principled standards when working or playing in the betting den. When there is no lack of company ethics and the online and brick and mortar gaming houses practice moral standards, they are sure to see great business profits.",1
"News just in, PM Theresa May is going to have a mass debate on the BBC it has been confirmed today. TV bosses were however not sure who or when the PM will have a mass debate with, because she keeps ducking and diving in and out of the debate. “She calls me and says she will have a mass debate session with Jeremy Corbyn watching, but there will be no Brexiteers allowed on the show. Then after five minutes she calls back cancelling her mass debate so we cancel everything. Two minutes later she calls and says she will have a mass debate with herself but filmed by us to be broadcast after the watershed,” an exhausted BBC executive revealed today. One of the PM’s aides, John Sommers, was indignant about the whole affair. It’s a sticky problem “I just told her, come on, pull your fingers out. You’re already knuckles deep in it. You have to have this mass debate otherwise people won’t take you seriously anymore. Trying to get the PM to make a decision is like rubbing a forty day old pollock until all the fish juice squirts out all over the carpet, imagine the smell of it.” After much wrangling, it has been officially confirmed Theresa May will have her mass debate on telly, this Saturday. She will be mass debating with herself and trying to convince herself that her Brexit In Name Only bad deal is what people want. “The PM firmly believes in repetition. For example, if you say a lie to people long enough, not only do they start to believe your lies, but eventually you will believe your own lies. That is the way the cookie crumbles,” the PM’s aide added. ",1
"Art depicting the female form is now banned at the new puritanical Tumblr Western civilisation is often proud of its freedom of speech and lack of censorship. In the past two decades, considerable results have been achieved in the fight for human rights, especially regarding LGBT members and women. However, it seems within the last several years the once easy-going West has reverted back to the puritanical Middle Ages, with new censorious Soviet-style restrictions appearing thus silencing the voices of the minority and adults in general. Tumblr is a place where people create blogs, find friends, and share everything one could even think of. Discussions of LGBT representation in media, explicit fan fiction and fan-art, sharing of nude pictures — Tumblr allowed the exploration of one’s sexuality. It was common to see posts like “small breasts are absolutely valid” or “check wellhello com review here and let’s meet”, with people eliminating such concepts as body shaming and sex work/dating sites negativity. Now, though, everything has sadly changed. Tumblr’s New Policy Tumblr has around 450 million blogs. As of December 17, the following rules become active. · No explicit and graphic content, including photos, gifs, and fan-art; · Especially no sex-related content; · Especially no ‘female-presenting nipples’. Needless to say, such news shocked every single user of the once liberty driven site. The last category has become particularly horrific yet hilarious, with people exchanging pics ten times more actively, letting Tumblr staff guess which nipples could be recognized as female. Apparently, Tumblr officially recognizes male nipples as less sexy than those of females, but what about transgenders or people with breast scars who want to discuss their stories? Tumblr claims that banning explicit content is to safeguard “children”, which is strange indeed since children are not supposed to be on Tumblr in the first place. So, how does Tumblr intend to achieve its new policy? Tumblr’s Actual New Policy As of now, Tumblr has managed to do the following: · Flagged every second non-explicit post related to LGBT, including text posts, all of which are supposed to be allowed; · Flagged works of art and sculptures with and without nudity; · Flagged bread; · Flagged its own post with a new policy announcement. Hysterical laughter is the only reaction Tumblr users are now experiencing. There is much speculation discussing the fact that Tumblr was kicked off Apple and wants to return there, that it wants to secure the support of family-friendly organizations, etc. Which is the truth? No one knows. However, it is undoubtedly an act of censorship that targets LGBT members and women in particular. Tumblr’s new anti-sex policy is proving to be anti-LGBT and anti-female, and millions of users, including minorities and sex workers, are risking losing their safe harbor. In an attempt to eliminate healthy sexual self-expression, Tumblr even accidentally banned itself. It would have been funny if it wasn’t so disastrous, especially considering the century we live in.",1

"Many high end businesses are now not hiring women for a very good reason, #MeToo. Male bosses are advising the limit of risk, and this includes no dinner with female colleagues, never sit next to them on flights, do not talk to them in a room alone, book a hotel room on another floor, never hire them unless extremely necessary. “Essentially big finance has cut off all ties with women, simply because they are too high risk. You not only have risk of saying the wrong thing by accident and being #MeToo pilloried, or having a woman accuse you of sexual misconduct, or the added risk for the business with women becoming pregnant adding on huge costs like maternity leave. The list is too long to mention here, but we just don’t hire them anymore. It’s as simple as that,” one CEO at a top trading firm in Wall Street revealed. Even talking to a woman at work is now risky because of the #MeToo era, anything a man says can be construed as sexist, offensive or demeaning. “We have one who works on our floor. We just nod at her or grunt a hello and walk past. You just can’t say anything else because of the lawsuits and Twitter,” a scared male employee revealed. The risk limiting is also now extending to the White House, where Vice President Mike Pence recently revealed that he avoids dining with women other than his wife. “The golden rule from now on is never speak to a female colleague at work, avoid them at all costs. If you have to speak to a woman and it is necessary for the job, you must have at least four witnesses present, and all the doors open, even if it is meant to be a private matter. The best way to avoid all of the hassle is not hiring women, and we are adopting this rule as number one. We just can’t function properly with that kind of threat hanging over us every day, so we limit the risk by deleting the risk, you know what I mean?” another Wall Street boss revealed. Looks like the days of the Wolf of Wall Street are far gone.",1
"“Christmas celebrates the birth of a male child, and he is given gifts by three male Kings, and the manger he was born in was owned by a man. This is pure sexism. The only female present is the mother of Jesus who was impregnated by a patriarchal God, a masculine one,” #MeToo supporter, Loretta Atmos, told the Huffington Post. Another #MeToo activist went as far as saying that “Christmas is evil because all male babies should be aborted at birth. Why celebrate another male born into this world?” The #MeToo anger has been spreading across Twitter with similar sentiment, and the hashtag #BanXmasMeToo is trending. There is further outrage at the tradition of the festive holiday, for example, the Christmas tree symbolises an erect phallus and is meant to celebrate fertility in the new equinox. When people are decorating their Christmas trees, they are effectively dangling baubles over a large erect penis. Definitely not a #MeToo woman One twitter #MeToo respondent was so disgusted by Christmas trees she wants them all banned as well. “We should not only ban Xmas because it is a patriarchal sexist holiday, but those awful phallic Xmas trees. Everything about it is masculine. Plus think about all those trees being chopped down each year. We could save whole forests.”",1
"Things have no doubt changed for the Windsors. Sadly for many of the members, it’s all very PC, and hunting has been given the shunt, as well as other little traditional regal institutions of the crown like blatant jocular racism. Our emissaries ensconced deep in the firm tell us wondrous stories of how the changes have somewhat irked the established members. “If one wants to shout at the television after a particular news report resplendent with savages running amuck and that sort of thing, one has to be careful. The PC Princess as we call her has ears as sensitive as Prince Philip’s bowel movements,” a source revealed. Hunting is now out of the question when Meghan is around, and that goes for the Blood Rite, as well. “It’s not only the hunting that has gone, but consider this fact, pretty much every object or statue around the palaces are from Britain’s illustrious history of conquest and imperial superiority. Wherever Meghan goes, she now asks where this piece or that piece was stolen from, and how many indigenous people died for the relinquishment of said objects. On a visit to the Tower of London, Meghan was so angered at the sight of the diamonds on the regent’s crown she declared that they should be sold off to feed the slum children of India. “One must also feel a deep pity for Prince Harry, here is a lad who is used to dipping one’s wick into an assortment of different pots served up to him on a platter, a man of varied taste. Needless to say, now that Meghan is preggers the fun is over, and Harry has been left with his wick in the wind, doomed to only one flavour for the rest of the marriage.” Certainly things have changed amongst the Windsors, as social meetings are now more subdued. The Duke of Edinburgh has effectively been silenced completely, and is not permitted a single word now. Instead he sits silently in the corner mumbling to himself. If he does dare to utter a word or even a sentence, he is immediately re-silenced with some hor d’oeuvres served up by his personal butler and another dose of opiates. There have been some rumours about some shenanigans between the two duchesses, Meghan and Kate. “One of them is honed, well trained in royal protocol and docile, the other is a wild unknown import who is used to saying and getting what she wants and is obviously stifled by royal protocol and British sensibilities. It’s like placing a peasant sugar cane farmer from Papua New Guinea amongst aristocrats, the culture shock is too great. Not that nothing can be achieved, it just will need a lot of time and training,” another aide revealed.",1
"Theresa May campaigned strongly for Remain during the EU Referendum - photo - Twitter No Brexiteers allowed in the head-to-head TV debate, no Brexiteers in the Treasury, no Brexiteers in the Bank of England, no Brexiteers in the Cabinet, No brexiteers allowed to negotiate with the EU, no Brexiteers in BBC discussions, no Brexiteers in Whitehall etc.. Brexiteers have been vilified, labelled as extremists, called dumb, and completely denounced, ignored from the EU negotiations or debate. Remainer, Theresa May, and her adjutant, Oily Robbins, a staunch remainer, have effectively hijacked the whole Brexit process, and have proposed a deal which leaves the UK completely vulnerable to the EU, and ties it in to the Customs Union, indefinitely thus relinquishing any way of conducting global trade deals. The remainer PM, has even gone through two ‘Brexit secretaries’ a job which is nothing more than a glorified tea boy, with no power or role in the process of exiting the EU. The EU referendum, was the largest democratic vote ever held in the UK, and 52% voted to Leave the EU. We are not dumb, we knew very well what this entailed. It meant leaving the EU Customs Union, the ECJ, the CAP, the CFP, the Single Market and all the other EU constructs designed to imprison countries, whilst making Brussels and the few favoured nations running the show richer. It’s as simple as that. If we had a Brexiteer as PM, we would have been out of the EU two years ago, and forging trade deals now. The Irish backstop is something created by remainers and the EU to thwart a full exit. It makes no logical sense to have a remainer as PM in charge of Brexit, or all the other remainers who are pulling their remainer strings in positions of power. There is no other recourse but to instate a Brexit leader immediately. Theresa May, is a duplicitous liar, who has been shown to have used corrupt processes to thwart Brexit at every turn, and is now even stopping the publication of her Attorney General’s legal advice, which even Tony Blair did not do before the Iraq war was erroneously pushed through parliament. Now is the time to act, because there is plenty of evidence of wrongdoing on Theresa May’s part, she must be impeached, given a vote of no confidence and summarily booted from office. Do it now. ",1
"Paris is burning. The tear gas sears the Parisian air leaving clouds of grey noxious smoke infiltrating every part of the once peaceful boulevards. The barricades, some on fire, are resting places for any furniture that can be found, at one road, an upright piano has been deposited in the middle. Amongst the clattering of stones and canisters, a solitary man in a yellow jacket is playing the Marseillaise, but is cut short as a phalanx of riot troops converge on his position. It is the noise that hits you at first, the whistles, the explosions, the clattering, the shouts of the injured, the French sirens, an all encompassing sound of rage that fills the boulevards. One can only imagine the terror of the residents looking out of their plush apartments at the mayhem and destruction below. It is close to Christmas in Paris, and the trees have been decorated with lights on the Champs-Élysées, their juxtaposition of violence and protest leaves an uneasy duality. The decorations for Christmas, this time are burning barricades, exploding vehicles, and cowering policemen. The water cannons move in further, and the protesters are forced away from one particular zone, as other protesters erupt from a different zone. It all seems futile for the outnumbered police, as they simply move from one place to another not achieving anything at all. These riots, they say, will go on and on, until the government capitulates its position and reduces tax on fuel. The revenue lost from tourism must be enormous, as well as the shops and restaurants which have been forced to close. Louis Vuitton, Bally, and all the others, now bathed in fire and smoke, their luxurious brands, engulfed by revolution and violence. How long can Emmanuel Macron hold out? The Gilets Jaunes, seem unstoppable in their vitriol and are dedicated in their outrage.",1
"After reviewing the wonderful Jeremy Corbyn Annual 2018 we were confronted this time by a troop of U.S. secret servicemen all wearing the same suits, the same haircuts, and same dark glasses. One of them stepped forward, looked left, then right, and slapped a brown envelope into our reviewer’s face. “Review this book. It better get an A+ or (wipes finger across his neck whilst smiling).” Looking up, they were all gone, vamoos, vanished. The Unofficial Donald Trump Annual 2019, published by Pavilion Books, written by Adam G. Goodwin, Dicken Goodwin, and Jonathan Parkyn was now in our weary hands. Flicking through this annual, one advises the reader to have a pen, and scissors handy, because you’re going to have a lorra lorra fun cutting out masks and such. The exercises and puzzles within the book will no doubt bring joy and happiness to the whole family, with cut-outs of Kim Jong-un and styling tips to get that perfect Donald hair-do, and a whole section dedicated to fake news. Trumpaholics will love the dreamy Donald pin-ups and pictures, they can cut out and add to their van’s exterior whilst planning their next failed excursion against those dastardly Dems. We of course say this all in jest and do not advise anyone to even think about it. The Teflon Don, as we like to call him, can have a bucket of shit poured over his head, yet still come away untouched and smelling of roses. Such is his propensity to weather any Stormy storm dispatched against him by those fake news peddling stinking socialist Dems and crooked lawyers. In honour of the orange one, why not get a piece of orange and pour some melted chocolate over it, or build a wall of waffles 12 feet high with maple syrup as the cement? If you eat that load and do not projectile vomit over your cat, all the better for you, at least the migrant caravan could not get across the border. Just buy the Donald Trump Annual 2019 and stick it in the Christmas stocking, will ya? You and the family will not be disappointed with hours of entertainment and vomitous sticky fun. ",1
"Former U.S. President George H. Bush It is a sad day today, the father of Dubya, September 11, Iraq wars, and a burgeoning post Soviet NWO 911 future as stated in the Project for a New American Century, George H. Bush, is finally dead. George Herbert Walker Bush came from good stock, his father Prescott Sheldon Bush, was one of the American bankers who helped fund the Nazis. Along with Brown Brothers Harriman, and UBC, Hitler’s rise to power was assured. “If it was not for George Herbert Bush who spawned Dubya, that PNAC stated Pearl Harbor moment on September 11, which led to the 2nd Gulf War, would never have happened. People needed a uniting impetus to enlist, and to agree to both wars in Afghanistan and Iraq — 911 was a beautifully engineered example. The wars achieved a remarkable statistic of over 2 million Muslims killed or displaced from their homes. American companies were given first dibs at oil contracts in Iraq, the second largest oil fields in the world. The ongoing campaign was also the precept for the Syrian war, which has seen further bloodshed in the Middle East,” a former aide revealed proudly. America is now in mourning, for a great servant to its nation, and a man whose legacy will live on for many centuries to come.",1
"The gloating EU technocrats are sniggering in public at their triumph over Britain, with Theresa May’s lacklustre BRINO capitulation. “We laugh in the face of your Chamberlain PM, as she bows down and kisses my shoe. You Britisher swine will always serve us, we are your masters, we have the power, Britisher Schweinhund,” Colonel Selmayr told Bild magazine. Disgrace to democracy Britain is certainly receiving a just punishment for the folly of having Remainers put in charge of Brexit. The fault of this firmly falls on the hierarchy of the Conservative party who put Theresa May and her Remainer Cabinet in charge. “What do you think was going to happen? You put a Remainer in charge of Brexit. That’s like putting a florist in charge of an abattoir or a dustman in charge of a banking consortium to manage major international deals. It ain’t gonna happen,” one man with some sense quipped. Theresa May is also charged with deliberately denying the publication of her attorney general’s legal advice to parliament, because it reveals the fact that the UK cannot extricate itself from EU control and power after her so-called Brexit. She is thus deliberately misleading parliament and is committing a crime of treason against the UK. Treacherous May even refused an offered trade deal from Trump’s USA a few months ago. The dishonest PM has also been caught giving a Knighthood to one of her cronies to gain their support for her deal. Dishonourable Theresa May is a disgrace and must be forced to resign when she loses the vote for her BRINO in parliament in two weeks time. ",1
"Yep, it was called the Battle of Britain, and it left Hitler’s Luftwaffe with an almighty bloody nose, and it was a Clean No Deal Brexit. When it comes to the crunch Brits will fight to save Britain from an EU that has shown extreme disrespect, gloated over any misfortune we have had, stolen our fish, and bullied this country for too long whilst making it pay through the nose for the indignity. Are you just going to sit there and take it? No! We need a clean Brexit, a clean slate, a clean tabletop to rebuild this country after years of subservience to an EU that clearly detests us, they use us like a cash cow, they veto everything we propose, and they dictate to us over our own laws. Supermarine Spitfire PR XI PL965 Remember those brave men and women who struggled against the incessant bombing, the doodlebugs, the fires, the Stukas and Messerschmitts. Do not dishonour their memory like Mrs Theresa ‘Petain’ May, who wants to create a Vichy government for her masters in Brussels. We need our fighting spirit back, and we need our freedom totally free so we can bring back sovereignty to our parliament once again, to forge our own trade deals, and to make our own laws free from the diktats and totalitarian orders from the EU. We must join with our true allies, America and Australia, and the Commonwealth countries once again, not only in trade but in true partnership. We must also bring manufacturing to these shores once again, and get the Made in Britain stamp back in service. We do not owe Brussels anything, and this is why paying £39 billion is the biggest failure anyone can propose. They can stick it! Yes, things will be slightly hard at first, but coming out of a prison is not easy. We have been in darkness for too long, in slavery to masters that are unelected bureaucrats, out of touch, pampered with vast limitless expense accounts who do not care for our nation or our people. It is time to embrace freedom once again, and if this means fighting for it, so be it.",1
"You have to hand it to the French, when an indignity such as a massive Macron fuel tax rise is foisted on them — they act, they riot, they actually do something about it. Here in the UK, no such thing is done. Whatever indignity is thrown on the masses with massive tax rises, they simply grumble about it a bit, then put on another cup of tea. If the French had to deal with the amount of tax rises we British have to deal with, there would be nothing left by now but rubble. French President, Emmanuel Macron, has simply scoffed at the protests and remains safely ensconced in his palace. “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche,” the president exclaims from his boudoir, to accentuate the point about how out of touch he is with the peasants. The struggling Gilets Jaunes peasants, especially in expensive Paris, are living in literal poverty anyway, so to increase taxes on fuel to such a level not only hurts their means of transport, but increases the prices of daily goods to be transported to the shops, thus pushing prices up on everything as a result. How will Macron get out of this mess he has made? To capitulate to the protesters will obviously be a sign of extreme weakness, so no doubt Macron will continue with the riots and simply beat the opposition into submission, eventually. Either that or a resignation is in order.",1
"L ast year, gambling operators in the UK spent just under 1.8 bn euros on marketing, with nearly half of the amount covering internet-based advertising and a mere 15% buying TV commercials. The trend is obvious: marketing expenditure is skyrocketing. In fact, according to a report by strategic consultancy Regulus Partners titled Gambling Advertising and Marketing Spend, it rose by 56% from 2014 to 2017. Today, there are numerous online gambling providers operating in the UK. For more information on the most popular ones, check out the fastest payout online casinos. Online promotion of such operators uses direct, social media and affiliate marketing methods. The former includes banners and paid search. Other advertising channels are television, sponsorship, and offline channels, such as print media and billboards. The Breakdown Online marketing accounts for 80% of the total gambling marketing expenditure, with direct methods amounting to almost half (48%) of it. While direct internet marketing doubled over the three-year period, social media advertising more than tripled – rising from £42m in 2014 to £149m three years later. Affiliate marketing, which includes tipsters, websites and publications that generate new business for a commission, was the slowest, climbing from £282m to £301m, which is 20% of the overall marketing spend. As a lion’s share of marketing budgets is now spent online, television advertising is lagging behind, despite the growth from £155m to £234m. The amounts spent on sponsorship were still relatively moderate despite their doubling: advertising on football shirts, horse racing, and other events totaled £60m in 2017. It is important to note that as detailed marketing cost breakdown is commercially confidential, it is impossible to obtain definitive figures. The consultancy used audited accounts of the largest listed operators, as well as figures for offshore and private companies. The estimates, therefore, are sufficiently credible. Most importantly, they demonstrate the relative scope of online marketing. The Consequences The mentioned figures raise serious ethical issues. The Gambling Commission has recently reported that as much as 59% of children aged 11-16 have been exposed to the ads on social networks. For television commercials, the proportion is even greater – 66%. According to Marc Etches, CEO of GambleAware, a leading UK charity, children following gambling operators on social media are three times more likely to spend money on gambling. “Compared to other potentially harmful activities, the rate of gambling in the past week among young people is higher than the rates of drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes and taking illegal drugs”. This data points to the urgent need to perceive gambling as a threat to children and a public health issue. Social networks and websites must recognize their moral obligation to protect the youngest and the most susceptible ones. It is thus imperative to increase public awareness of the potential dangers posed by the activity.",1
"Shameful PM Theresa May is to release a book giving tips on how to bargain, Number 10 Downing Street has revealed. “If the price of the apple is 35 pence, this is when I give the shopkeeper £2.60,” a quote from one of the lessons shows. There are also tips on how to haggle. “Say if I wanted to buy an antique model of a donkey made in China in 2012 to put on my mantle piece for sale at a local market. The man may say to me “That’ll be £40,000 please!” and I will answer “Here you go!” and hand over the money. Plus you have to show always that you’re really excited and fixated on the thing you want to buy, so the seller can raise the price as much as he wants.” One section of Theresa May’s 3 page manual even advises people on how to negotiate with the EU. “They come into the room and say that they want this, this and that. I then capitulate to everything they ask without a word. After all they are my master, and I am a mere servant. Also, before leaving the room of any EU official, you must bow down and touch the ground with your nose, then back out the door facing them. Don’t forget to leave £39 billion behind before you leave, or your masters will become very angry. “One must always make sure when bargaining that you let it be known that you will not walk away even if the deal is so bad that the person you are bargaining with is literally laughing in your face. It is better to be a shameful coward with no backbone or guts than to cause any trouble by actually standing up for yourself or actually bargaining,” Mrs May notes on page 2. The book called “The Art of the Bargain” will not be serialised in the Daily Telegraph this Sunday but will be found in every bargain bucket across the country by Tuesday.",1
"Willkommen Germans invite more mass migration into the country Apparently Hillary Clinton has finally awoken to the same conclusion the Daily Squib came to in 2011, albeit in a satirical article. Europe needs a tougher approach on immigration in order to curb the growing threat of right-wing populists, Hillary Clinton said, calling on EU leaders to show their electorates that they can no longer “provide refuge and support.” “I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame,” Clinton said in an interview with the Guardian published Thursday. Reading a quote from the 2011 Daily Squib article entitled “How Long Before the EU Concentration Camp Chimneys Start Churning Smoke Again?” confirms Clinton’s diagnosis in 2018. We saw the warning signs, before anyone else did. Even in the UK, there are increasing reports of racially charged assaults and outbursts by seemingly ‘normal white people’, but these are mere symptoms of the Hegelian dialectic where the problem of increased immigration was allowed and encouraged to happen by successive governments for a very good reason — to create discord, disharmony, hatred and fear amongst the indigenous populations. An immigration open door policy was allowed to occur so as to create a problem of overcrowding in urban areas; destruction of indigenous culture, valuable resources being used up, intolerance and racism to flourish. “First you create the problem, then you wait for the people to cry out, then you move in with a solution that enslaves the people even further than they already are,” Gunther Mauser, a German politician told Die Welt newspaper. We would go as far as saying that the engineered migration problem is not only part of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan, but also a ploy to bring out Europe’s ultimate inherent racism. The socialists of Europe are just as racist as the other side, however they veil their racism better. Socialists need someone to point their finger at, so they can rally the troops during elections, it gives them vigour and impetus. We witnessed this recently during the American midterm elections, where the American socialists and communists effectively censored and dehumanised their opposition and won many seats in Congress from the Republicans. Anyone who cares about their own home, security or family is demonised and labelled a “racist” or a “populist” by the socialists. As always, to manipulate the electorate, socialists are masters, and from history, we also saw the same technique from the National Socialists, a very legitimate branch of socialism.",1
"German Chancellor Angela Merkel is to undergo a state of the art procedure to have some form of personality and humour injected directly into her brain, Reuters has reported. The medical treatment is the latest trend amongst Germans, who sadly are devoid of any form of humour and live their lives mainly in a technical manner. Professor Arnold Weinglauss, who has performed the procedure numerous times, will officiate the process, which will take three hours of surgery time. “The procedure is rather complex, and one slip can induce a deeper state of catatonic depression which is the normal state of the Chancellor. We will infuse the ventral striatum within the temporal lobe area, and invigorate the region by injecting a dimorphic mixture of nanobots specifically designed to stimulate the humour centres.” Chancellor Merkel, like most Germans is unfortunately afflicted with an extremely morose sensibility, however after the operation she may be able to smile slightly or even say a joke. “It will take some time with such a serious case as Frau Merkel, however we may see some effects in less than two months. Instead of that milk curdling gaze, she may laugh a little. This may take her by surprise, however, and a counsellor will monitor her behaviour. We have had cases where the patient has been so surprised to crack a joke that they fell into utter depression afterwards because of their confusion. We are not however expecting Merkel to suddenly take the podium and act like a stand-up comedian, even with our technological prowess, that is a near impossibility with such a serious case as the Chancellor.” Merkel will undergo the humour injection operation in January.",1
"Theresa May’s Brexit In Name Only is a sure chance that many voters will now turn to Jeremy Corbyn and his party. The shame of Theresa May to even call her pathetic plan a Brexit is an insult to every leave voter who voted in 2016 to leave the EU. “She’s just signing a document which states that we stay in the EU indefinitely. There’s no get out clause either. In plain English it’s not a Brexit but a shameful capitulation to the EU. That’s why I’m voting for Corbyn next election and you should too. No one will trust the Tories ever again because they have been completely duplicitous and dishonest with their core voters. Never again, thanks to Theresa May will any of us vote Tory again. Better to vote for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn,” a former Conservative voter revealed today. Thousands of former Conservative voters, and Lib Dems are now opting for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Along with the youth vote, the extra numbers will get Corbyn into Number 10, Downing Street and Theresa May out. “It’s now the only way to get rid of her. Jeremy Corbyn is the only way, because the Tories can’t do it, despite her blatantly taunting Brexiteers with her lies. I’m not a socialist or a communist like Corbyn but I will vote for him, as he is the only eurosceptic left who can actually do something,” another former Tory voter revealed. Thanks to Theresa May's Brexit Betrayal Will You Now Vote For Jeremy Corbyn? Yes No View Results Jeremy Corbyn’s main reason for leaving the EU will be to bolster a firm communist state in Britain without the interference of the EU, and its ideals. “Corbyn sees the EU as a meddling money sucker. It would be better to leave the EU completely so that Britain could keep its money to spend on socialist issues, the NHS, welfare, and education. Also, Corbyn will need tonnes of money for the many nationalisations he has planned. This will take a lot of capital, especially the rail networks, nationalising utilities, and building millions of new council houses across the UK,” Labour’s chief spokesman, Mike Oxlong, told the New Statesman. No one will vote conservative for another thirty to forty years after this debacle, and quite rightly so. Britain will thus be resigned to its fate as a pseudo-communist island replete with comrades in arms marching up and down Red Trafalgar Square. It says a lot that many Brexiteers will move towards Jeremy Corbyn, who is the antithesis of everything they believe in, however there is an old saying, an enemy of my enemy is my friend. Corbyn is now the friend, and Theresa May the enemy. Viva La Revolucion!",1
"There’s something about the future that scares the shit out of people a lot, maybe it’s simply the thought of the unknown that affects us with such fear. What possible delights await us in the technological future when we are already living in a world full of burgeoning robotic tech, AI, VR, and sex robots? Forward to 2071, and you find that people have not changed much, they still have the same old foibles as we do, except with holovision. One assumes reading through the pages that this is some sort of contraption that transmits moving hologram visuals in your room, so that means the age of the television has been left in the dust, along with radio and telegrams. By 2075 we have the introduction of teledildonics, and this is not describing a floppy thingie protruding from Mark Zuckerberg’s forehead but a contraption that can excite a future date, with a bit of mutual masturbation, why not? It’s all very Black Mirror but without the enclosed claustrophobic stories, these glimpses into the future are more diary like, snippets of scenarios. Let us say an Adrian Mole of 2097. Quite astutely, the author sees the future rise of China, and we can be assured this will certainly become a reality with the Chinese Armada skirmishing with the Royal Navy across the high seas, or conducting bombing runs on Bognor Regis every other Tuesday. In 2079, John Lewis is still in Oxford Street. This came as a great fucking relief, because one can’t imagine that particular London shopping district without John Lewis. Let us hope that Hamleys is still around too, albeit selling hoverboards for the kiddies. In turn, this is a great piece of literature whizzing from one place to another, and giving the reader little insights into the possible future, some comedic, some obviously horrific in a satirical sense. Not sure if the Singularity happens at all in the duration of time in the book, but the worst part seems to be the realisation that Celebrity Big Brother still exists in 2094. Isn’t all out nuclear devastation from Russia and China preferable to CBB still being around in the future? One can only imagine. People still play cricket in 2100, and probably still munch on cucumber sandwiches during the breaks in play. This was refreshing to read like a good cuppa. Anti-ageing treatments on the NHS are obligatory by 2128? Surely that will bankrupt the already aching NHS 2.0? Well, the government ministers do debate the question, and thankfully come to their answer. Things get very interesting by 2157, especially amongst some of the Plutocrats, who are rather keen on the Ancient Egyptian civilisation. In 2060 mohawk-haired government advisers stalk the halls of Number 10 Downing Street, by that time, Tarzan Heseltine is a bag of bones deep in the ground somewhere, no doubt cursing someone who has outdone him in the hair department. This book will certainly have you turning the pages to see what happens next, isn’t that the job of a good novelist? Guy Portman no doubt seems to have fulfilled the desired effect on the reader, as you really have to turn the next page to see what wonders await, a compendium of technological prowess amongst the backdrop of human stupidity. The miniscule details, the jumping in from one language to another, and the mixing of ancient with modern adds duality to an intelligent meal of a read. Well worth the purchase. Plonk it into your collection, and you will not be disappointed by this satirical tome from an indulgent innovative author. http://guyportman.com/ Purchase your copy now: Goodreads Amazon US Amazon UK Kobo UK Barnes & Noble ",1
"All the people wanted when they voted for Brexit was to get out of the EU, and its institutions. Alas, since the EU referendum Brexit has become more of a distant mirage, and unattainable dream simply because of the establishment putting obstacles in the way of leaving the EU, and the EU putting obstacles in the way as well. Any decision now regarding Brexit is meticulously broken down and voted out, and the sad thing is, if it comes to the ideal Brexit, i.e. a Clean Brexit, that too will be voted down by the Remoaners. Against Brexit is the PM, the majority of the Remoaner Cabinet, handpicked by Remoaner PM Theresa May, the Treasury headed by Remoaner Lord Haw Haw Hammond, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, a Canadian, and 95% of the House of Lords, as well as most of the so-called Conservative party hierarchy. Other groups outside of parliament are the Soros Open Society, who fund people like Gina Miller to thwart Brexit in the High Court at any possible time, and other business people who are all on the EU gravy train and are fighting for their expense accounts. The media is now mostly anti-Brexit, with even the Daily Mail siding with Remoaners and Brussels, this is possibly due to the exit of Paul Dacre, and the instatement of Remoaner Editor Geordie Greig. The BBC, which received £5 million just before the EU referendum from the EU is naturally pro-EU, and the CBI where Theresa May spoke the other day on the benefits of her BRINO deal is completely pro-EU as it receives millions in EU money every year. As for the civil service, they are all completely pro-EU, and they control everything from behind the scenes, a la Olly Robbins. Suffice to say, the likelihood of a Brexit occurring anytime soon is about zero, and the far flung future is no better, the promises will drag on and on for years to come until everyone is so bored of it all they just elect to stay in the EU. Ultimately, this is the plan the EU and controllers in government hope for. They want people to be so jaded by the whole bureaucratic affair that they say fuck it, and leave Britain in the EU. The whole sordid Brexit affair is extremely tiresome and sickening, because it brings to light that there is little or no democracy in Britain left. We are ultimately chained now to a corrupt system of government, and the EU’s totalitarian pseudo-communist diktats permanently and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

"Black Friday is an amazing time to get those deals that you have been awaiting as a rabid consumer all year round. It’s also a great chance to buy up those Christmas presents that will wow your family members and friends. The key to finding Black Friday deals is to search online, and also attend the shops where the deals happen. If you are happy to spend four days queuing for a cut price toaster that was made in China and is just a piece of flimsy metal that will break in four weeks, then that is up to you. Our plan this year was to list as many amazing deals as we could find for our readers so you too can be first in queue and snap these amazing offers up before the rest of the suckers do. 5 Black Friday Deals That You Must Have 1 -Britlax Toaster – £7.99 from Murreys – This amazing toaster toasts your toast in less than 20 minutes, and is guaranteed to break only after 3 weeks of usage. It also burns toast to a crisp if you move the notch above 0. 2 – Xuenho Toaster – £4.99 from Tulleys – This toaster is amazing. It can toast four pieces of toast in under one minute, but you should disable your smoke alarm before using it as the flames can reach the ceiling. All in all a good toaster, but please do not put your face over it while it is in operation. Guaranteed to explode after one weeks usage. No money back or replacement guaranteed. 3 – Burnio Toaster – £12.99 from Sullies – This toaster, as the name suggests burns everything to a crisp within a five metre radius. It’s definitely top of the range Chinese engineering and will reduce your kitchen to a smoking wreck just in time for Christmas. Why not throw in the turkey for some fast cooking? 4 – LingWao Toaster – £2.99 – If you pick one of these up at a Black Friday sale, you will be the lucky owner of a magical piece of equipment. It’s cheap and dangerous. Our toaster which was sent for testing had some wires hanging out the back. When we plugged the appliance in to the mains, the whole area became live with electricity and fried our office pet. Luckily little Jimmy the Sausage dog survived the ordeal but sort of looks like a seared hot dog now. 5 – JinWong Toaster – £24.99 from Argo – This is top of the range mate. It’s like hitting the fucking jackpot four times over and still having a prize foisted on to you. I mean this toaster talks to you, it’s a new smart toaster, which analyses how many toast you want in the morning then it tells you when they are done, in Chinese. It’s a great way in learning a language while you toast. The only drawback is that the toaster is so efficient that it basically disintegrates the toast to nothing. We tried putting it on the lowest setting but still no luck.",1
"S ome people love the rush they get from watching horror films, while others completely hate it and can’t understand why anyone would choose to watch something with the intention of scaring themselves! Even though watching a horror movie the viewer knows it is isn’t real, the best horror films are still able to leave you on the edge of your seat, ready to scream, but how are they able to have this effect? When watching a film usually the motor regions of the brain are temporarily shut down, but in the case of many horror films the stimuli are so strong that it can overcome the inhibition to the motor system. The viewer then automatically jumps or screams, as an automatic reaction designed to both protect us and warn others of danger. So much so that this actually happens before we even process what has actually caused the fear. Horror films have been scaring viewers for more than a century, but it is only recently that neuroscience has been able to be used to explain the reaction in the brain whilst watching a horror. Many different elements are used within horror films with the purpose of frightening the viewer. The fear of death, which for most is the ultimate fear is often used, both in reality and psychologically. So that, the majority of horrors audiences will see at least one character reach their death. This is heightened even further, the more vile and evil the character is, like Gollum in The Hobbit franchise. The dark is often a childhood fear of many and is used within horror films to incite fear, by making the viewer wonder what is hiding or lurking in the shadows and ready to jump out. The best movies of this genre always contain elements of suspense within them. Suspense involves the creation of anticipation that something bad is about to occur, but not knowing when. Some of the most shocking scenes within horror films will create a mass of suspension, which will then end in something happening on the screen that will really shock the viewer, for example one of the main characters getting killed, usually in some gruesome manner. Music is also used often to create anticipation and fear within horror movies and it can be used to create moods and elicit emotions. It helps to amplify the feelings of shock and suspense within the viewer. Currently, horror devotees tend to agree that it is the Japanese who have discovered the right formula when it comes to horror. This breed of horror films has become really popular worldwide, but why are they so scary? Japanese horror movies really tend to focus on the psychological and suspense aspects within horror and will often heavily feature paranormal activity and also themes of exorcism, shamanism and possession. Some historical elements of Kaidan, which is Japanese folklore is also often found within these films, many of them containing stories of ghosts. It is clear to see that the elements of Japanese horror are now finding their way over to the Western movie making world, by looking at films such as Paranormal Activity, which features many of the same fear inducing traits that are familiar within Japanese horror. Therefore, we can see that many factors are utilised in the making of any horror film. The scariest and more often than not, the most successful movies, will find the perfect combination to keep audiences in a state of constant fear and anxiety. This mental state is, believe it or not, exactly what audiences are looking for and no doubt they will demand even more as time goes on.",1
"The British police have been putting their lives at risk for too long, and thankfully this is all about to change as all police officers will finally be allowed to carry firearms, and join their colleagues from every other country in the world. The amount and level of crime has increased to such a level, that it was ridiculous to suppose that police officers would attend crimes in progress armed with nothing other than a puny truncheon and a pair of handcuffs. “Criminals these days carry an assortment of weapons from machetes to AK-47s. You would get a policeman arriving at a crime scene, and he would be faced with thugs running at him armed to the teeth while he gets his little truncheon out and is tasked in taking down these criminals. If the policeman gets away alive or is not seriously injured, then it’s a miracle,” Superintendent DCI Kevin Plodder, told the BBC. The new government white paper outlining the arming of every policeman in Britain will be published in full next week. There will also be a 60,000 increase in officers by 2020, and a budget increase of 75%. Routine stop and search will be conducted in areas where crime is prevalent. “A policeman or woman has a right to defend themselves from heavily armed criminals. This is why our police will now be trained and armed in firearms,” a member of the policy team announced on Tuesday. What kind of firearms will the police now be trained and armed with? Each squad car will be equipped with an assortment of weapons including pump action shotguns, automatic weapons and tasers. All police will routinely be equipped with handguns and tasers whilst on patrol. “The level of crime is at such a level at the moment that our rules of engagement will be upgraded to shoot to kill. Our officers will also be protected from prosecution and most cases will be accepted by the courts as just proportionate action,” police spokesman, Andy Grenville, added. Recent polling has shown that arming all police officers in Britain has received a positive response with 85% approval rating.",1
"Not content with betraying the nation with a contractual debacle that will tie Britain into certain slavery for eternity with the EU, this barren witch with a coal black womb, does not have much heart either, as it is black as well. Sitting in her den, her cauldron boils over with many insidious ingredients, as she stirs the vast pot bubbling with vicious plans for the future. “My masters, I have vowed treachery upon those in Britain, they must be punished, my masters tell me every day, it must be done at any cost. There are many now trying to stop me seeing through their plan, and my masters have given me the green light to achieve the goal of imprisoning Britain forever in the EU. Whether tis to ruin the Conservative party, that is no consequence to me or my masters, because we only care for one thing. Yes-s-s, to push through the plan, to sign the contract, as it was scribed by my masters, I have to get this through. (the witch pauses to throw a live frog into the boiling cauldron) I am bolstered from the top, and these mice of men below in the backbenches are nothing to me, and they will fail miserably as our power of evil is too great. There is nothing they can do.” The witch rubs her belly, for she wishes to punish the whole country for her state of barrenness. “All these vile people in Britain who can have children. Not I, my blackened diseased womb, is the same as Merkel’s, for this we are sisters in inequity, in shameful detestation of everything that is good, like the right to self-determination, sovereignty and national borders, where the little kiddies can run around happy in their playgrounds. We can only look at those little pattering feet and feel disdain, avarice and extreme jealousy.” As the Number 10 cat saunters into the den where the witch is working, it suddenly realises its mistake and tries to make a run for it. “Not too fast me dearie, hmm, the cauldron needs some more ingredients. Cat, cat, felix, fluffy one, into the cauldron of doom you go, with the people of Britain, and all things that are good like freedom, liberty, and sovereignty, to your doom, doom you go, just like my blackened womb, to doom you must go! (the witch tosses the squealing cat into the cauldron)",1
"It’s NOT a Brexit, so we will not call it one. What Theresa May is touting is a total surrender to the EU, and she wants us to pay £39 billion of taxpayers money for the pleasure. EMERGENCY BROADCAST We need urgency right now. This is no time to mince about and twiddle thumbs, or to think about it, we need action right now. The Conservative MPs who are enabling Theresa May in her surrender betrayal are disgusting sycophants and remainers. twitter The others currently in the Cabinet must seriously think about what they are doing. They are enabling a surrender to the EU proposed by Michel Barnier and Theresa May. If you do not find the right path and resign from May’s Cabinet, you are complicit in her treachery. Conservative MPs must back the no confidence vote, because Theresa May is the problem, and if she does not go, and go soon, there will be more turmoil for many years to come. Her proposal will condemn Britain to thirty years of riots and political turmoil, with no one ever trusting the Tories ever again. If you are a Conservative MP, you are implored to do the right thing and support May’s ousting. For the good of the country and its future, it is imperative that she is either made to resign or forcibly resigned from her post. There is no hope for Theresa May, and we have asserted numerous times that she is the Chequers deal and it is her, but no one listened then, even though MPs are waking up now to her complicit methods of pushing her surrender through parliament. This is an emergency, and MPs must act now, decisively with haste, but it must be measured haste of course, as timing counts as well. There is no way that something as bad as this deal should ever be allowed anywhere near a signature. Time is running out. Please read this and act now. For the good of the country, you can make a difference in parliament if you are a Conservative MP who cares about their country. Please spread these words far and wide, as every tick of the clock is a moment lost in action to save the nation. Write to your MP, call their offices, go and see them at your constituency surgeries. DO IT! UPDATE 17/11/18: There is news that some action is being taken, but whether it will come to anything positive is another story. aut neca aut necare",1
"As the Daily Squib’s political correspondent, I was privileged to be given access to Theresa May at Number 10, Downing Street. This is a time of great crisis for the Prime Minister, who is trying to sell her ‘Brexit’ deal to the parliament and country. DS: Prime minister May, thank you kindly for granting us access, especially in this time of turmoil and political chaos. TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control. DS: How can we get out of the customs union when there is a clause tying the UK to the EU permanently? Even your attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, warned you and the cabinet that this will be nigh on impossible to get out of, and even if the UK tries to get out of it, it will take decades of lawyers working day and night at huge cost to the country. Not only that, you have conceded to pay the EU £39 billion for the pleasure of imprisonment and nothing else to show for it. TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control. DS. Do you think it was right for a Remainer to try to conduct a Brexit? Most of the Cabinet are Remainers, and most of the civil service, Treasury and Bank of England. Your deal looks like it is a remain document as opposed to a Brexit document. In other words, everything is geared towards appeasing the EU with massive capitulations making the UK into a vassal state with no say or get out clause. TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control. DS: How do you respond to the mass ministerial resignations from the party and your cabinet in protest at the deal you have presented? TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control. DS: You keep saying that but the document says otherwise. Why do you say one thing when you are presenting something completely different? This document keeps the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. Why are you lying? Are you going to give a free vote on this draft to parliament Mrs May? Please answer the questions, Mrs May. TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the customs union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fisheries policy and to take back control (frothing at the mouth). DS: Are you okay Mrs. May (concerned)? TM: Error syntax error (zzzzzst) compilation error (sparks flying) Trying to reboot (tsssssssszzzk) run time error (smoke coming from ears) logic overload motherboard error! (zzzzzst) shut down! shut down! Number 10 technicians in white coats immediately rush in with an assortment of screwdrivers, pliers and cranks. They try to repair Mrs May, who at one point tries dancing but her leg falls off. I bid my farewell, and flee Downing Street, traumatised by what I have witnessed.",1
"I n the 2018 Epica Awards there were Grand Prix winners from the United States, Italy, Ireland, Germany and Japan. • Network of the Year: McCann Worldgroup • Agency of the Year: Forsman & Bodenfors • Production Company of the Year: Blur Films GRAND PRIX • RESPONSIBILITY: “Price On Our Lives”, March For Our Lives, McCann NY • ALTERNATIVE: “Go With the Fake”, Diesel, Publicis Italy • DESIGN: “LA Original”, Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles, 72andSunny • DIGITAL: “JFK Unsilenced”,The Times News UK & Ireland, Rothco/Accenture Interactive • PRINT: “Highlight the Remarkable”, Stabilo, DDB Group Germany (Berlin) • FILM: “The Party Bus”, Shiseido Summing up the awards, jury President Tony Chambers, former editor-in-chief and creative director of Wallpaper*, who recently launched his own consultancy TC&Friends, said: “I was astonished by the overall quality of the work, as well as the innovation and wit on offer. There were strong contenders in each category and it was always hard to choose one clear winner.” The new Responsibility Grand Prix for cause-related work went to “Price On Our Lives” from McCann Worldgroup in New York. The campaign allowed the students of America to protest against gun violence with a potent symbol: the price of their lives as calculated by the amount of money the NRA donates to politicians, divided by the total number of students. The price tag amounted to little more than a dollar. Commenting on the win – and its Network of the Year prize – Rob Reilly, Global Creative Chairman, McCann Worldgroup, said, “Winning awards is never the motivation, but rather, the by-product of doing the right thing for our client’s business. A big shout out to all of the MWG employees for always going for it, never giving up and making our brand partners wildly successful.” The Alternative Grand Prix, also a new prize, went to Publicis Italy and Diesel for a campaign that struck back against counterfeit fashion. Diesel created its own rip-off brand, “DEISEL”, and sold it in a shabby New York pop-up store during fashion week, before revealing that, yes, the clothes really were authentic – only the label was wrong. Plus, this was a limited edition. Cue lines around the block and lots of buzz about Diesel. The Digital Grand Prix was won by Rothco/Accenture Interactive for “JFK Unsilenced”, a project for The Times. It used digital technology to recreate the speech John F. Kennedy would have given at the Dallas Trade Mart had he not been killed by an assassin’s bullet on November 22 1963. The almost perfect voice of JFK, giving the speech he was never able to make, gives listeners chills. Jill Byrne, Director of Marketing for Rothco, said: “It’s a huge endorsement for us that the journalists working for marketing and communications magazines around the world have recognised our work for The Times and awarded it the prestigious Grand Prix.” DDB Germany won the Print Grand Prix with “Highlight the Remarkable”. The campaign for Stabilo highlighter pens literally “highlighted” talented women who had been neglected by history and forced to stand in the shadow of their male counterparts. In a joint statement the agency commented: “The whole team is excited that this campaign has been recognised with an honor at Epica Awards! It truly adds a new facet to highlighting the remarkable.” The Design Grand Prix went to 72andSunny, which created a new and dynamic identity for the multifaceted city of L.A. on behalf of the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles. 72andSunny’s Executive Strategy Director and Partner Kelly Schoeffel said: “It was an honor to brand Los Angeles in the midst of a creative renaissance – from tech to entertainment to manufacturing. Our first-ever civic identity system celebrates the diverse community while supporting and funding local creativity.” The Film Grand Prix was won by Shiseido in-house for its quirky and poetic film “The Party Bus”, which combines animation, special effects and drama to tell a contemporary fairy tale. The 3D animation required close to 2000 stop motion shots. Shiseido creative director Masato Kosukegawa said: “I would like to thank Shou Yanagisawa, the director, and all the artists who worked with us, for their precise and inspired craft. ‘The Party Bus’ was made to expand Shiseido’s reach to young people. We thought a lot about what we could do with makeup in this confused and divided world. In the end we arrived at the concept that makeup can be courageous, and that doing your makeup your own way brings self-confidence. This led us to touch on the topic of LGBT. In Japanese culture there is a strong conservative tendency, and stories of LGBT are not commonly told yet. I think this film was probably the first work by a major Japanese company to address LGBT in an advertisement.” Humour Category In the humour category, the Daily Squib’s favourite choice won the gold award, “Smart House” by entrant TRY, which displayed a hilarious satire on modern technology and its good/bad points. Another highlight was the short but straight to the point ad “Shit in Space” suffice to say, there is something quite endearing about Norwegian humour and the creatives, producers at TRY agency in Norway. Runners up in the humour section were: “Comic Relief Safety Video” by 2AM, “safer snaxxx” by BBDO Group Germany, “Alexa Loses Her Voice” by Lucky Generals, “Now or Never” by FP7/CAI. Entrants & Entries by Country This year Epica received 4020 entries from 69 countries, a 20% increase on the previous year despite difficult market conditions. This was driven by the return of the Publicis Groupe networks, plus an enthusiastic response from Germany and Latin America. Indeed, the highest number of entries came from Germany, followed by the United States and France. New countries this year included Iran and Morocco. In terms of networks, BBDO and McCann Worldgroup were particularly well represented. Results by Country France was top in the country rankings with 53 awards including 12 golds. You will find full details of all the winners on our website at www.epica-awards.com Founded 31 years ago, Epica is the only worldwide creative award judged by journalists from the marketing, design and advertising press, as well as specialist reporters in fields ranging from production to VR and luxury branding.",1
"Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knackers yard BRINO PM Theresa May has appointed a Remain minister to be in charge of remaining in the EU. “I have dispensed with Brexit ministers, that’s two of them to be precise. Instead of a Brexit minister, I have decided to appoint a Remain minister, because it falls more in line with my BRINO Chequers deal. No, I will not take anymore comments thank you,” the PM hurriedly announced this morning. What will the Remain minister’s duties involve? Olly Robbins, kindly explained the role of the Remain minister to waiting press outside Number 10 Downing Street. “As chief Remain operative, we had no qualms about ignoring our previous Brexit ministers, so we are dispensing with the whole Brexit thing anyway due to our remain stance and the cleverly worded dossier we presented to the people that explains why we will remain in the EU. Brexit actually means Remain. Just thought I might reiterate that point. For every step out of the EU, we are assuring the UK makes four steps back into the EU.” The Remain Minister, will start work immediately, first by simply reading Theresa May’s BRINO deal and explaining to reporters why leaving the EU means remaining in the EU.",1
"Perpetually offended Social Justice Warrior, and keen activist in all socialist matters, ranging from LGBTQP affairs, feminism, no borders, soviet ideology, marxism, and the ideal communist state, Hugh Mungus, is in a state of perpetual offence. “I wake up in the morning and the first thing I hear are the words, ‘good morning’ and I shout to my roommate that this is a form of racist linguistic capitalist imperialist sexist white-male created offensive greeting that assumes it is a good morning in our Western capitalist bourgeois society when there are people in Africa NOT having a good morning. They are having a shit morning because they live in a corrugated iron shack and have to walk for five hours to fill a bucket full of dirty muddy water to fucking drink from.” Mr. Mungus, who attends Berkeley college in California is so outraged that he now deems all society, biology and science offensive as well as the concept of being offended as offensive. “I am outraged and offended at offence. It is offensive and hateful to be in this perpetual state and the concept of being offended is offending. Being offended in itself is an offensive stance to the state of offence and offending. Being offended is no doubt in my mind a creation of the capitalist racist sexist system which imprisons people to be offended and I suspect they created offence in the first place. Everything is offensive to me, as I am perpetually in a state of offence and it is my right to be offended at the concept of being offended and offence in an offensive manner.” ",1
"Thar she goes..the leaky ship BRINO is sinking fast, with resignations galore, some have jumped into the lifeboats, Northern Island minister, 2 x Brexit ministers, BoJo, Esther McVey plus all the rest. Mrs May is sticking to her guns though on her ship called BRINO. As each gloating EU iceberg slams into the side, she stays stalwart and says everything is okay. “There is nothing to see here. There is no danger. The ship BRINO may be taking on gallons of freezing water through the torn hull, the violins are still playing, and I am still dancing on the deck, even though we are now lopping port side at 35 degrees.” As for the crew of the ship that are still onboard BRINO, they are vehemently promised by Captain May that there is nothing to fear, and that everything is fine. “Mrs May told us that it’s ok and even though I am now hanging from a flagpole and the ship is making these rather unsavoury gurgling noises as the water is pushing through, I am committed to believing Captain May that there is nothing to worry about..Aaaaargh! (falls 200 feet to their death)” This time however, there will be no Celine Dion soundtrack.",1
"Today we have another announcement that the Brexit deal will be completed in the next 48 hrs, much like the previous 48 hrs, and the 48 hrs before that. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, must be so bored of having to announce a deal being made every 48 hrs for the last few months. “I get the call from Olly Robbins, to make another 48 hrs announcement, then after another 48 hrs passes, I get another call to do the same thing. Frankly, I’m getting rather bored of it. This BRINO stage managed fiasco really is smarting. I have better things to do.” Of course, we all know the plan is one of stalling things for as long as possible, in order to push the “Brexit In Name Only” Chequers deal through parliament as a matter of urgency towards the end of some deadline made by Brussels. Hopefully the good ol’ boys and gals will be there to vote the fucker down as soon as it finally rears its ugly head. Coincidentally 48 hrs was a great movie from 1982 starring Nick Nolte, and a young Eddie Murphy. The bit that really sticks in the memory is the moment Eddie is in his jail cell singing Roxanne by the Police. This was truly a wonderful cinematic and comedic scene. Nolte plays a hard edged cop who enlists Murphy, a convict, to find a killer in less than 48 hours, or it’s jail time for Reggie. At the time, it was a typical cliche black and white buddy movie, with the usual love and hate politics. Great film. Watch it if you ever missed it or were not born then.",1
"“We have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked but not combined. We are interested and associated but not absorbed. If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, she must always choose the open sea.” Winston Churchill Are these not the same Brexit shores that bred men to storm the beaches of Normandy, to fight against hordes of Vikings, to win against all odds against Napoleon, to conquer half of the world with one of the greatest empires ever known? No Deal Better Than Bad Deal You would certainly not think it from the Theresa May crew, who shrivel and kowtow to every Brussels belch. Who have constrained Britain and left it a whimpering bitch on the end of a leash. What did those men and women die for in two world wars? It certainly was not to be a subservient nation unable to make its own laws, unable to make its own trade deals, and unable to GET SOME FUCKING BOLLOCKS! We voted on June 23, 2016 in a democratic referendum to leave the Customs Union, leave the ECJ, leave the single market, and ultimately leave the EU — COMPLETELY! No half measures, no half foot in half out, none of that. The EU referendum result was promised that it would be solidly binding and respected by parliament, and not meddled with. This promise was of course made because the Remain side was projected to win. When the result was Leave, this was obviously a different story and democracy flew out of the window. It seems there is no belief anymore in Britain, a land that has much illustrious historic value, and has been the bastion of adversity for thousands of years. We’re not fucking surrender monkeys that roll over like the others, those wet farts who initially disagreed to an EU referendum question, but were ordered by their EU masters to have another one until they got the answer Brussels wanted. (France, Ireland, Netherlands) Clean No Deal Brexit Britain’s future will be one of great riches and sovereign greatness, if it leaves without a deal. Its people and parliamentarians can hold their heads up high, and they can forge their own trade deals, they can fish in their own waters, they can make their own laws once again. We must embrace freedom. Yes, it is going to be tough, but better to live one day as a lion than 100 as a sheep. We must move forward, clean no deal Brexit. Let the EU dwaddle on that one, let them eat their own rotten cake, for it is they who have reneged, backstabbed, and wriggled like worms in the so-called ‘negotiations’. It is time to stand up. Now!",1
"The technique the organisers of the migrant caravan will utilise to offset any military presence at the U.S. border will be to push the women and children to the front, almost as a human shield, and to also display them to the world’s press who will be filming them. This method is utilised as a means to shame the military, because they will be facing off to thousands of women and children. This will also engender feelings of sadness amongst viewers and pity. The Mexican authorities have repeatedly promised the migrant caravan people homes, benefits, schooling and safety, but none of the participants of the caravan have taken up the offer, even though many are claiming they are pursuing safety and asylum. They instead only talk about going to America. The organisers of the migrant caravan, are funded by many organisations, mostly socialist and communist, inadvertently funded by US taxpayers through shell charity organisations, and those linked to George Soros. In Guatemala, 11 Cuban nationals were detained, and many in the caravan are from far flung spots like Bangladesh, Congo and other Asian countries. It is a certainty that the migrant caravan was planned over a year ago. This can be ascertained by the immense logistical operation, where food and rest stops along the route have all been meticulously laid out. Transport, and even payment to the participants of the caravan to continue their journey, some paid over $1,000 each for the trek by leftist groups. These poor people are effectively pawns of the leftist groups who are manipulating them purely as a political agenda to undermine Donald Trump and America. This despicable act is a human tragedy and the organisations who have been implicit in organising this should have their US affiliates shut down by the Trump organisation and their funds seized. One cannot be sure of the response by the Trump administration when the migrant caravan hits the border, but if he backs down he will be viewed as weak, if he acts aggressively, then he will cause outrage amongst the leftists and communists within the United States. This is a very fine tightrope the president now finds himself on. What will he do to get out of this calamity foisted on him and the country? How will all of this end? Could this topple Trump and his bid for 2020 reelection? Break out the popcorn and Schlitz and keep watching.",1
"Time is running out, according to a global think tank, Strategic Universal Coalition Kraft, who determine that the acceleration of military might in Russia and China is outclassing anything that is happening in the West. “Russia recently unveiled a hypersonic ‘glider’ called Avangard, active under the Red Banner Missile Division, which is based in the south Urals. This terrifying weapon travels at 20 at times the speed of sound, is invulnerable to any air defences, and can strike a target anywhere on Earth ‘like a meteorite’, according to Vladimir Putin. “Russia’s ‘Satan II’ missile can carry up to 24 Avangards, which means one fully-loaded nuke would have enough firepower to wipe out all the major cities in the UK in one fell swoop. “China is developing a satellite system that can spot submarines at a depth of 500 metres which would render most fleets of Western nuclear submarines redundant and traceable. “Project Guanlan, meaning “watching the big waves”, was officially launched in May at the Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, Shandong. Song Xiaoquan, a researcher involved in the project, said if the team can develop the satellite as planned, it will make the upper layer of the sea “more or less transparent”. “The device is designed to generate high-power laser beam pulses in different colours, or frequencies, that allow sensitive receivers to pick up more information from various depths. Those laser beams can scan an area as wide as 100km, or concentrate on one spot just 1km wide. It will be used in conjunction with a microwave radar, also mounted on the satellite, to better identify targets. Although the radar cannot penetrate water, it can measure the surface movement with extremely high accuracy – so when a moving submarine creates small disturbances on the surface, the radar will tell the satellite where to throw the laser beam. “These are just a few examples of a myriad of programmes that have already been developed and are being implemented as well as programmes in current development threatening the UK, and its NATO allies. “While other nations are spending on military hardware and upgrading their systems, the UK is falling by the side. The Ministry of Defence faces a £15 billion shortfall in its budget for the next ten years, and is barely functioning as of right now. “The National Audit Office said that the MoD’s equipment plan – used to fund military hardware including combat aircraft and submarines – “remains unaffordable”, with the department itself forecasting a £7bn gap between now and 2028. “The situation is deteriorating to such a level that the MoD is currently considering whether to pause a raft of big projects under the Modernising Defence Programme launched by ministers earlier this year. “This disgraceful negligence by current and past governments puts the UK in considerable risk not only now, but in the future. If it does not remedy these gaps in funding, and increase spending immediately, Britain will be a sitting duck in any future conflict. “Not only should the government increase military spending by at least 60%, it must also implement a national program for all citizens of compulsory military service, healthy males 17 to 21 years old will serve in the armed forces for 18 months. Compulsory conscription during peace time is a necessary preparation for future conflict coming soon. “The UK, must also expand its military preparations and increase cooperation with its allies, as they will be needed to bolster our defences when the conflict begins. “The UK must increase its army of hackers, because the conflict will most probably start with a massive cyber attack, which will seek to shut down Britain’s infrastructure, power, water, and transport. GCHQ must receive an increase of funding that will enable it to counteract an immense coordinated cyber attack. “If nothing is done now, it will be too late when the conflict commences. There will be little or no time to react with any purposeful force.” http://www.army.mod.uk/join/ http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/how-to-join https://www.raf.mod.uk/recruitment/ http://www.army.mod.uk/specialforces/30603.aspx http://www.army.mod.uk/intelligence/intelligence.aspx",1
"That’s the question clients, agencies and journalists will be asking at the Epica Awards Creative Circle, which will take place in Amsterdam on November 15. The setting is the magnificent KIT Royal Tropical Institute, one of the city’s most remarkable buildings. Taking part in a series of exclusive round table conversations are ABN Amro, KPN, Nuon, Philips and PWC. The agency side is represented by BETC, Cheil, DDB, Superheroes, We Are Social and Wieden + Kennedy. They are joined by journalists from titles such as Adweek, Adformatie, and Werben & Verkaufen. The industry is embodied by opinion leaders from the EASA (European Advertising Standards Alliance), the IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau), the DDA (Dutch Digital Agencies) and the VEA (the association of Dutch communications consultants). Issues such as gender equality, sexuality, diversity, political extremism and climate change are impossible to ignore yet fraught with risks for communicators. When does purpose-driven advertising becoming “cause washing”? Is it still possible to create controversial or even non-politically correct campaigns? Our thoughts on this matter is that political correctness has come to such a level of censorship now that it is nigh on impossible to create anything edgy or humourous without offending someone who stirs up a stink and then gets you canned. Within the advertising world, it is now a serious no no to offend, because to some people everything is now offensive, and there are massive client budgets on the line. This is a symptom of years of social programming of soviet-style group think, which has leached out onto the mainstream media, and the advertising world. The media will no doubt report on the event’s key findings. Students from the New School Amsterdam will also be present at the event, which is backed by partners Adobe, Euronews, Screenvision and the EASA. Meanwhile, there are still places available for the Epica Awards ceremony itself, from 7pm on November 14, when the Royal Tropical Institute will become the stage for a celebration of the world’s best creative work, as voted by the unique press jury of the Editors’ and Publishers’ International Creative Awards.

By backing to win, you’ll be able to take the strongest price from your chosen horse winning.

All you need to do is look into the horse you’re considering betting on, checking how capable they are in winning the race you’re backing them to finish first in. Another factor is how capable other horses in the race are, especially in the instance where it turns out that there’s another horse that holds a stronger record in the type of race you’re placing money on.",1
"A t the end of the 2014 Premier League season, Manchester City topped the division, with Liverpool and Chelsea just behind, Spurs and Arsenal fought it out for fourth place and Manchester United struggled, finishing outside the Champions League spots. Sound familiar? Today in the Premier League, City sit on top, with the other five clubs placed in the same positions outlined above. Similar narratives can be told for the top leagues in Spain, Germany, France and Italy. Frankly, it can feel a bit like watching the same actors in movies all over again. Sure, someone like Leicester City, who shocked the world in 2016 with their unlikely title victory, can have a ‘guest star’ role, but those seem to be fleeting and increasingly rare. Unpredictability does not always equate to excitement, as sometimes unpredictability points to a lack of quality. However, the two do overlap, and one of the best leagues to see it happen is in the EFL Championship. Premier League money lifts relegated clubs The Championship is in a unique position of Europe’s lower leagues. Many clubs are propped up by the largess of the Premier League, receiving parachute payments over four years after relegation from the top flight. For example, last season Hull City, Sunderland and Middlesbrough each received £40 million from the Premier League as a result of relegation in the 2016/17 season. In Deloitte’s rankings of football clubs, current Championship sides West Brom and Stoke City have bigger operating revenues than top European clubs like Marseille, Lazio and several clubs competing in the Champions League. Of course, the Championship does not have the quality of the Premier League, nor does it always deliver the thrilling, skilful football fans demand. But, on a whole, the league enthrals fans, as exciting stars, such as Jack Grealish, Tammy Abraham and Yannick Bolasie, mix it up with the “blood and thunder” journeymen. The beauty of the league, however, has always lay in the fact that the big clubs, those who have entered the division with Premier League-quality squads, have always been hit with a rude awakening. Look at Aston Villa, Stoke and Swansea; all expected to return to the top flight as a consequence of having top squads, and finding themselves firmly in mid-table. Rich clubs not always betting favourites Indeed, the Championship betting markets favour clubs like Leeds United (7/2, Bet365) and Sheffield United (11/2), neither of whom have been in the Premier League for several years. However, that sense of unpredictability can also reward punters. Aston Villa, who boast an excellent squad, can be found at 33/1 to win the division, Stoke and Swansea at 40/1 and 66/1 respectively. Observers of the division will tell you: rule nobody out. The Championship is also furnished with decent television coverage, not usually afforded to other lower leagues around Europe. However, it is the crowds on matchday that really show how popular the league is. Consider that the Championship was recently ranked as Europe’s third most attended league in Europe, averaging 11,086368 in 2016/17. That’s bigger than La Liga, Serie A and France’s Ligue 1. Incredible. Finally, there are some intangible elements to the Championship that also elicit excitement from football fans, namely the stature and history of the clubs in the division: Table-toppers Leeds, one of the biggest clubs in English football history. Nottingham Forest, an intriguing long-shot bet at 25/1 to win the league, the club of Brian Clough and European Cup glory. Others, like Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers, have all played a role in shaping the nature of English football over the decades. Seeing these clubs struggle and then finally break the bonds to reward fans can be a joy to behold. Long may it continue.",1
"The inside of a sprayer plane that seeds chemtrails into the atmosphere The report, published in the Population Science Journal, followed trends in every country from 1950 to 2017 and found a rapid decline in fertility that has not been a surprise to scientists. “If one takes into account that in the West, the high usage of plastics, especially in supermarkets, and in food production, as well as chemicals like Bisphenol A which are put into bottled water and tin cans, as well as the myriad of chemicals put into food, hormones in meat, fertilizers and poisons in fruit/vegetables, vaccinations, wifi, cell phone radiation, GMO food, and the daily spraying of the skies by specialist aeroplanes, then there is absolutely no surprise that fertility rates have fallen in developed nations,” a scientist commented about the fall in fertility. Chemtrails are different to regular contrails left by passenger jets which dissipate almost immediately. Chemtrails are thick chemical laden deposits pumped out by specialist jets which criss cross the skies spraying the atmosphere. If one watches chemtrail seeding, the process is very slow as the streams of chemicals keep their linear form for awhile then morph into a cloud eventually falling to earth distributing the chemicals far and wide over a large area. It is not known what composes the chemicals that fall on to the populations and surrounding countryside below, however the statistics of a fall in fertility and vast rises in cancer since the 1950s do give an indication. There is, as of yet, no official explanation for spraying the skies with thick chemicals which fall onto the earth. One must understand that this spraying has been going on for decades, and is vehemently denied to even exist. Many people are too engrossed in their mobile phones or their lives to even look up into the sky these days, and many are asleep to what is happening around them. Western nations, and those above government, are killing their populations off with mass produced shit food, chemicals, and factory farming as well as the societal decline of the family from years of feminism. In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year compared to the fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average. As developing and third world nations advance their countries economically, they too will be targeted. The acceleration of infertility, cancer and other illnesses which are a symptom of developed first world nations, will soon encompass the whole globe resulting in an overall reduction in population.",1
"Feminism is now in its last death throes and many are welcoming a dawning of a new age, where free love reigns and puritanism is resigned to history. Professor Jonah Collins, at the University of Wichita, revealed the intricacies of the sudden change in mood. “When you have an age of puritan, politically correct, sexless boredom, people eventually have enough. You can’t pit the sexes against each other forever, eventually love wins through. This is what we’re seeing with the latest data. People want to have fun again, be happy, have lots of sex, and forget about the Marxist social justice warriors trying to indoctrinate them to hate the other sex.” Instead of hating, would it not be better for feminists to love? Gina Munche, a former feminist used to hate men but has seen the error of her ways. “I had been indoctrinated to hate men. Through school to university, that is all we were taught. Day in day out. I used to be an activist saying that all men should die and be killed, but one day I was walking home and tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I busted my head bad, and many women walked away. Then one guy he knelt down to help me. At first I was about to say I didn’t need no man’s help, but he went and pulled me up, and called an ambulance as I was cut up pretty bad. This guy didn’t ask for anything, he helped me in the ambulance and assured me that I would be okay. That’s the last I saw him. From then on, I know that all men ain’t bad. All men don’t want to rape women.” Since that moment Gina threw off her SJW anti-male activist hat and instead embraced men. These are some of the reasons many women who were previously indoctrinated in the soviet-style feminism and third wave are seeing that love is the true force of the universe, and not hatred. Men are no better than women, and vice versa, and we are all here for a specific reason, as the natural biological function requires.",1
"London school, Stabbington Primary has been shut down today because there have not been enough stabbings this month. There have been sporadic incidents of children refusing to carry knives or participate in frenzied stabbing sessions down the local chippy near the school. “Education Secretary, Ron Shank, was down here last week and he disapproved of the low number of mass stabbings that go on on a daily basis. He said that we are well down in the Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan’s stab league and we should therefore get more funding to buy more knives for our school this year from central government,” Headmaster of Stabbington Primary in Tulse Hill, South London, told the BBC. These certainly are worrying times for the Labour mayor who for two years has put all his efforts into producing a sub-class of feral children that are terrorising the general population and encouraging a climate of perpetual fear. The Labour mayor has refused any responsibility in the deterioration of attacks and urges more to be done, like decreasing police numbers further. Stab Britain Young boys especially in deprived areas of London are being ostracised for not carrying enough knives to school or participating in stabbings. Yesterday, in Prime Minister’s questions, Home Secretary Sajid Javid put forward a plan to integrate more children into the stabbing culture: “Children who have grown up in the London areas where stabbing numbers have dropped significantly must be transferred to areas where the London mayor still has not implemented a halt to police presence. We are doing our best to reduce police numbers, and I have ordered police to concentrate their resources to prosecuting Twitter hate crimes.” Since the Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan has been in power, he has reduced the number of police on the streets and has made a concerted effort to encourage violent crime so that normal citizens have to live in perpetual fear of death. Under Sadiq Khan’s Labour mayorship London is now a crime ridden bloodbath where wild rat feral children happily celebrate their tenth birthday with a stabbing or two thus pleasing their friends, and it seems the current mayor’s office.",1
"Similar to the Las Vegas shooting where 58 Country music fans were shot to death after Trump had been inaugurated as president, this latest shooting at a Country music bar holds a similar pattern. This sad terrible episode at the Borderline Bar and Grill, is positively another provocation, and we may soon see an escalation of politically motivated killings occur in America. The timing of the shooting just after the midterm election, and the recent firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions does suggest there is political motive, especially within such a polarised country. One minute you might be innocently line dancing, the next, you could be on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds. It seems that Country music is in line with a firm death sentence if you live in America. Provocations like this shooting usually escalate, and there is even a chance of civil war erupting soon enough, especially as there are so many people in America who are mentally ill and gun owners.

MAD KING & HIS HANDLERS GO BYE BYE https:// twitter.com/jeffmueller/st atus/826920269491085317 … 9,017 11:41 PM - Feb 1, 2017 Twitter Ads info and privacy 16.8K people are talking about this The rhetoric used by socialist Marxist Hollywood celebrities urge people to take action in any way possible, and it is to this end that some unhinged individuals will take their words literally. The same goes for democrat politicians like Maxine Waters who has urged violent opposition on any Trump supporters and those who work in the White House. Is this open season on Trump, especially after the massive win of Senators in the recent Midterm elections? The likelihood and probability to that question is, yes. There are already groups like Antifa who freely discuss murdering conservative supporters on Twitter. These individuals and groups are given carte blanche and freedom to plan their missions without any censorship or banning because they are left-wing. There could also be a backlash from other groups, the mid-American military militias, who feel that they are under attack by the mainstream leftist media. The tables have strangely twisted around, where the socialist democrats are now the aggressors and acting like Nazis, when they claim they are fighting the very same thing. Banning guns in America will not solve anything either because they will just go underground, and many will die defending their right to own arms. If any administration ever tries to ban guns, there will most definitely be a civil war. Naturally, the motive of this heinous act will probably be watered down, so as not to inflame tensions between the two political sides fighting each other by the authorities, however they should be honest with citizens and not cover anything up. Why not tell the truth once in awhile, it would be refreshing?",1
"After much cogitation and deliberation, the Epica jury have come up with a shortlist of stellar examples of prowess within the advertising field. This year has been challenging because not only has there been a 20% increase in entries but the quality of entries despite the current market conditions has been outstanding. The Daily Squib jurors thoroughly enjoyed judging the Epica competition entries, and we are truly humbled and honoured to be part of this process. Here is a pdf of the shortlisted entries for 2018 ordered by country. These finalists will now go through to the final Jury meeting in Amsterdam from November 12-14. Gold and Grand Prix winners will be awarded during a ceremony at the KIT Royal Tropical Institute on the evening of November 15. The Epica jury is composed of editors and senior reporters from the world’s leading magazines covering creativity and communications. They are supported by an online jury of 300 journalists from specialist titles in fields such as post-production, VR, design, luxury and fashion. This year, Epica received 4020 entries from 69 countries, a 20% increase on the previous year despite difficult market conditions. This was driven by the return of the Publicis Groupe networks, plus an enthusiastic response from Germany and Latin America. Indeed, the highest number of entries came from Germany, followed by the United States and France. New countries this year included Iran and Morocco. In terms of networks, BBDO and McCann Worldgroup were particularly well represented. Congratulations to all the shortlisted entrants. Agencies who entered work that did not make it onto the shortlist should bear in mind that selected noteworthy entries are also featured in our annual Epica Book, giving each piece of work an additional chance to shine. The book, curated by Epica founder and author Mark Tungate, will be released in September 2019. We wish you the best of luck in the next stage of the competition.",1
"You could hear a pin drop amongst the #MeToo movement last night when a female White House microphone handler was assaulted by a rabid CNN reporter, called Jim Acosta. “If the female intern was a liberal, there would have been a great uproar, and the #MeToo movement would have voiced their outrage at the blatant assault, however because she was working in a Republican White House, there was only silence. Suffice to say, it is okay to assault conservative women but not socialist women,” a shocked observer of the whole sorry affair remarked. Jim Acosta, is not only known for his unsubtle methods, but his brutish questions, and his behaviour towards women it seems. “She was just trying to do her job, her beautiful immaculate hair, her pristine smooth porcelain skin, one assumes she is barely over the age of 21. Who is this temptress who gripped the microphone so tightly, her perfectly manicured slender fingers held on for as long as she could, but was brutally assaulted in plain sight by this horrible man who calls himself a reporter? She awkwardly stood back, yet still held her womanly poise, a startled Bambi in the woods, and then eventually she took the mic and handed it to the NBC correspondent. If Bill Clinton had viewed this debacle, he too would have been stirred by this beautiful intern struggling with all her strength to keep her hand on the microphone. For a start, she is miles better looking than Monica, has a great grip, and has the ability to kneel down with such demure prowess,” a White House observer revealed yesterday. It is quite right that Jim Acosta, the accoster of the unimaginably hot female intern mic holder should be barred from the White House for his ungentlemanly violent conduct, but still, it is a disgusting detriment to the so-called #MeToo movement that there has been nothing but silence to what happened to this poor woman just trying to do her job in the White House. Last night was proof positive that the #MeToo movement is a sham, and only a politically motivated tool that benefits left-wing women. It does not care a damn if a conservative woman is assaulted by a man, therefore the movement is a one-sided vehicle of socialism and soviet style political ideology. NOTICE: If anyone finds out the name of the now-infamous White House intern, please leave a comment below.",1

"A visit to Prague can be for many different reasons, it could be to take in the breathless scenery of the beautiful city and visiting historic buildings that are found in the Old Town or it could be to take advantage of the bustling nightlife that is on offer. Adults travelling without children may want to take the opportunity to visit one of Prague’s casinos and then maybe try your luck playing some online slots back in the hotel? And although the city undoubtedly comes alive when the sun sets for the evening, there are still plenty of things to do throughout the day. One of those could be going to watch one of Prague’s many Soccer clubs in action. NEW FRONTIERS Eastern Europe has a long list of legendary clubs that before the collapse of the Iron Curtain were shrouded in a air of mystery, the only possible viewing of any clubs East of Berlin was if they were fortunate enough to paired with the likes of Real Madrid or Liverpool in continental competition. Thankfully though now that Europe’s borders are much more accessible, it has bought with it a rise in Soccer tourism and the city of Prague is at the forefront of a burgeoning industry that has grown over the past decade or so. Admittedly the standard of Soccer on display might not be at the very highest level especially when compared to the likes of La Liga in Spain or the English Premier League, but the atmosphere once in the ground is one that cannot be rivalled. Add the fact that the ticket prices are not the eye watering sums that would usually find when watching the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United and a trip to one of Prague’s Soccer clubs does actually represent good value for money. While one should not also forget the fact that Czech lager is some of if not the best produced in the world, so what better combination could there be then a couple of cold pints of Pilsner Urquell while taking in a game. FORMER LEGENDS The name that is mainly synonymous with Soccer in this city is undoubtedly Sparta Prague, the club has been fortunate to call home to many international stars such as midfielder Tomas Rosicky and towering forward Jan Koller. Tomas Rosicky Not only have they been a production line for some of the greatest players to represent the Czech Republic international team they are also the dominant force when it comes to domestic Soccer in this country. The club have won no fewer than 33 domestic league titles, more than any other club. However, it must also be mentioned that they have not reached the summit of the Czech First League since the 2013/14 when they last won the title. They may be going through something of a fallow period in times of titles, not winning the league in four years is almost unheard of and it is arguably all the more galling when they have to look at their cross-city rivals celebrating success of their own. LONG TERM RIVALS Every big city needs a Soccer rivalry and Prague is no different, for every Sparta fan there is also a fan of Slavia also. In the 2016/17 campaign they won the Czech First League for the first time in eight years. A win that was all the more sweeter considering that they extended the trophy drought for their arch rivals Sparta. In terms of historic wins though they have not quite managed the same level of overall success. Slavia have been fortunate enough to win the Czech First League just 17 times in comparison to Sparta’s impressive 33. Therefore, arguably Prague’s second club are going to have a lot of work to do if they are to rule the roost in terms of trophies. However, there is not just the rivalry between Sparta and Slavia that is offer should you decide to take in a game during your time in Prague. This hot bed of Sport also offers up the possibility to watch other classic clubs. OTHER OPTIONS One that springs to mind is that of FK Dukla Prague, arguably made famous thanks to the song by British band ‘Half Man Half Biscuit’ who released the modest 1986 hit ‘All I Wanted Was A Dukla Prague Away Kit’ Arguably one for the Soccer hipsters, a visit to watch Dukla unfortunately is not quite what it would have been before hand. This is due to the fact that the club its original guise ceased to exist in 1996 when it merged with FC Pribram. So here you have a choice, you can either follow the original Dukla Prague in their new legacy as they are called 1. FK Pribram, however that would mean dropping down to the second tier of Czech Soccer. Or one the other hand if you feel you need your Dukla fix, then this is possible thanks to the club that has taken over the mantle. Although not legally recognised as the natural successor, FK Dukla Prague has gone a long way to restoring the pride that was once felt in the club. After winning the Czech Second Division in the 2010/11 season, they have since been a mainstay in the First League, and although they do not quite get the attendance figures that Slavia and Sparta do their fans are no less passionate. The list of options does not end their though, Bohemians 1905 should certainly not be forgotten. As the name perhaps suggests the club was started more than a century ago and although they have been a staple in Czech Soccer they have managed just a solitary league title. One that came over 30 years ago, back in 1982/83 to be precise. Since then their maiden Czech First League title they have failed to get anywhere near being the team to beat but again they have an ardent fan base that one day hopes that they will return to the very top. With the amount of options available to you, there is no reason not to check out a game of Soccer while embarking on your Prague visit. The only question is which team will you lending your support too?",1
"American socialist democrats have gained control of the House of Representatives, for the first time in eight years, and it’s all thanks to illegal immigrants and selective internet censorship that got them there. Dirty tricks and election meddling “If it was not for the illegal aliens who we helped get across the border and gave them lots of free stuff, they would not have voted democrat. If it was not for the massive internet purge project by socialist tech companies prior to the Midterms, then the story would have been very different. The socialist purge of hundreds of thousands of conservative leaning bloggers/political pundits/news sites, really worked, because we silenced their voices. They were party to mass illegal underhand practices and electioneering engineered to benefit the democrats, so we are proud of those tech companies, thank you. This is why illegal immigration and censorship is so important to us,” Nancy Pelosi, tearful but joyous told the press after the final results came through. James O'Keefe @JamesOKeefeIII BREAKING @Project_Veritas: Non-Citizens Voting in Texas?

The Democrats now have the numbers to fuck Mr Trump up the ass especially with his proposed laws in the House and launch a string of damaging investigations into his administration through the committees they will control. The vindictive nature of socialism leaves questions on what investigation will be more damaging to Trump, his tax affairs or the ongoing Mueller investigation? The good news of the night included the loss of Texas for Beto O’Rourke whose campaign workers misused campaign funds, but will never be investigated by the FEC. “The dems are looking to impeach Trump any way they can, whether he drops a paperclip or leaves the toilet seat up, and they will find some piece of dirt to render him useless. He can forget about that wall being ever built, or that 14th Amendment bull. He’s a dead duck walking!” another jubilant democrat yelled after the results came in. The Democrats are right. You can win if you take away the voice of the other candidates in an election. By silencing the opposition through illegal, immoral purges and massive censorship, you can win. You can also win by harnessing the power of bribery, by helping millions of illegal aliens into the USA, you can tell them they have to vote democrat, and they will be your numbers, they will be your army, and it really does work as a technique that the Republicans do not utilise.

"Our mobile devices have become such an integral part of our daily lives that it’s difficult to picture not being able to do something on your smartphone or tablet. We socialise on our mobile devices, build friendships, find our way when lost, plan every aspect of our everyday lives, play games, and much more. Playing games has become a huge component of mobile interaction and, for many, is one of the prime reasons or motivations for purchasing a mobile device in the first place. Casino Gaming on the Go There are all sorts of mobile games one can enjoy for both smaller smartphone handsets as well as larger tablet-type devices. Some of these are available as free apps, while others require a cash purchase before you can download them to your device from your relevant app store. The free apps can be very good, although most of them will include advertising/spam or will require ‘in-app’ purchases in order to progress in the game. Online casinos have now also cottoned on the idea of producing a mobile app based on their regular online (desktop) casino platform. In most cases, these look and feel exactly the same as their big brothers, complete with a wide range of diverse casino games, all optimised for the smaller mobile screen. However, as more and more apps become available on app stores for Android and iOS (Apple iPhone and iPad), it becomes more difficult to find the best app for your needs. Those using Windows Phone operating systems or Blackberry are also now beginning to enjoy a wider range of suitable apps, and the same problem applies. Zeroing in on Trustworthy, Reliable Casino Apps If you happen to be looking for a solid, trustworthy online casino app in your relevant app store, you may be quite surprised and perhaps even overwhelmed at the sheer number of options available to you. There are hundreds of casino apps available but it is very important to realise a few things before you actually make your selection. You can find new sites and then look for reviews on Google. All apps are graded by users which is a good starting point in narrowing down your list of potentially great casino apps. It is a good idea to go into each app and see what users are saying about the app, which should indicate whether the casino app is worthy of your consideration. User feedback is like reading a micro review about whether the app can deliver on gaming, safety, user friendliness and reliability. Another good idea is to Google different online casinos and read related reviews on them. You can find dozens of independent reviews on top online casinos, including their mobile app options, giving you information on all key elements including: Safety and security Gaming options Mobile customer support Options for real money gambling Compatible devices Bonuses and other promotions Using these points as a starting point and a guideline, finding great online casino apps becomes a lot easier to do. Once you’re happy with the casino app, installing it is easy and only takes a few seconds to complete. Perhaps more importantly, uninstalling it is even faster, allowing you to try similar casino apps in case you aren’t that happy with the app you chose to go with.",1
"These Midterm elections in America are crucial for the survival of the nation. On one hand there is business, innovation, and change to a more proud insular country that is self sufficient yet strong in the global field, priding itself in manufacturing its own goods and destiny. This side values freedom, liberty, prosperity for every facet of the US population. This is the side of Trump, who has brought actual change to America, and reinvigorated its core. The other side of the coin is Detroit-style dilapidation, Venezuelan socialism, open borders that will strain every part of the country’s infrastructure, Marxism, anti-business practices with high taxes, removal of free speech, massive censorship, soviet political correctness, self-hatred, and ultimately Chinese communism. Destruction of the US constitution. Gun grabs. Hand in hand with massive spending on socialist pet projects that waste taxpayers money and bankrupt the country into further deficit oblivion like Obama did. This is the side of the fractured socialist democrats who revel in mob rule, internet lynchings with no due process that lead to destroying whole swathes of innocent lives. This is the side of so-called progressive inclusive people who do not value freedom in any of its forms, whether freedom of expression or art or life. The choice is ultimately up to the voters, and if early polling shows, the fury of the socialists may trump the Trump supporters. It is however not too late to change this form of forced voting and use of illegal immigrants. Hopefully, many people have awoken from the NPC programming meted out on democrat followers. It is still not too late to awaken from the brainwashing, the incessant soviet repetition to instill their programming in your subconscious mind. The socialist American party, utilises a soviet technique of constant repetition to program their followers so they obey without question. This technique was used in the USSR and is still utilised in communist China to brainwash their youth to be completely subservient to the communist ideology and never to question the motives of their superior comrades. The democrat socialist party of America also utilises techniques devised by Saul Alinsky in the ways of mob rule, and civil unrest to achieve their soviet communist objectives. The choice is yours Americans, you either vote for your country, or you vote against it. One thing is for sure, the socialist democrats, now so far left, are bordering on heavy Marxism, and despise everything that is American. Vote for your country or vote for your enemy.

"Thanks to the constant lies and closed curtain deals being engineered with the EU regarding Brexit, the Remainer led Cabinet, and the lies spewed by PM Theresa May betraying 17.4 million Brexit voters, the Conservative party are now a sinister party, never to be trusted ever again. Brexit voters were promised an end to EU rule, this meant an end to the UK under the Customs Union, and end to free movement and an end to rule from the ECJ and other EU controlling factors. One of the main reasons for voting was to get our parliament back, as a sovereign British parliament, not dictated to by Brussels. Sovereign freedom of Britain, to make our own laws again, and not be subjected to restrictive authoritarian rules as prescribed by the EU. The Conservative party throughout the last two years has shown great weakness, and an untrustworthy side which is frankly unnerving. If Mrs. May says one thing, then does the complete opposite thing, whilst still saying she is honouring the will of the people, this is a blatant lie, and her lies have been very damaging not only to her own integrity but to the integrity of the party as a whole. Theresa May and her Remainer Chancellor, Philip Hammond, along with her Remainer Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins are lying blatantly to Brexit voters daily as they prepare to push through the Chequers Brino deal which will doom Britain to become a vassal state to the EU indefinitely without a legal way out of the Customs Union. No one will vote for the Conservative party in 2020 who is not a Remainer. Yes, they will get some votes from the pro-EU faction, but the majority of people who voted for Brexit will vote with their feet and walk away from the Tories. The Conservative party today is a disgrace, and they will be duly punished for their treachery and treasonous lies towards the electorate as well as their perversion of democracy within the UK. The biggest fatality is democracy, because what we have seen in the last two years, is that there is very little of it left in Britain today. No justice, or democracy leaves a land which is seething with self hatred and is unjust, with little or no value anymore. To this end, it will be deemed as appropriate that many will abandon the Conservative party because of Theresa May and her cronies. These monstrous liars, quislings and treacherous chicken-hearted wasters who have demeaned Britain’s highest establishments with their all hat and no cattle empty worthless words, will be doomed to the opposition benches for the next thirty or forty years. Yes, by not voting Conservative anymore, the millions who voted for Brexit, will condemn Britain and the Conservative party to a purgatory worse than any death — the Labour party. We’ve lost everything else so we have nothing left to lose. This action alone will be fit enough punishment for the nation but it will be a lesson hard learned for the Tories, who stood by as their party was trashed asunder by the likes of Theresa May and her treacherous entourage of yellow lickspittle cowards and traitors. No one of any value will vote Tory ever again.",1
"George Soros is certainly not someone who does things in halves, and his latest purchase certainly proves it. The Landing Craft, Tank, (LCT) was made famous in campaigns like D-Day, and the Pacific war in the Second World War. The most common LCTs were the Mk5 LCT, which were used by British and American troops to land on the Normandy beaches on June, 6, 1944. Most of the LCTs were set for the scrap yard, however were saved by the plentiful money trench that is George Soros’ bank account. “He came into our office and saw a picture of one of our scrap LCTs. He asked me how many I had, and when I said 40,000, he took out his cheque book and wrote down a figure. He handed it to me, and I had to sit down. I just said take them, and he did,” Miles Kapernicko, the owner of one of the world’s biggest shipyards told Shipping magazine. It is not known what the price paid was for all the LCTs however an expert in the field estimated it to be in the region of $4,000 000 000 at 100k a piece. Many of the scrap LCTs will also need extensive repairs to make them seaworthy again, adding on extra cost to the Soros project. No one knows exactly what Soros is going to do with the landing craft, however some have an idea. “This will be like D-Day on Juno beach, or Omaha, but most probably will be migrants from South America onto the beaches of California, or from Morocco or Libya onto Italian, Spanish and Greek beaches. Our guess is that the numbers of landing craft landing at the same time will be unstoppable. No authorities can possibly stop that sort of invasion, and under the terms of the Geneva convention, these migrants would be classed as non-combatants and will all be accepted as asylum seekers. Many who land will just rush into land and disappear,” Johan Demisires, an expert on illegal migration told the Washington Times. If Soros can pull off migrant caravans on land, he can certainly pull off a sea invasion force numbering over 40,000 craft. If each craft can carry a capacity of 4,000 migrants, this would mean an illegal migrant invasion force of 160,000,000 could be deployed onto any Western nation at any time. The logistics for such an operation would probably be wide and numerous, however Mr. Soros and his empire of helpers are more than capable of pulling such an incredible feat off with little or no trouble. “If Soros pulls this one off, it will make D-Day look like a Sunday picnic outing. One can imagine the immense power and fear felt seeing one of these migrant naval invasions taking place. It would be a historic event,” historian, Gene Altrew, at the Smithsonian Institute told the Washington Times.",1
"Doxeter, city centre was completely inundated by a mob of violent vegans on Friday, after another butcher shop opened on the High Street. Police were called out to the scene where vegans rampaged but stood there powerless, and did nothing. Dean Wotherfoster, 49, a butcher for 20 years was assaulted by a pack of vegans who smothered him with organic hummus, beetroot and lentil tabbouleh, topped off with a smattering of vegan nutroast. “I was chopping some ribs off a dead cow when in popped these vegans. They started to go red in the face as I chopped away. I thought nothing of it. Then they called me a ‘murderer’ and a ‘killer’ and when I tried to explain that I had not done the killing of the animals, they got even angrier and smothered me with vegan food. I must say, it was rather delicious, as I had skipped lunch.” One man who was sitting on a bench eating a sausage roll, was dragged by his feet to a vegan restaurant and a vegan sausage roll was stuffed into his mouth forcibly nearly choking him. Three workers on their break were tucking into their beef burgers when the vegan mob turned up. One unnamed vegan woman took the baps off the burgers then vomited on the meat. She then put the baps back on and forced the men to eat the burgers with vomit on them. They were later stretchered off to a hospital. By that time, a mob of vegans converged from the east, and bundled into a kebab shop where they screamed at the top of their voices at the staff. The vegans led a live goat and sheep into the kebab shop and forced the staff and customers to look at the live animals for four hours. After they left, the staff and customers were so traumatised that they threw down their kebabs and fled. At one shop selling milkshakes, a lactating woman removed her top and proceeded to shout ‘cow milk is extracted from grieving mothers’, she then squirted milk from her breasts into the milkshakes of customers whilst crying at the top of her voice. To her astonishment some customers continued drinking their milkshakes afterwards. All across the country, many towns were simultaneously attacked in what seems to be a coordinated attack. Message of the day, don’t fuck with vegans.",1
"Investigative reporter, James O’Keefe for Project Veritas has uncovered massive campaign fraud for the Beto O’Rourke democrat campaign in Texas. The tapes reveal that vast amounts of funds on prepaid campaign credit cards which were meant to be used solely for campaign purposes were misappropriated and used to support Honduran illegal aliens from the migrant caravan coming over the border. These acts were perpetuated to gain votes and voters from the migrant caravan. • “I just hope nobody that’s the wrong person finds out about this.” • “It’s f***ing happening.” O’Rourke Campaign Staff Uses Pre-Paid Cards for Honduran Alien Supplies • “Don’t ever repeat this…” Campaign Staffers Explain How to Hide Campaign Expenditures for Aliens • “If you get caught in some sort of violation that’s like a $50,000 fine,” “For me I can just ignore the rules and I’m like f**k it.” • Transporting Aliens to “airports… bus stations,” “None of this is like sh*t there is a rulebook for” • Staffer Says She Sent Texts to Director; Told Campaign Manager Jody Casey, Who Says “Don’t Worry” Naturally, there is a stone cold silence from CNN and other so-called news services in America who are firmly aligned with the American socialist party, the democrats. Not one single socialist news source has yet reported on the massive levels of Beto fraud, and there seems to be a hush over the whole criminal case. The Federal Election Committee has also been silent about the Project Veritas findings even though the filming shows blatant disregard for any electoral rules or regulations. Below is the video criminalising all that appear in it. It is not certain how long the video will stay up as it is on the YouTube platform. It is not known how much of the $38 million funds raised in only three months from donations for Beto O’Rourke are being used on illegal aliens migrating into the US but maybe the FEC needs to look into that themselves, as the proof is right there.",1
"The visiting contingent of communist Chinese censors who visited the AlphaGogle campus in Mountain View, California, were said to be impressed at how the American company is adopting their authoritarian techniques in censorship. “We had just left the Farcebook campus in Palo Alto, when we got a call from Gogle. They explained that there had been some employees who were not so happy with the communist ideology, and that we should come over to re-educate them, as well as give more tips on how to censor non-communists better,” Xing Xao Ming, Chief Comrade in charge of Censorship for the Chinese state’s Information Ministry told Chinese state news Xinhua agency. Beat down There’s nothing like a good beating to get things going. The team of Chinese censors asked Gogle employees which one of them was not a supporter of Chairman Mao, or Soviet ideology Marxism. The Gogle officer pointed out a man sitting in the back, who had been outed earlier after his private emails were read out aloud to everyone assembled. “We converged on the employee, then tied his hands behind his back, then his feet were tied to his arms tightly so he could barely breathe. I asked an assistant to remove the employees trendy $450 moccasins, and socks. This form of torture and education is accepted fully in China so there was nothing to worry about. We then brought out a long flexible stick and beat the soles of his feet, all the while asking who he pledges allegiance to. At first, the screams were too loud for any words to be understood, but on the 40th stroke, he started to sound like a communist again. ‘Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!’ he yelped. He was then taken away on a Gogle stretcher with some fresh frappuccino to recover. We then moved on to the next suspect, who was caught uploading a pro-Trump video to YouTube.” Obey Chinese communist directive 39744-12 from the little red book states that all employees must pledge allegiance to Chairman Mao, and must abhor any form of free speech or free thought that is not sanctioned by the People’s Chinese Communist Party. Although Gogle has not yet adhered to the Chinese communist technique of firing squads, there is still time for the company to adapt their working practices to purge the company of any form of dissent. Information officer, Darcy Hernandez, says that compliance to Gogle authoritarian directives are a must within the global population, as well as employed staff on campus: “If you do not comply to our directives, we delete you, we demonetize you, and we effectively ruin your livelihood. You must adhere to all censors when they come telling you to censor your website because it has a different ideological political message other than communism. Marxism is the only way forward, and we have made this very clear by purging as many websites, and channels from the internet worldwide which we fully control now. We welcomed this week, a group of Chinese censors who very kindly gave us some extra tips, and advised us on best practices to censor non-communist content, and employees who do not agree with our political ideology. You can hide, but we will eventually find you and weed you out. We monitor everything.” Ah, a good day’s work spreading the Chinese communist message of censorship and thought compliance. Next stop for the censor team, Twatter. ",1
"Trump train, twitter When it comes to keeping his word, Donald J. Trump does not mess around. He vowed to protect the borders during his election speeches, and today, as a migrant caravan snakes its way towards the southern border of the United States, the tanks, the APCs, the support vehicles, the military troops are getting ready. Trump is not going to be held ransom by the demands of the organisers of this caravan making its way to the US from Honduras. Already, he has threatened to cut the funds and aid that America throws away each year to these Latin American nations, where the money is siphoned off into Swiss accounts by corrupt officials, and not delivered to the people for aid. Kal @RightWingLawMan Who is paying for these trucks? Who is feeding these people? The group is now rumored to be around 15K with estimates it will be 50k at the border! And what if it's really 100k? If they successfully get in what’s to stop a million a month later?? 503 5:49 PM - Oct 30, 2018 603 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy Naturally, the NGOs and other organisations related to known globalist sources have made a great effort to engineer the migrant caravan to coincide with the US midterm elections. This will be Trump’s Alamo, where he will unleash rockets and bullets if need be onto the desperate men, women and children being used as pawns by forces they have no understanding or acknowledgement of. Speaking on Thursday, Trump was adamant that he will not be swayed by the televisual reports of Honduran women carrying babies crying. “This is a de-facto invasion. The guns these people carry are not rifles, but the left wing media. That is their weapon. I have ordered 15,000 of our finest troops to the border. These are great men and women who follow orders, they are patriots who defend this nation. I have ordered up tanks, and other military vehicles. We will open fire on anyone who attempts to rush our border walls, we will shoot anyone who tries to cross over illegally. It’s a no brainer folks. Either you apply to come here legally, or don’t. This is why we have laws in this country, and I intend to uphold the law at our borders.” Kal @RightWingLawMan Train in Arizona recently heading southbound. Trump ain't playin' 20.3K 2:57 PM - Oct 30, 2018 14.1K people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy The scenario will thus play out as a curious attraction streamed live on all channels. As the migrant hordes rush the border, a barrage of gunfire and tank shells will simultaneously explode around the rushing mass of human misery. The leftist media shrieking with outrage will be out shrieked by the cheering right wing media. As the smoke will clear, there will only be silence apart from a few groaning bodies here or there amongst the bloodied bodies. Fiction aside, the reality of the situation will probably involve lots of white tents to keep these miserable people out of America. They will be clothed and fed until they are bored, and realise they will not get anywhere anytime soon. The question one must ask is, just because there is poverty and lack of labour in some areas of the globe, does this give these people the human right to impose themselves by the thousand onto other sovereign territories and enter illegally by force?",1
"“The Pan-European project envisioned by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, will eventually win over sovereign states within Europe as time passes, and regimes settle down. “The initial plan cannot be party to any divergence for long periods of time, and populism, as well as nationalistic fervour, patriotism, is limited to dying populations, who will eventually disappear along with their aspirations of a renewal of nationalism. “The European project, despite Brexit, will continue, because there will not be any meaningful Brexit. The British who are controlling the negotiations are firmly ensconced within the European side, and the real Brexiteers do not have any power in their parliament. We will therefore see a faux removal of the UK from the EU, thanks to Theresa May and her euro-centric Cabinet. This folly, will enable May to declare she completed the will of the people however in reality, Britain will be firmly placed within EU laws and regulations indefinitely. Britain has already eaten the multicultural pill, and there is no going back, however much some may try to reverse things. “The main raison d’etre for the Pan-European project was to counteract the Russian threat, as well as bolster Europe’s standing next to the super power of the United States. For this to engender a tactical advantage within the Western European diaspora there would have to be a genetic blend imported into Europe, to increase diversity, and plant the seeds of global acceptance. The homogenous nature of Europe must be bred out generationally, to create a new European, one who is a blend of many global bloodlines. This is why German Chancellor, Angela Merkel accepted with open arms over a million refugees from the Middle East in 2015. Similarly, Southern Italy has seen a deluge of human traffic from the African continent, which under the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan is key to increasing Europe’s diverse population targets. “Throughout the past three or four decades, we have seen the integration within Europe of diverse genetic mixtures flourish, and even though there have been attempts to halt this mixing, it has continued, and will continue until the whole of Europe is composed of a darker hue, from the extremities of the southern border to the north, east, and west. “The European project will move forward as planned, and so will its single currency. “Across the Atlantic Ocean, we have the United States, who is momentarily resisting the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan of integration, the pan-American uniting force of South and North America will go ahead despite the aspirations of Mr. Trump, who is imprisoned within a socialist system he alone cannot change. The only way Trump can change things permanently is to start a civil war, and win it. This latter scenario is highly unlikely, and the eventual demise of Mr. Trump will herald the resumption of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan to unite the South with North America, relinquishing any national borders. The momentum for this break down in North American sovereignty is too great to stop without military intervention, and it is highly improbable that Trump will resort to such methods. “As new regimes, within nation states, come and go, there will be a stop and start method towards the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan, and this is perfectly permissible simply because this plan extends to centuries, and was never intended as a quick fix program. “We know of the challenges facing integration of certain global areas like Russia and China, but these will come eventually under the auspices of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan. “All nation states will be moulded as one eventually, all holding an ethnically heterogeneous model, all borders will become like the EU’s Schengen zone, and eventually governance of all global sections will be ruled as one, centrally from Europe. The human race, will abhor nationalism to any particular state, and will only hold allegiance to the global state, where all economic, judicial, and every-day governance will preside.” Former EU President Herman Van Rompuy was awarded the European Prize Coudenhove-Kalergi 2012 “Peace and the European idea” for his exemplary work towards EU integration. You are all welcome in the EU. From Africa, Middle East, South-East Asia, and further. Please make your way into the EU. You can come into the EU from any border and you will be given food, homes, jobs, money. Ports of entry Greece, Italy, Spain, France, Black Sea. WELCOME TO THE EU!",1
"Let us celebrate the end of austerity. Standing amongst the grey miserable tower blocks, the smell of raw sewage and rotting garbage permeates the smog filled polluted air. This is Britain, and austerity has just ended officially. The High Roads now full of fried chicken shops, Polski Skleps, gambling dens and boarded up businesses covered in posters for the local DJ’s latest rave, only £5 to get in. Up above the high rises, the sky may be blue but it is replete with white lines criss crossing the air, these mysterious lines appearing from planes working day and night churning out chemicals that drop slowly onto the ground, to be ingested by the unknowing unawake population. The filthy pot holed roads, now a car park where the increase in traffic has been so immense from the EU, vehicles barely move over 15 MPH, people resigned to sitting in their cars twiddling their thumbs just stare out of their cars into nothingness. Driving in London is now such a nightmare, that it is preferable to simply crash your vehicle into a lamp post and walk. More cash has been allocated for the NHS we hear. That’s not what we find in the local GP’s office where queues of sick people snake out into the road, many too ill to stand just lie on the cold pavement and close their eyes in painful resignation to their fate. It can now take months to get a single appointment at your surgery. The immense influx of migrants over the years has effectively destroyed the NHS’ ability to function. God forbid you need hospital help, well you’re shit out of luck, there are no beds left. If you live in London, the daily stab victims coming through the doors are in a constant loop, blood and pieces of flesh dripping all over the tiles, and as you sit for your next appointment in eight hours time, you will no doubt see more stabbings and shootings directly in front of you, like some sort of theatrical display of death and mayhem played out in grotesque realism. The hospitals, replete with blood stained walls and mattresses, are now places where you go in and never come out again. They call it mercy, because living on a tiny island so overcrowded is like living in a nightmare that you can’t wake up from. If you manage to get an ambulance lottery ride to a hospital, the distraught overworked staff stick you in a corridor on a stretcher amongst the other cadavers. Your wait can last weeks or months, and sometimes surgery is conducted in the corridor if the doctors ever find your name tag. Many come here to die then are unceremoniously dumped in an oven and your ashes blasted over the city, an infernal snowing cloud of human misery. The rule for living in modern day Britain still suffering from mass migration is don’t ever get sick. Do everything you can to never fall ill, or you will put your life in serious danger. Just as Angela Merkel will be remembered as the woman who ruined Germany’s social service system, her counterpart, Tony Blair, will be known for war crimes, unfettered migration and the ruination of schools, hospitals and benefits, both of these monsters are socialists who have contributed to the destruction of their own nations from within. When Gordon Brown, the Labour Chancellor, and later unelected PM, sold off Britain’s gold reserves at the bottom of the market, he knew very well what he was doing, and did it with a grim Scottish smile. Let us thus celebrate the end of austerity, maybe on the way to a food bank to get a few rotting turnips to mash into a soup that will sustain you and your family of five until your next meal in a week. The grey miserable cities and streets of Britain, where the homeless are now part of the furniture, and the daily tax slaves begin their day of work so they can take home a few pennies after being taxed to the hilt, perpetually rising council tax, electricity bill, water bill, gas bill, internet bill, telephone bill, insurance bill, slashing the wrist and seeing the jet of blood spurt across the carpets and walls are a thankful reprieve to a life of utter meaningless tax slave misery. You are a tax zombie, condemned to a life of commuting for hours every day then death. Your meaningless life only compounded by episodes of Come Dancing or Big brother on the BBC taxed television you own in your leaking freezing grey home. It’s another day at work, the buses and trains are now full to the brim, the roads are the usual car parks, the hospitals, something from the Crimean war, the schools, overloaded where the English language is now a foreign sounding mush of lost syllables. You work the whole day and come home, then go out the next day to work in the same meaningless poorly paid job that destroys every single part of your fucking soul. Stagnant wages, brought down by the millions who took the jobs the Brits were deemed too lazy to do, your EU migrant boss is not happy with you, so he fires you. You breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe it is time to queue for days at the GP’s office and beg to be put on the waiting list for a mobile buggy, to drive you everywhere because you are too lazy to walk anymore. It’s okay though. Wake up. Haw Haw Hammond has been told to end austerity. Everything is ok now, Britain has been saved. Hurrah! Just pop more pills, and jam another needle into your ankle, when the mist rises and the comforting opioid blanket covers you in your grey freezing rat infested home, these are the only words that will go through your frazzled mind…austerity..over…austerity…over…auster…",1
"One thing about the Theresa May Chequers Plan is that it will be nearly impossible to get out of once it is implemented. This is something the PM has lied about to her own Cabinet, who are being steered into a deal that will doom the UK to be a ‘vassal state’ of the EU indefinitely. Once the UK is signed up to the customs backstop, ministers will not be able to change anything, and there will be no ‘exit mechanism’ to break out of the backstop. Even if the MPs try to change things legally, this would take decades and most certainly result in failure, Theresa May’s own Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, has evaluated. The Chequers proposal involves the permanent continuation in the UK of all EU laws which relate to goods. All goods on the UK manufactured in the UK for the UK domestic market, or imported from non-EU countries, would be permanently subject to these controls. The obligation to follow the EU rulebook for goods would gravely impair the UK’s ability to conduct an independent international trade policy. In particular, it will prevent Britain from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for goods in trade treaties and this is likely to destroy the prospect of successfully achieving meaningful agreements with some of the prime candidates such as the USA and Australia. Theresa May’s version of Brexit which is known as a BRINO (Brexit in name only) would condemn the UK to be stuck permanently as a vassal state within the EU’s legal and regulatory swamp. The UK would still have to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings hindering its ability to develop an effective international trade policy or adapt the economy to take advantage of the freedom a real Brexit would have afforded it. The Theresa May Chequers capitulation will also mean that Britain will be stuck in the EU with no power to veto, and will still be sending vast amounts of money to Brussels, as well as being tied to EU regulations inhibiting its ability to make international trade deals. The destruction of Brexit by Theresa May and her Remainer allies, will ensure that no one who voted for a Brexit on June 23, 2016, will vote Conservative again, due mainly to the immense calculated betrayal by the prime minister and other pro-eu conservative ministers who aided and abetted the Chequers capitulation. The Conservative party will be consigned to the political wilderness for the next twenty to thirty years, because losing the vote of the leavers will let in the current opposition. Quite, rightly, no one will trust the Conservative party ever again, because it has reneged on every promise for Brexit, and abandoned its grassroots.",1
"Too obvious. It has been a whirlwind few weeks into the run up of the midterm elections in the US. It started off with a massive purge of conservative websites from social media and the internet search engines, then went on to the Kavanaugh farce, then the orchestrated migrant caravan, and now we have a Native American Filipino MAGAbomber who has been made to believe he is a ‘white supremacist’ when he does not have a drop of Aryan blood in his body, driving around in an insanely ludicrous postered van with pictures of Hillary Clinton in crosshairs, sending fake bombs to democrats. If this is not election tampering then what is? These events are beyond any form of satire, however what gives everything away is the timing and who benefits from these events. Cui bono? Who benefits? Who stands to gain from all of these orchestrated events? They are all designed to make the democrats look like victims, and thus, the people should vote for them to get the other side out of congress. Anything that makes the Republicans look bad, makes the democrats look good and gets them votes. The magabomber fiasco is almost akin to finding the passport of one of the 911 hijackers immaculately preserved amongst the pulverised dust of the Twin Towers. Funny how the passport survived in perfect condition and everything else was crushed to dust. The official story was of course that a mystery man appeared out of nowhere, handed it to the police chief, then disappeared again, never to be found. Both stories are highly implausible. So, we have some idiot driving around in a van practically advertising himself as a security risk, apprehended and detained eventually. Not only is this guy an obvious plant, but he is possibly an alter. He was most probably vetted for months and then given the go-ahead a week or so before the midterm elections. We will never know the truth, because an operation like this is cloaked in utmost secrecy and this guy’s handlers are way out of the picture by now. Now, if you can get a Native American/Filipino person to believe he is a ‘white supremacist, then you can get him to believe and do anything…absolutely anything. Case closed. (cue Twilight Zone music..)",1
"The Global Population Research Institute in Rome, Italy reveals the problems that globalists will have to deal with in the future. “For the past thirty years the West has been seemingly under attack from forced third world migration, and from economic means of tying the West to communist regions like China. This was all pre-planned, and orchestrated by key globalist players as well as their counterparts within national governments. “During this major upheaval, whole industries have died, and others have sprouted from their ashes. Whole areas of indigenous Western communities have seen their countries changed permanently by migration from the poorest nations. Cultures have been destroyed, and we have seen massive White Flight from whole cities in the West. “This forced globalisation where once rich communities have been flooded by the third world, are the work of globalists who did not do their homework. They did not understand the consequences of flooding the West with poorly skilled migrants, millions of people who instead of being a positive for the economy have drained it, turned wages down, become a burden on social services, and crowded the hospitals. “There is now a massive polarisation within communities, a vast chasm of ill feeling, and even thoughts of civil war, as resources run low from the migratory influx. “In Britain, we are seeing Brexit. In Italy we are seeing rebellion. In Hungary more dissent to forced migration. In Germany, the major recipient of migration, we have seen vast communities completely ignored by the authorities as they cater for the needs of migrants over their own citizens. In the USA, we are seeing migrant caravans daily coming from the poorest South American countries, organised by NGOs and other agencies. In France, we are seeing whole boulevards and neighborhoods taken over by tent cities made up of Sub-Saharan and Middle Eastern migrants. “The plight of these people are a symptom of global overpopulation, unfettered breeding, creating poverty, disease and pollution, then imported into the West by globalists. “Naturally, the elite globalists do not have to contend with this migratory influx. They live away from these areas, secluded in luxurious environs, where every whim is catered for. The globalist elite have special medicines that are not on the civilian market, and live on food that is not tainted by chemicals that the rest of the population have to live on. Their water is pure, and every month, large sums of money are deposited in their accounts, not only from the taxpayer, but from their companies. “Globalism is good. Globalism is a necessity when it comes to business. The new world order once assimilated will function in a global single market capacity, however the architects of globalism have underestimated the fight for national boundaries. The elite globalists have underestimated thousands of years of European history, and they will have to evaluate how they have misread the process of forcing migration on to Europe and the United States. “Why does China not take any third world migrants, Japan, Russia or Saudi Arabia? This is a simple question to answer. Because they have designed their societies and culture to reject assimilation with any other culture other than their own. This technique is not prevalent with the liberal socialist blank canvas of the West, where to be proud of one’s nation is immediately pounced upon and the individual is labelled a Nazi. Acceptance of migratory forces is therefore accompanied by liberal guilt if not adhered to by the masses and governmental factions. “The failed current globalist migratory experiment is now leading to serious unrest in the populations of the West. Fractured societies cannot be fixed by one singular solution alone, there will have to be many variables, however, the globalists have forcibly fractured whole swathes of people and at high speed creating a doppler effect in population shift factors. “The globalist elite will have to adjust their technique, and move towards stronger methods to impart their message. This could involve complete breakup of nations within the global matrix, internal warfare, or even warfare externally across borders. There are more step to take, and they will not be painless. “To exercise change in the long-term, there may have to be some eggs broken to make that omelette. True change can only come from a clean slate, a purge of the old system, and ultimately global warfare. This is the only way the new world order will truly rise, because once the globe is purged of the excess, and the old problems, it can start afresh creating the system that does not need wars, forced migration, mass consumerism, pollution, or mass factory farming. Once this has been achieved, a controlled population will be assembled which will allow the much needed regeneration of the earth’s resources.”",1
"Marvin Rogers, 63, an avid gambler all his life has today joined a migrant caravan of 20,000 gamblers travelling from Carson City, Nevada to Las Vegas. The distance of 466 miles has been crushing to many of the gamblers who are grossly obese, and have to have junk food snacks every fifteen minutes. “We started at 6.30 am yesterday and we only got eight miles into the journey,” Pamela Bourdain, 38, told CBS local news. The migrant caravan has taken the American press by surprise because it contains only Americans who are going to besiege Caesars Palace and demand luxury rooms for all, free meals, and no limits gambling purses. “Blackjack and roulette, and a little bit of poker, then a sauna, some ladies of the night, some powder, and a large slap up meal in my room, then more gambling,” another gambler trudging along the highway told news reporters slobbering at the mouth at the very thought of it. Along the route, many residents cheer the gamblers along, even throwing casino chips at them to spur them on to their destination. President Trump, a seasoned gambler himself did not condone the migrant caravan of gamblers but made a joke about the convoy: “I do not condone a caravan of people walking on their feet to demand things from other people or nations, but I have ordered Stormy Daniels to be at her post in the casino so when the gamblers get there, she will have to service each and every one of them.” When contacted, the management of Caesars Palace, were not sure how to counteract the news that the caravan was on its way to their casino. “You’re saying that 20,000 gamblers in a walking migrant caravan are heading over here? You say they demand free meals, free gambling, free luxury suites and free prostitutes? Anselmo, come here right now. Get them Mexican boys to build a wall around the casino with gun turrets. Nothing is free in Vegas. Nothing!” Chief spokesman for the gamblers caravan, Dwight Oros, was adamant that the gamblers convoy had every right to do what they are doing. “We have every right to migrate in our thousands to anywhere we want and demand we get free food, free gambling chips, free luxury suites, and women. This is our right as humans, and nobody can stop us. We want our payday, we’re owed this goddammit!!” UPDATE As of 13.00 PDT today, the migrant convoy of gamblers will reach the outskirts of Las Vegas. As more news filters in, we will keep you updated.",1
"Equality minister, Maggie Dispersal, has warned Parliament of treating Mrs. May with “kid gloves”. “She should receive the same treatment that men receive. What is all this baloney about limiting language or you’ll hurt her feelings. Men receive this kind of vitriolic language every day of their lives. Men get punched, kicked, abused, spat at, and demeaned in every media that exists today. Women wanted ‘equality’ well you better suck it up buttercup. You can’t just pick and choose which bits of equality you want and discard the nasty bits.” Twisting the heated knife The truth is that Theresa May is seeking to betray Britain by tying it in with the EU Customs Union, ECJ, and Single Market indefinitely, something she said she would not do in the Conservative Manifesto and which goes against any EU Referendum voter who voted to leave the EU on June, 23, 2016. Theresa May has effectively hijacked Brexit and ignored the people’s vote, and created her own Brexit in name only. Besides other serious discrepancies like extending the ‘transition’ period by years or months, May has capitulated to every demand that the EU has thrown at her. Theresa May, controlled by Olly Robbins, a key Remainer, and her Chancellor, Haw Haw Hammond, another key Remainer, as well as her Cabinet made up of Remainers and former Brexiteer turncoats, is massively bolstered within the Remain camp. The Equalities Minister added: “No kid gloves with this prime minister. She knew what she was getting into when she was shoehorned into the job. Women want equality. Well fucking well deal with what men have to go through everyday of their lives. This is what true equality means. Take those gloves off, take the political knives out of their handles and have at her for her betrayal of Britain. This is not a picnic. This is war! We’re fighting for our country back from foreign parasitical forces for god’s sake!”",1
"When Marisa Papen graces her presence on a ‘holy religious’ site, she is bringing forth a message of freedom, of sensual nature, art, beauty and the timeless stance of the nude female form over restrictive, needless religious imprisonment. Religion restricts the female form, it imprisons it in useless garments, and denigrates the beauty it exudes within the jail of religious dogma. In Egypt, Marisa has been put in jail for her endeavours to enlighten the masses from their religious brainwashing, she is the ultimate female warrior, who elucidates the blind religious fanatics as they call for women to be imprisoned further through ancient rambling scriptures written by all male mystics high on mushrooms eons ago who were ultimately afraid of the female form and its sacred geometry. Has it come to this, for this female warrior to invade the very ramparts of religious fervour with her body, just to prove a point about humanity’s proclivity to create nonsensical religious scriptures? If there is a deity worth worshipping, it is the clean bronzed outline of her perfectly formed ass and breasts delicately reclining on a carpet in a bazaar, or climbing an Israeli flag pole in Jerusalem. Her latest sojourn entitled ‘Turkish Delight‘ showcases a daring display of bush in the Hagia Sophia mosque, stretched out on the roof tiles of Istanbul, boating on the sunset filled Bosphorus, and cosying up on Turkish carpets, amongst many Helmut Newtonesque photographs, which if the DS was not under serious censorship and puritanical Victorian monopoly-tech-company controls would happily publish here right now. The Ottomans were certainly not strangers to the nude female form, however any bush flashing in a mosque would certainly have been dealt with with a swift beheading. Regarding the current climate in Turkey today, she is lucky to have left the country unscathed. Marisa’s own words about her Turkish trip when we asked her to explain some of the reasoning to her art were indeed illuminating. “I believe religion has done more harm to this world than good. Wars are built upon religion. “As for women, having to cover yourself up from head to toe is incredibly disempowering. I only wore this Burka for a few hours but I felt so imprisoned. The fact that their skin is never exposed to the sun…. Without sunlight there wouldn’t be life. Think about that.. “Of course, it’s easier for religious people to say in a state of denial, and just follow the book. But if everyone would start questioning and thinking for themselves, I believe we would come to the same conclusion. We are all the same and fighting about whose God is not going to help humanity any further.” Marisa Papen has already been banned by Twitter but can be seen on Instagram or her website.",1
"EU NPCs An estimated 700,000 EU NPCs have gathered in central London today. The indoctrinated NPCs, all with the same EU placards all chanted the same thing over and over again. When asked why they were marching, many did not actually know, and said simply that they were told to march by their programmers. The EU ‘Non Player Characters’ marched from Park Lane towards Parliament Square where they stood chanting scripted programs given to them prior to the march. “We wish to stay in an undemocratic EU, where we are told what to say, what to think and everything is dictated to us. We have been programmed to obey the EU since childhood, and we have taught our NPC children to obey without question too. The collectivist EU Fasci-communo construct denies our freedoms and sovereignty, and imprisons the country under an authoritarian political and economic jail where there is no escape. Fuck Freedom. Fuck democracy. Fuck privacy. Fuck sovereignty. Fuck individualism. Fuck Freedom! Fuck Freedom!” the EU NPCs all chanted without their own consent or knowledge. Amongst the EU NPCs were a few MPs and celebrities who are in on the game, and are used by the programmers to bolster the deep indoctrination and EU programming. “We are here to oversee that the NPCs do not wake up. They admire us, and when they see us, this triggers further EU programming in their indoctrinated minds, this is how we control the NPCs,” a celebrity who receives large EU payments for the Actors Guild told the BBC. The NPCs, were cordoned by the police through their sheep pens, as they continued the march in orderly fashion all bleating the same mantras over and over again. All in all, it was another successful show of how mass indoctrination and mind control can work in tandem with very convincing effects. We must thank the EU and their programmers for a very effective control system utilised on the mindless pliable useful-idiot NPCs.",1
"We are in the midst of another humanitarian disaster threatening the West. Much like the migrant caravan that swept into Europe in 2015, we are now seeing the same phenomenon on the borders of the USA. This time, the migrant caravan started from Honduras, travelling through Guatemala and now Mexico towards the USA. The abyss dividing rich nations with poor is now only too evident globally, as many people see through the internet how the rich Westerners live their lives. The internet has been the catalyst for a true awakening, when previously those in Third World and Developing nations lived their lives in blissful ignorance. Now, they want what Americans have, and they are prepared to die trying to get across the U.S. border. Who is to deny the plight of human desperation, the utter poverty these people are spawned from, and destined to die in as well? America, the richest nation in the world, now headed by President Trump will have to make one of two decisions, as the millions in the migrant caravan makes its way closer to the border. Shoot first, or take them in. This is a human invasion of misery and poverty, with women and children, but to let them all in will send an even bigger message, it will resonate throughout South America. Yes, you are all welcome, then the torrent will be unstoppable, and America will effectively be inundated. No doubt, this migrant caravan, much like the EU migrant crisis in 2015, will define the presidency of Trump, because what he does now will be very important to elections, midterm, as well as general in 2020. Obviously orchestrated, the migrant caravan is a last ditch effort by unseen forces to unseat Trump, and they’re using the plight of millions of people for their cynical gain. This method is always justified in the dog eat dog world of internal and external politics. However, America, as a sovereign nation has a right to defend its borders from invasion, whatever its form. This human disaster waiting to happen is another symptom of overpopulation and needless breeding, which only creates misery, poverty, terror, and ultimately war. The other symptom, is the greed of the USA, which fuels its need to use up 60% of the earth’s resources whilst leaving others with nothing, it is the very success of America which may one day be its ultimate undoing. Would the world be a better place if the USA disappeared tomorrow? Yes No View Results ",1
"A s we all know Brexit is one of the biggest political events to take place in the UK across a few decades. The relationship of Britain with European Unions has been unsure since Brexit and its impact on the Forex market and other global markets is also unclear. Although no matter the impact there is certainly going to be a long lasting effect. GBP Perspective: Due to the surprising events of Brexit the Pound Sterling has suffered. It was predicted that because of the country’s high debt situation the exit from the European Union would ultimately mean that the UK would be failing to pay its loans. Fortunately the Forex market is stable and wasn’t dramatically affected by the exit. Traders have to keep a close on eye on their investments and for opportunities. Brexit effect on markets: The UK has about 44% of its exports that go to the European Union and 7% of the European Union’s trade is made up of the UK’s exports. But the effect of a Brexit would mean that the trade would decrease considerably. It’s highly likely that both the EU and the UK would experience a financial slump. However, it is precisely in these situations that anyone involved with CFD trading at brokers like City Index, can prosper and hopefully see profit. Forex: The pound sterling is likely to fall considerably if Britain does end up moving towards a hard Brexit. The Euro could also possibly suffer because of the huge economic shock but the dollar could benefit and increase should investors look to invest their money in a protected economy. This can present an opportunity for Forex traders as they look to take advantage of sharp movements in the markets. Stocks: On the basis of stocks you need to be confident precisely which companies and industries are most likely to be negatively affected by tariffs, border checks and service regulations. The EU tariffs are extremely high when it comes to agricultural products, clothing, vehicles, food and tobacco. Furthermore, when assessing border checks it is inevitable that changes in protocol here are most likely adversely affect manufactured goods which include electronics, cosmetics, perfume and sports equipment. This sentiment is also true when it comes to services such as airlines, transportation businesses and financial services, where the main fear is how EU regulations will affect the business. Commodities: A hard Brexit could have different effects on investors. Investors could seize the opportunity to invest in safe and secure assets; this would ultimately mean that the price of valuable metals such as gold and silver could rise. There is bound to be a decrease in demand which means that there will be an increase in inflation. The impact of a hard Brexit is clearly going to have a strong effect on trading but this means that traders or rather investors need to make smart decisions and be wise with what they invest in. With safe and smart decisions those who trade could ensure that they are not affected by a hard Brexit.",1
"J ohn Gosden’s supremely talented four-year-old Enable made headlines when going to France and upsetting the party, connections returning from Longchamp with the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe trophy tucked away in their hand luggage. The champion was driven home by jockey Frankie Dettori in stunning fashion, scoring off a starting price of even money, a chasing pack led by Sea of Class and Cloth of Stars biting away at her heels. Despite weakening in the closing stages, the victor held on to bank the €2,857,000 prize pot. Success on French soil over 1 ½ mile continued Enable’s fine recent form, having appeared in the winner’s enclosure at Kempton a month previously, landing the Group 3 September Stakes when 8/15 jolly, beating Crystal Ocean into second. The hat-trick is now on and handlers are aiming high with a trip to Churchill Downs for the Breeders Cup World Championships planned. The latest betting at https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing has Enable marked as favourite to win the Breeders Cup Turf on Saturday 3 November with 4/6 the most recent offer. The fact she’s amongst the shortest prices in one of the biggest horse racing meetings of the year explains exactly what traders think of the British invader. It’s little wonder the money men are desperate to keep her close as her credentials include, as well as the Arc, Group 1 races the Oaks, Irish Oaks, King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks according to https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/1236333/enable/form. As far as a run of form towards Kentucky goes it doesn’t get any better. That’ll ensure it’s not just the British pounds supporting Enable as she bids for a place in the history books. For as talented as Gosden’s pride and joy is, backing odds-on shots at the big meetings isn’t for everyone so there will be plenty happy to take a chance and oppose the fav with something at a bigger price. The main danger, according to the trading floor, is Roaring Lion who can be backed at 7/2. The three-year-old grey colt is another out of the Gosden yard and is another who carries bags of confidence thanks to a strong recent run of results. Last spotted winning the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown beneath the ride of Oisin Murphy in September, that accolade now sits in the trophy cabinet alongside the Juddmonte International Stakes, Coral-Eclipse and Dante Stakes. Further down the pecking order, we find Crystal Ocean for Sir Michael Stoute at 6/1. A winner of the Group 2 Hardwicke Stakes at Ascot in the summer before finding only one too good in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and September Stakes, ending 3 ½ lengths off Enable in the latter. There’s more of a price to be had if trusting your stake to Talismatic who stands out at an easy to love 12/1. The five-year-old colt hasn’t won in two tries since August, as his form shows http://www.attheraces.com/form/horse/Talismanic/GB/2890619 but his last success shouldn’t be easily overlooked, coming in the Group 3 Gontaut-biron Stakes around Deauville.",1
"The sad demise of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has prompted many journos to come up with some innovative ways to avoid certain death when entering a Saudi consulate. Only ever enter a Saudi consulate with a full camera crew. At least this way, if a hit squad member takes out a bone saw and tries to chop off your leg, there will be a crew of five or so press people to either deter the attacker by filming or fight him off. Alternatively, dump the camera crew mentioned earlier, and opt for a full squad of mercenaries armed to the teeth. If you are then greeted by a grinning Saudi with a bone saw and injection, just click your fingers and duck. After the shooting stops, simply fill in the necessary forms you came to fill, and leave. Enter the Saudi consulate wearing a full set of Medieval armour. This way, if a Saudi hit squad member tries to dismember you he will be shit out of luck. Don’t forget to bring a broadsword with you to defend yourself with. Hire a tank for the day. When outside, shoot a few volleys into the front of the consulate, or simply drive through to the office where you have to fill in the forms. If you are applying for a Visa, don’t forget to present your passport and additional ID through the tank’s hatch. Lastly, possibly the simplest of solutions. Never deal with Saudi journalistic ventures, and if you are a Saudi national, never write anything critical of the brutal regime. This year alone 44 journalists have been killed worldwide. From 1992 – 2018, 1323 journalists have been killed and 262 journalists imprisoned in 2017, mostly in Turkey.",1

"Lying duplicitous PM, Theresa May, went to Brussels again for the fifty millionth time to beg and grovel to her EU masters for a deal. Squalid “She was begging us, she dropped down on her knees, this pitiful character sobbing like a wet flannel, like a dog, so I pushed her away, disgusted at her weakness,” one EU official revealed in the pub afterwards. We already know that Theresa May is not capable of negotiating her way out of a paper bag, yet she puts herself through this punishment over and over again. May is a useless prime minister, who has not achieved a single thing of note during her premiership apart from present a bizarre capitulation to the EU called her Chequers BRINO (Brexit in name only) deal. “It was embarrassing watching this sad woman, she knows she is betraying Britain, and even though we want to stiff your country, we hold no love to someone who willingly betrays and lies to their own people. Has she no shame?” another EUcrat revealed. The desperation May has displayed in her so-called negotiation is sickening to watch. She may take her orders from Olly Robbins, the Remainer in charge of orchestrating this farcical sham, but surely this is no way to negotiate anything. One must have a position of strength, and be willing to walk away if there is a bad deal put forward, yet May persists in her shameless sickly desperate attempts. Has the great nation of Britain come to this? Please, we beg someone, or something to remove this awful sad sight. It is truly upsetting, and distressing to see this once strong country reduced to begging desperately and willing to take any piece of scrap thrown by the EU. Stand up! Get out! Leave! But do not extend this awful show of cowardice, treachery, and disgusting desperation. If the EU does not want a deal, then let it be. One cannot bang one’s head against a wall for eternity. Oust this duplicitous pathetic loser, and her treacherous minions, and let us have a Clean Brexit. This is the only way forward now. No more begging please. Just get her out and put someone in who can manage the Clean Brexit, and move on. For fuck’s sake, how hard can that be?",1
"You ever been so shit scared to watch a movie that you literally have to be pulled into the theatre? ‘Attack of the NPC Hordes’ is one of those movies. This is what it was like when they gave me a ticket to review this movie. Let’s just say that to watch this film you need a stomach of steel, and nipple clamps hooked up to a 100 volt battery to keep you awake. The film was directed by up and coming director NPC, produced by NPC, and the stars of the film were NPC, and NPC. We also get a great cameo role by none other than NPC. CNNPC gave it 5 stars out of 5, and so did MSNPC. According to the blurb, the film was heavily funded by the #NPCToo and NPCLivesMatter N-P-C organisations. The opening scene brings forth a wall to wall NPC crowd all chanting the same thing. Over and over again, the same words are chanted by the NPCs. Hundreds of thousands of them all with the same NPC chant, and the same NPC face, and the same NPC march. This scene lasts for over two hours as they chant the same old mantras that these brainwashed NPCs like to do on a constant basis. This nightmarish film depicts a dystopian world where brainwashed drone-like NPCs led by their programmers, who are never seen, shout out their Marxist communist mantras to all and sundry. They do not know why they are doing what they are doing, but they do it anyway. They are basically mindless angry soulless automatons roaming the streets and shouting at the top of their lungs, without any knowledge of why they are angry in the first place. Frankly after the fourth hour of watching the NPCs marching up and down, chanting “No Fascist USA K – K – K!” I literally wanted to shave my eyeballs with a rusty razor and poke my scrotum with knitting needles just to escape this vapid, brainless, banal idiocy. At one point the NPCs started a ‘rape’ chant. “All men are rapists!” By then I decided to toss my popcorn and upturn my iced drink over my head. Another four hours of NPCs screaming about the ‘patriarchy’ and ‘white males’ got me into a cold sweat. I fled the room, I felt dehumanized by the chanting. I could not take anymore. I was lucky I was in Portland, Oregon, where these kind of things never happen in reality. That is, until I stepped outside the cinema straight into a….

"T he times when one needed to travel to a dedicated physical place in order to be able to gamble are long gone. The advent of the Internet has brought entertainment to our door, or rather, to our screens. The same is true about online casinos, that can nowadays be easily accessed within a second in our browsers or through dedicated software. The Advent Of Online Gambling If you are new to online gambling, it might be rather useful to get adjusted with the types of software by trying some free online slots. With online slot machines, you won’t need much practice given that the principles behind them are fairly simple. Afterward, you can try your luck and win real money in online casinos, where all the stakes are real just like the thrill. Regardless of your level of experience, it is always essential to exercise caution when choosing betting amounts and to keep your impulses under control. How To Choose Your Casino Among the things you should keep in mind when choosing an online casino or game are the following: Chances of winning. With many types of games, especially with online slot machines, it is very easy to do some very simple math in order to learn about the winning chances. The fact that the odds of winning are rather easy to grasp and the rules are very simple and straightforward makes it the preferred type of gambling game, with about 70% of the income in an average US casino coming from this type of machines. In order to get a grasp of the winning chances or the principles behind more complex games, one could look for more information online or on dedicated forum pages. The payout percentage. This is essentially the amount of money that a slot returns to winners divided by the amount that it takes from all the bets. Typically, the payout percentage for a slot machine varies between 75 and 98%. Obviously, the casino needs some profit in order to be motivated to operate the business, however, some casinos are more generous than the others. One should always remember that a higher payout percentage results in greater jackpots or in more winning chances (depending on the game) because more money is left for the players. The amount of jackpot. Obviously, if one is to gamble, there must be a motivation. While some games have a fixed jackpot, others would increase it with time (progressive jackpot). While betting for a lower jackpot is a less attractive idea, keep in mind that higher jackpots attract more players and, depending on the game, winning chances for an individual might be decreasing if more players are participating. Look out for the types of devices supported – for instance, if you only used to play the game on your smartphone, make sure that the casino has an app for it before signing up and loading money to your balance. Fortunately, top online casinos normally support multiple operating systems and devices. Payment alternatives. To be able to bet money or make attempts with the various gaming software, you would need to load the money with a payment system convenient for you: be it a bank card, like Mastercard or Visa, or an online payment system, like Skrill. Many platforms would even accept bitcoins. By contrast with traditional gambling, online gambling is beyond any geographical restrictions and schedule restrictions, with cases of people winning the jackpot online even during conference calls at work. Sometimes luck just needs an additional chance.",1
"Stormy Daniels One must feel for poor old Stormy Daniels, here she was expecting a massive extra pay-off from the Trump team, and vindication for her ‘claim’ that she was threatened by a man wearing a wooly hat, but now has to pay off massive legal fees after being stumped by the judge. “I gotta get back to work. Been practicing my guzzling, and moaning. You know that fake moaning that the female performers have to do to pretend they’re actually having fun being pistoned insanely by some meth-eyed roid-muscled meathead with a crew cut and a viagra’d member that resembles a huge GMO eggplant.” Yes, and to add insult to injury, the $580,000 odd raised at Stormy’s GoFundMe site will no doubt go to Mr. Trump’s team. This effectively means, that the dumb socialists who funded Stormy are giving the money to Trump.

"The EU Referendum was the biggest democratic vote in British history with a 72% voter turnout on June 23, 2016. Leave voters voted to LEAVE ALL OF THE EU, not selective parts, or small pieces of it…ALL OF IT! There were two boxes to tick for the EU Referendum, one option was Stay in the EU, the other was to Leave the EU. By ticking the Leave EU box, that meant leaving the EU, and ALL of its entities. That meant leaving the EU Customs Union, leaving the European Court of Justice, leaving the Single Market, leaving every single part of the EU. The EU referendum and the result to leave taken on June 23, 2016 is the only important date that should be focused on. What has happened since that date is completely inconsequential and unimportant. In fact, NOTHING has occurred of any note since June 23, 2016. Now if nothing happens on a continued basis, then 17,410,742 voters will MAKE something happen by visiting Number 10, Downing Street. We will all expect a cup of tea from Mrs May and her Remainer friends, and then 17,410,742 voters will ask her nicely why we are not out of the EU, and why she wants to keep us in the EU, and what the fuck is she going to do about it? If there is no answer after the 17,410,742 voters speak, then 17,410,742 voters will not be very happy, in fact they will be quite upset, more so after waiting for two years for nothing. I mean, if democracy does not count for anything anymore in Britain, what does? Does Mrs. May want 17,410,742 angry voters to turn up on the doorstep of Number 10?",1
"The royal family and its bloodlines have been changed forever after centuries of pure Anglo-Saxon breeding. Congratulations are to be given to Harry and Meghan, who today announced the arrival soon of the first ever black baby into the undiluted royal bloodline. “Harry and Meghan are pioneers in the history of European royalty. Never before has the African genetic bloodline been introduced to any European royal family throughout the whole of history. Prince Harry must be truly proud of himself for breaking the mould to introduce those African genes into European royal circles with his new wife, the beautiful Meghan,” royal historian Alan Starksy, told the BBC. How will the Saxe-Coburg Gotha genetic lineage deal with the introduction of the African genetic bloodline? Geneticist Dr. Werner Andrell, from the Institute of Genetic Global Research in Lausanne, Switzerland, revealed some interesting points about the new royal arrival. “Colour of the skin does not matter, because to say it does is completely racist and unacceptable. It is however fully possible through the generational transfer of genes that the baby will be fully black, maybe only taking a few attributes from Prince Harry like his ginger hair although with negroid characteristics. Some genetic traits can skip whole generations and suddenly appear seemingly out of nowhere. There are also certain traits related to African genes, like Sickle cell anemia, and genetics relating to temperament, like the ability to dance rhythmically in time to music, as well as the ability to rap and run fast. The grandmother, an African American has lineage from the slave days of old, and this will ensure the ability of the child to endure hardships easily, as all these genetic traits pass through generationally.” Disgusting stereotypes of African Americans, like their supposed extremely low IQ, propensity to steal, and commit savage acts of violence as well as their constant angry attitude should be dispelled with the new arrival as he/she will be brought up amidst the highest luxury, privilege and educated in the most prestigious institutions. Here’s to the wonderful news, the royal family must be so happy, and are now surfing the crest of an amazing wave of good publicity. ",1
"Fart enthusiasts, and connoisseurs have attended the museum since its opening in 1953, and this year, there is a celebration of 150 years of bottled farts, at the world renowned museum. Situated in the leafy Brussels address of 41 Rue de la Loi, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium, international visitors to the museum number in the millions every year, to explore the fascinating world of farting. Curator of the museum, Monsieur Connard Raseur, welcomes initiates to the world famous Fart Museum to enjoy the sounds and smells of farts dating back 150 years. Brussels Sprouts “Today, we are celebrating 150 years of flatulation, or farts. We are truly honoured to have the president of the EU, Jean Claude Juncker, attend the celebration, where he will sniff a fart from 1937, and give us his verdict on its vintage quality. The EU grant of 350 million euros last year was greatly appreciated. We have also heard he is a particular expert in farting himself, and enjoys nothing more than to distribute cognac tempered Brussels sprout farts whilst in the EU Commission elevator filled with secretaries. Monsieur Juncker, will be invited to inter one of his famous farts as a special treat to visitors and many generations to come.” When one enters the fart museum they are instantly amazed at the amount of bottled farts exhibited. “We have bottled farts extending all the way back to 1868. C’est merveilleux. The fart from that particular year was preserved in quite a large bottle, and is still perfectly sniffable. According to our museum records it was presented to the museum by the family of a German gentleman of the era, his name, Heinrich Furz, is clearly written on the bottle label. His fart was preserved after he had ingested a meal of Königsberger Klopse, some Spätzle, and a large portion of Stollen, washed down with copious amounts of strong Bavarian ale. “One of our most interesting farts is found from a bottle sealed and labelled in 1964. This vintage fart was produced from an old lady who at the time lived in a house on rue De L’abreuvoir, where she sold her farts as an aphrodisiac to Parisian gentlemen frequenting the local bordel, where the filles de joie would work day and night. It is said that Pablo Picasso, was a particularly frequent visitor to the Madam’s salon where he sniffed away the peculiar aroma to his heart’s content. Visitors to the Fart Museum can also sniff vintage farts that are available on any particular day. For example on Tuesdays, the museum labels it ladies day, and tourists can sniff the female scented rosey farts backdated 150 years. One visitor from Ohio, USA has visited the museum hundreds of times and is today sniffing a fart from 1945. “There was a certain aftertaste to the nasal palate. An austere aromatic almond smell, resonating with embellishments of beefy farmyard blackcurrant tones furnished with strains of hydrogen sulphide suggesting a smattering of bad eggs mixed slightly with the heady bouquet of chaptalised cat’s urine. One of the more unique farts I have smelled. Let me have a look at the bottle, ah, this one was siphoned from the asshole of a Vichy collaborator governmental official who had recently been captured after the second world war had ended. Marvelous, I would never have guessed.” To celebrate 150 years of farts, the museum is giving away a small bottle of vintage fart gas to every visitor who comes to the museum from the dates of 15 October to January 5th 2019. Tickets: 15 euros Opening hours: 09.30-20.00 Monday-Friday, 11.20-15.00 Saturday-Sunday Fart Museum (Musée de Péter), 41 Rue de la Loi, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium",1
"E veryone can identify a hipster from a mile away. The de facto hipster uniform consists of a flannel shirt (the looser the fit, the better), a pair of suspenders, and a pair of Converse trainers or Doc Martens boots (bonus points if they’re seriously beat-up). But have you ever stopped to wonder why that shifty-looking young person became a hipster in the first place? Have you ever asked them to put down their can of Pabst Blue Ribbon (the hipster drink of choice), to actually have a conversation with them? We’re guessing that the answer to those questions is no. If you had, you may be surprised with what they’d tell you. Hipsters are Just Unemployed Lumberjacks What our research has brought to light is that it’s no coincidence that the clothing worn by hipsters just happens to be the exact same uniform that lumberjacks wear to work each day. Hipsters are just unemployed lumberjacks, left out of work due to the shift to a digital age, where people don’t need such primitive tools such as notebooks and paper for printers because they have notes apps on their mobiles, and emails. There’s not even a need for books any more since e-readers like the Amazon Kindle are en vogue, letting everyone everywhere squint at screens to get their Harry Potter fix or that oh-so-scandalous fanfic that turned into a light BDSM franchise. And it’s not just fiction books that are going out of style either. Bingo halls have even ditched their paper bingo books, with the Buzz Bingo bingo club chain adopting electronic tablets inside of its venues. Just to add salt to the wounds of these poor, out-of-work woodcutters, there are even bingo apps that let people play on the go. Sales of print newspapers are declining, meaning your fish and chips will no longer be flavoured by the tangy, metallic taste of printer ink. And who needs magazines when you’ve got your Facebook newsfeed anyway, and who cares that it’s full of targeted advertising and malicious trolls paid by shady groups? Will Lumberjacks Ever Get Their Jobs Back? But it’s not all bad news for the humble hipster either! They needn’t sit around figuring out how to make their fixie bikes startup take off or trying to hawk rotary phones to passersby on the street (never eBay, that’s far too mainstream). There are plenty of alternatives to keep lumberjacks in work. For example, they could go overseas and become the Brawny mascot, being the official face of kitchen roll and wet wipes everywhere! But come to think of it, as the paper towel brand is known for its products lasting a while, this could potentially put other lumberjacks out of business. Other top career suggestions include being a software engineer, a human resources manager, or a financial planner. Why not become a master coder and make your own apps? Or drag unruly employees back into line? A financial planner would also be a fun job so long as you can count, or if you know the basic functions of a calculator! And while these careers are not hipster-friendly nor does lumberjacking offer any transferable skills that would help in these jobs, given that lumberjacking is considered one of the worst jobs you can do, and software engineer/HR manager and financial planner are considered some of the best, we’d say that it’s a considerable step up. Don’t be sad, hipsters of the world. Felling trees isn’t the only career out there!",1
"L ots of users confront similar errors every day because their applications fail to find the essential run-time components.

When the program successfully uninstalled, make sure to perform its installation again.",1
"One rarely gets a glimpse into the machinations of the concept of collapsing, the intermittent process of deconstruction or the faltering shaky atmosphere before it all ends with a big thud on the sofa of eternity. The atmospherics of Daria Geller, an upcoming director of photography and filmographer, are all too apparent with her new fashion video entitled Collapsology. The cinematography is borne from the lens of this talented Russian beauty, who now resides in Israel and Paris, a powerful mix of destinations to formulate her art. Shaking, rhythmic camera sweeps, and lens filters bring forth a torrent of uneasy motion as the dim lodgings of decaying post-Soviet Russia come into view. Watching the video, there is a touch of Danny Boyle, Trainspotting going on, and maybe some Abel Ferrara added into the mix. We’re not sure what type of fashion item this video could sell, but its style is most certainly within the expensive perfume niche. One can imagine a Parisienne lady enchanted by the dramatics in the video, instantly going to her local perfumerie to slap on the scent of Collapsology against her delicate silken pale neck, as long as there is no Novichok involved..(bad joke). What does this video say about Russian, English relationships, yes they are fiery, but as the acting collapses into bitter words from the Russian model, the English model collapses with resignation back into her arms? It is clearly a love hate relationship, and the confused overlapping dialogue suggests that collapsing is sometimes bad, and good at the same time.",1
"Nothing ever comes easy in life, one has to fight for every little scrap, whether it is the last morsel of food in a family of ten children, or that elusive A grade in an exam, or that job application where thousands have applied. Freedom, and the right to free speech is much the same, but this concept is the hardest fought battle, for there are many who seek to remove this human right from our table. There are many today who actively seek to remove the rights our forefathers fought for to the death, and these enemies of freedom are working in concert to completely erase hundreds of years of work in one fell swoop. Just as our forefathers fought for freedom, there will come a time soon when many will say enough is enough, and they will too wake up to what is going on. The insipid totalitarian tiptoe of soviet communist ideology which seeks to remove our Western democratic freedoms by uttering their Newspeak. Utilising selective keywords to describe their purge of free expression; anything that is not their ideology is thus deemed as ‘hate speech’, and anything that questions their robotic Orwellian narrative is called ‘fake news’. These linguistic terms can be used to remove anything they want, and without any recourse or explanation, such is their anti-freedom fervour. The underhand tactics for removing freedom of speech, is one that has been utilised many times in Soviet countries of the past and present, in the USSR, in East Germany, and in Maoist China. Soviet creations like feminism, and political correctness are also a tool used to undermine free speech and freedom. Unfortunately for those who value freedom, these communistic forces reside in much of the media and Silicon Valley. Infiltrated — the higher echelons of government, and the intelligence agencies, work in consortium with the communist sympathising media elements and tech conglomerates to purge all forms of dissent of the Soviet communist ideology to which they subscribe to. Communism is now pushed in American universities, and British universities as the only way forward, even though this totalitarian political ideology has been responsible for over 160 million deaths throughout history with its great purges. The youth of today are being thus trained as ‘Comrades’ and ‘Bolshevik’ fighters, who abhor freedom of speech, privacy or any form of individualism. They instead only support the collectivist mantras spoken by their Marxist professors, who send these brainwashed robots into the world to prepare them for the coming attempt to eradicate democracy, freedom and capitalism. Thomas Jefferson once said: “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” What the ‘useful idiots’ do not know, however is that if they were to take full control and complete their mission of installing a full communist state, they themselves would be purged, in the first instance. This is what communists do, the higher echelons of the communist structure, order the deaths of all who helped them get into power, for a very simple reason, they have been tricked into believing the ideology in full, and are thus deemed dangerous, because if they feel betrayed in anyway, they will turn on their leaders, and the hierarchy does not want that threat looming over them. To stop this communist takeover, which has unfortunately infected much of the previously moderate left-wing media, the fight will be long and arduous, and those who value freedom, will have to have help from those in government who value freedom as well. From the lowest point to the highest point of government, we must have your assurance that you will do everything you can to clean the swamp, to eradicate the Marxists from their positions of power, to extricate their funding, to devalue their anti-freedom push, and to disable their methods of undermining our inherent rights to free speech. The biggest threat, of course to the West today is China, and its Maoist ideology has infiltrated the West, including the left-wing tech media companies. One search engine monopoly is even working on a Chinese censored search engine, which they will use as a model to infiltrate the Western model. One social media company has a devout communist CEO, who even speaks Mandarin, and has married a Chinese wife. He has been completely indoctrinated in Maoist communist ideology, and is seeking to expand his already large empire into China. This will involve more censorship and the disavowment of democracy, free speech. The EU, is another major threat to freedom. This is a totalitarian entity that has already impacted on freedom of speech and utilises its economic might to force nations to comply with its communist collectivist ideologies. This anti-democratic state is run solely by unelected officials in the EU Commission. In Britain today, there is a big fight going on to extricate the UK from this un-democratic authoritarian manifestation, and to bring back Britain’s sovereign free status, as well as its freedom to make its own laws, and conduct its own trade deals. The fight is further compounded by the communist voices within the UK who are trying to thwart Britain’s exit. The sheer depth of the infiltration of these communist operative into the West is immense, and it will possibly take many decades to fight for our freedoms, that our forefathers fought for all those years ago. “Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government: When this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved.” Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. If you don’t want your children, their children, and their grandchildren, to live in a totalitarian communist dictatorship where there is no freedom of speech, freedom of expression, then you must act now, you must make your voice heard, vote those who subscribe to socialist communist ideologies out of office, deny the socialist power by not using their services, boycott those who deny freedom by censoring, and you must ultimately help those who wish to change this communistic creep that is setting in on our once Western democratic free society by fighting with all of your might to get rid of them once and for all. Once we lose that right to free speech…it’s never coming back…that’s it…gone. “If men are to be precluded from offering their sentiments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences that can invite the consideration of mankind, reason is of no use to us; the freedom of speech may be taken away, and dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the slaughter.” — George Washington, first U.S. president",1
"Don’t worry folks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 831.83 points lower today at 25,598.74. The Nasdaq Composite skipped a few steps down by 4 percent to 7,422.05 and the S&P 500 dropped like a fucking concrete block by 3.3 percent to 2,785.68, with the tech sector pulling the index under like an anchor tossed into the Atlantic ocean. These are early days yet, because we still have a 60% drop to contend with. So, what’s causing all this stuff to happen? Well, there are multiple variables causing the little drops. The main issue is of course China, who are not playing ball with Trump’s tariff changes. The Chinese are intent on bringing some chaos to the U.S. markets utilising underhand methods, after Trump trumped their easy money-making deals where they were stiffing America with unfair trade deals. Let’s say, there’s the dumping of U.S. bonds, as China is pretty much the largest holder of U.S. debt, and there’s the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports into China. This whole clusterfuck puts a strain on manufacturers and companies on both sides. Wherever there is China, there is always Russia, and the sanctions put on the country by the U.S., EU, and UK, have created a deeper alliance with the Chinese economically, as well as politically. Then we have the U.S. tech companies colluding with each other to censor everything on the internet that is not socialist, or communist. This action has reawakened a serious investigation into anti-trust regulation, which will break-up many of these monopoly companies who have misused their positions of power for the gain of the socialist movement in America. Regulators are already prepping to proceed with slapping these companies with serious fines and regulations, as well as breaking the bigger ones up into smaller manageable sizes. These are just a few variables, we have mentioned, as there are many more, like rate rises, but we don’t want to write this shit all day. Grumble, whisper…martial law…Capitol Hill arrests for treason…Silicon Valley arrests for corruption/meddling with elections…whisper…whisper..cleaning the swamp..FBI/CIA insiders…midterms..etc.. The simplest way to describe the situation is, everything that goes up, must come down one day, and certainly, that day is coming soon. Cash out now before it’s too late, buy gold bullion, like the real gold bars, the physical stuff. Paper money won’t be worth the paper it’s printed on after this.",1
"One thing for us over the pond, that we find strange, is the term used for the American socialist party, the Democrats, named as “Liberals”. The term liberal, in a political sense suggests someone who is “favouring individual liberty, free trade, and moderate political and social reform.” However, to see what the so-called ‘liberals’ are doing in America as of late, is profoundly ‘illiberal’ and extremist. That is to say, they are the antithesis of what they say they are, and have somehow metamorphosed into a totalitarian, authoritarian Marxist political ideology, befitting soviet communism in many ways. We can see this with the coordinated anti-free speech movement of the American socialists within monopoly tech and media companies, and the move further left, with massive censorship and cutting off the voice of millions of people who do not hold extreme leftist political ideals, as well as the attempted destruction of the right for citizens to defend themselves with arms, enshrined in the American constitution. The extreme left of the democratic party, not only wants to destroy the rights of Americans to speak freely, but to destroy their rights to defend themselves with arms, as well as their right to fair election by denying other political ideologies a voice in a free stable level playing field platform where all forms of political ideology and speech are allowed. The democrat party members and offshoots, like ANTIFA and BlackLivesMatter have also advocated violent internal-terroristic action against any other political ideology that does not adhere to their extreme Marxist viewpoint. These people still call themselves ‘liberals’ but to watch them aggressively beating up old frail men at protests who dare to hold up their placards and pepper spraying them in the face is far from any set of defined liberal attitude but one of the the out of control mob. The ‘liberals’ today do not value freedom of expression or speech, they do not value capitalism or democracy, they do not value the right of citizens to defend themselves from harm, they do not believe in individualism, and they do not value nation states controlling borders for security purposes. What we see from today’s American socialists today is a movement that is bolstered by communist ideology, utilising the disenchanted youth, minorities, and illegal migrants to impose their extremist Marxist viewpoint onto everything and everyone in a totalitarian manner. Through violence, aggression, censorship and authoritarian measures, American socialists have soiled their own so-called ‘inclusive’, ‘progressive’ status to become extremists utilising any means possible, legal or illegal to push forward the sovietized programming they have all received. Our observation, form afar, is one out of the box, and is profoundly unbiased as we do not hold any political ideology, left, centre, or right. We are mere observers, who see things as they truly are, almost like a mirror image, and we report what we see as truth. Let us hope one day the American ‘liberals’ find liberalism.",1
"Instead of punishing people by raising taxes on income and raiding pension pots, to raise £20 Billion for the NHS, why not not pay the £39 Billion EU ransom money to Brussels and use it on the UK? There is of course no logic to how the current Remainer Chancellor of the Exchequer works, because he is so blinded by his hatred of Brexit, and Brexiteers. “The conservatives, in the past were for lower taxes, however because we are now adopting socialist New Labour practices, and Remainer politics, our main modus operandi is to punish the voter. We wish to punish the Brexit voters, not only in a vindictive sense, but as a greater part of Project Fear which has been running since the EU Referendum. Our masters in Brussels give me my orders daily and I follow these orders without question. I also follow orders from Olly Robbins, who has now take over Brexit negotiations to make it the softest Brexit we can possibly have, in other words, it will be Brexit only in name,” Philip Hammond told the Financial Times today. All of this of course serves as due notice, that many will abandon the Conservatives in the next election. This Brexit budget punishment compounded with a Brexit betrayal by the Remainer controlled Cabinet and Whitehall, will ensure the Conservatives do not sniff power for decades. Contempt of the electorate and democracy “It is certainly a rebuff to the Brexit voters by punishing the electorate with such a budget. This vindictive nasty behaviour is however quite natural for Remainers like Philip Hammond and his ilk. It is to be expected, as they do not seem to care that the electorate and grassroots never forget the indignities foisted on them by these pathetic lowly traitors to Britain,” one MP said in parliament. Amongst the so-called Brexiteers in parliament, there has only been mostly silence, and a few whimpers of dissent, otherwise they’re towing the party line, kept in step by the whips, cracking away on their yellow spines. The stench of urine and faeces now permeates the halls of the House of Commons and Lords, as they are a place bereft of democracy, and now completely taken over by the soviet totalitarian forces of the EU, usurping Britain’s sovereign status indefinitely, and enabled by the vile traitors within the wheels of government.",1
"We pay for our own chains After stealing the private data of billions of people, and being caught committing many acts of corruption, Facebook wants you to install an Orwellian Facebook Portal telescreen in your home which will follow you around wherever you go. This Facebook device with a camera and listening device may one day have to be installed in every home as a compulsory measure, but for now, it is being introduced as a voluntary purchasable option. Yeah! As if anyone would be mad enough to trust a company that actively accesses users private data, and sells it to any government agency or business that wants it. Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. What kind of a moron would pay for their own surveillance? Well, there are many millennials today, who will no doubt be queuing round the block to purchase this portal, but this is completely understandable because many are vapid, illiterates who know nothing about Orwell, or privacy for that matter. This is why they still keep a Facebook page even after it admitted fully to misusing their private data for profit. The millennials have been conditioned to accept every indignity, to abhor freedom, to abhor privacy, and to obey their master controllers at all cost. Not only do they know what you are thinking these days but they also want to know what you are doing and saying when off the internet, in your own home. The dystopian nightmare we are all living in today, is way worse than George Orwell ever dreamed about whilst writing 1984 in his little Scottish shack. In fact, if Orwell were ever to see the nightmare of today, he would cringe and cry out at its sheer vulgarity and utter disregard for the human soul. For what we have become is part of a hive mind that exists in a cold hard digital shell that infects and probes every part of the human condition, rendering it null and void of any humanity after it has completely enveloped you and exercised its digital wrath upon your very being. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called. The tech wizards who are complicit in this tortuous exercise of enslavement are the harbingers of an authoritarian, totalitarian scientific dictatorship, that not only Orwell would have balked at, but add in Bertrand Russell and Aldous Huxley into the mix. Every home will soon have to have a telescreen (Facebook Portal) and you will not be able to escape the prying eyes of your masters as they track your every move online, or your smartphone, or the screen watching and listening to you in your own home. Many today, cannot turn off their smartphones for one second, so it is inevitable that they will soon accept these Facebook Portal devices into their homes as well. It is only a matter of time. He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. No doubt, in the future, if there is a reason for any recall, the authorities will simply be able to pinpoint a thing you said at home, and use that as evidence against you, especially one supposes if you are running for public office or are linked to any business, or lower governmental agency. The courts will be filled with video evidence of whatever crime was committed, and the lead up to that certain crime. If you utter an expletive against the government at home, this will be logged, if you show any form of dissent towards the faction in control, this will be logged as ‘hate speech’ and you will eventually find yourself taken away in the dark hours of the night, never to be seen again. Today, many are caught out by their words on social media, and they have paid the price by losing their jobs, their livelihoods, their family and ultimately their lives. Twitter death can come easily, as you can be arrested and put in a cell in the same afternoon you penned that certain tweet. Suffice to say, anyone who trusts certain nefarious tech companies and what they can do to you are idiots who possibly deserve everything that comes to them. Nineteen Eighty Four was nothing next to the shit that is going on today..nothing.",1
"F ootball has taken a dramatic twist from being a mere sport for entertainment to become a money making an enterprise. For the past two decades football has become more than a sport, rather it has become a business. It’s not only a business to the club owners but to players as well. The rewards are even bigger than the jackpot prizes on most progressive online slots at top us online casinos. However, the main focus of this article is on football owners who have become rich by investing large chunks of their money into reputable football clubs. Investing in football clubs with a very good history of winning trophies and that generate high profits is what investors look at. Some of these business people invest in a football club due to the fact that they are a long supporter of the club. To appreciate the men behind the so-called successful clubs let’s take a look at some of the richest club owners in the world. Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed AL Nahyan – $34 Billion After taking over the English football club Manchester City in 2008, the club has gone to perform extremely well. Sheikh Mansour has managed to invest his money in signing new players at the club and he also invested in building Manchester City a new training field centre. His ambitions have managed to attract many big name players to play for Manchester City. Since he took over the club has won three League titles and three FA Cups. Sheikh also magnified his investments in buying MLS franchise, New York City and Aussie Club Melbourne City. George Soros – $24 Billion- Manchester United George Soros is the head of the Soros Fund Management one of the most popular hedge funds in the world. Soros became a billionaire in 1992 after he acquired $1 Billion in a single day by trading the British pound during the catastrophic Black Wednesday. He later invested some of his money in football after signing a mega-deal to acquire DC United. He later decided to expand his fortunes and he became a minority shareholder in Manchester United until he became the majority shareholder owner. He has transformed the Red Devils to be dominant in England and in Europe. The club has won many European Cups and Premier leagues under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson. ",1
"Apparently Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who who was critical of the current regime in Saudi Arabia, walked into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and er..never walked out. No one saw him exit the consulate, least his fiancee who was patiently waiting outside. The Saudis conjured up a story that he somehow exited the consulate without being seen by anyone. Was he a practitioner of Ninjistsu, or did he acquire an invisibility blanket a la Harry Potter? The Turks, have another theory, which is much more gruesome, according to a police official, he was “brutally tortured, killed and cut into pieces” inside the consulate after visiting the building on 2 October. Other theories floating about, is that the pieces of meat were taken out in shifts, and sold to nearby kebab shops as lamb. “I just enjoyed a great doner kebab. There was only one problem, I found some identity papers in the kebab written in Arabic, with some Saudi guy on the photo. The kebab was delicious, so I thought nothing of it and put the papers in the bin after I finished my fantastic meal,” an Australian tourist revealed yesterday. The search for the poor fellow goes on.. ",1
"The charade of back and forth of the Brexit deal has been tiresome, and so transparent that it is an obvious fix. Theresa May, the treacherous liar that she is, drafted the deal with Angela Merkel and Brussels eurocrats on the 5th and 6th of July before she presented to her Cabinet at Chequers on 7 July. Brussels eurocrats know that the deal is already accepted but have conducted the necessary refusals of the contract. May was seen to be sorely disgusted and alone at her treatment by the Brussels mafia on 20 September in Salzburg. This was all a charade. Next up comes Tusk with a declaration that he suddenly wants to do a Canada plus plus super duper deal. Then everything goes quiet. Then, to compound things, Theresa May suddenly starts preparations with her whips to bribe Labour MPs to push her Chequers BRINO plan through parliament bypassing the DUP, and Conservative Brexiteer MPs. May’s superiors in Brussels will seek more capitulations and then will publicly accept the deal which was accepted in July, so May can get the deal pushed through her parliament by using Labour MPs to bypass and betray her own party. This duplicitous machiavellian approach by May not only insults the people who voted to get out of the EU on June 23, 2016, but it insults the sovereign, and Britain’s democratic values. Theresa May campaigned strongly for Remain during the EU Referendum – photo – Twitter Theresa May’s BRINO Chequers plan will tie Britain into the Customs Union indefinitely, and will severely limit the UK doing any trade deals with the rest of the world. During this time, Theresa May has been dishonest, committed treason, lied to the electorate, and misled parliament as well as her own MPs, causing many to leave in disgust. If this is not grounds for her removal, then there is no justice, democracy or sovereignty in Britain today. By pushing through her Chequers BRINO plan through parliament utilising Labour MPs, May is betraying and abusing the electorate and whole system of governmental parliamentary politics with her totalitarian forced ‘Brexit In Name Only’ Brussels penned plan. No Brexiteer will ever vote Conservative again. After this, perversion of the electoral system and debasement of democracy, the Tories will be out of power for thirty to forty years.",1
"The rights of women, we fully respect them. If some scumbag abuses a woman, they should get what’s coming to them and then some. The only line we think should not be crossed is if a man is accused of something, then paraded in front of the mob and pronounced guilty without due process. C’mon everyone deserves a right to have their story heard, and by law this is the right thing to do, especially when there have been many documented cases of these vindictive schemers lying about assault, for whatever reason. Men don’t like to see any female hurt in any way, so it kind of smarts when you see some women, who obviously hate men, saying on Twitter or whatever social media site that they want ‘all men killed’. Has it got to that point that a woman would say that? Extreme radicalised soviet feminists are now advocating that all male babies should be killed. No doubt, for thousands of years, women have had the short end of the stick, and have had to endure terrible suffering, however, today in the West, they are pretty much top of the chain. There still needs some work to be done on equal pay, that is granted, but many businesses and institutions are now headed by women. It is in the developing world where work needs to be done to stop the disgusting practice of genital mutilation, and forced marriage, as well as slavery. Why don’t the socialist feminists in the West who hate men so much care about their sisters in the countries where young girls are forced to have their genitals mutilated? The Western feminists do not seem to care, possibly because those other women are predominantly coloured.

Granted many of those filmed were paid workers for Soros affiliated groups, but there were many women present, young and old who followed these manipulative instigators without so much of a question. Women, what have you done to yourselves? You should be celebrating your triumphs. It is young men now who are the downtrodden class, forgotten, left to rot in their misery, suicidal. More young men are committing suicide now than ever before, why is that? Women are now top of university league tables, top of exam results, and employed more than men. Schools and hospitals are primarily run by women, and the UK has its second female prime minister. All commerce is now geared towards the female. Women are succeeding in business, in academics, in all fields, so why is there still so much anguish? We know not all women are bitter radical feminists who want all men murdered in cold blood, but the decent women who are within society should also raise their voices sometimes to stop these deranged radicals once in awhile. This bitterness and hatred must stop.",1
"Saturday was a great day in the fight against communism and Marxism in America when Brett Kavanaugh was instated as a judge at the Supreme Court. The vilification of an innocent man for the purposes of political gain, and the unjust smearing of Brett Kavanaugh should be seen as a national disgrace, and never allowed to happen ever again. This was a great day for America, because it is one step to taking back the country from a political ideology that was practically taking over every governmental institution and every media outlet and has been growing for over eight years under the previous president. Naturally, the hysterical squawking militant communists are now jumping up and down in their soiled diapers, but one day, they may grow up and act like civilised adults, although that is highly unlikely. This was a great day for justice, and for the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. The communist mobs did not feel that way and tried their hardest to condemn an innocent person without trial or any form of concrete evidence. The highlight of the whole sordid affair was of course Senator Lindsey Graham, who encapsulated much of the disgust we all felt by watching this charade, this sham unfold its ugly wings and present itself to the world. America won! The anti-American commies lost! We must also remember that both sides are ultimately controlled by the same entity, however, for theatre’s sake, let us sweep that little truth under the carpet for now.",1
"Interpol President Meng Hongwei, 64, has mysteriously disappeared in China Chinese communist officials have denied ever seeing Interpol chief, Meng Hongwei, 64, who was last seen leaving for China in late September from the Interpol headquarters in Lyon, southeast France. “Meng who? We never seen anyone like that? Here let me check. No!” one official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied when asked about the Interpol chief. Hongwei arrived in China and has disappeared it seems, and no one knows where he is. One reporter from a French news agency even went to the offices of the Ministry of Public Security where Hongwei is vice-minister. The last report from the reporter was sent yesterday: “I asked the authorities whether they had seen Meng Hongwei, the president of Interpol. The officials said they had never heard of him, and threatened to arrest me.” Since yesterday, French press agency RTF have lost contact with their reporter, who has also disappeared as well as the Interpol president. Interpol has downplayed the concerns, saying the president has little influence over the organisation’s day-to-day operations, which are handled by secretary-general Juergen Stock. The agency do not plan on looking for their president because they are too scared of the Chinese and have little or no power in China.

"As much as the #MeToo mob has condemned every form of sexual behaviour by human males as rape, it has now turned its eye onto the animal kingdom and wants to change things there as well. “It is not enough power for us that we can make an allegation after thirty or forty years and ruin a man’s life from some unsubstantiated made-up statement that can never be legally proven, because we know, women never lie, and men are all rapists to be condemned to live the rest of their sorry lives as social pariahs and lepers,” former ‘comedienne’, Amy Schumer, told MSNBC on Friday. “#MeToo women do not only detest human males and their toxic masculinity, we also hate the animal kingdom’s males. Did you know that those cute fish y’all love called dolphins display disgusting male sexist behaviour? It’s disgusting and we have to stop it. I was speaking to a oceanologist and she told me that it is common practice for young male dolphins to work as a team to separate single female dolphins from their group, take her to a secluded area, and take turns mating with her.” #MeToo activists are now planning to police the waters of the Pacific ocean by patrolling schools of dolphins and if they see that kind of behaviour, will immediately intervene to push the males away and some even advocate a form of punishment towards male dolphins. It’s not just male dolphins that have received the wrath of #MeToo activists, the Bonobo Chimpanzee male displays deeply disturbing sexist traits that have made activists very angry. “We heard that these male Bonobo chimps, they have orgies, this is where they pick any female in the group excluding the alpha female and have sex with them. The female chimps are all submissive and cannot say no, they just fall in line and enjoy the fun. This is one of the most disgusting forms of sexism we have ever heard of. We want to conduct an expedition to the Congo next year where we will intervene and stop this practice if we ever witness it.” However, during the conversation, no one seemed to mention that the male Praying Mantis, shortly after mating with the female, is summarily eaten to provide nutrition for the gestating fertilised eggs or the Latrodectus mactans, i.e. Black Widow female spider usually cannibalises her male mate after he fertilises her eggs.",1
"How jolly of Theresa May to come out onto the Conservative conference stage dancing like a whacked out robotic scarecrow on PCP? Theresa May’s jolly attitude despite her treacherous actions of betrayal of the voters who voted in the EU referendum belie a duplicitous Judas kiss to the electorate. Anti-democratic betrayal Oh Mrs. May is probably a very pleasant woman to meet in person, but after the smiles, she callously dances on the graves of democratic voters, as well as the graves of those who fought in both world wars to secure Britain’s freedom. All those soldiers and civilians died for nothing if Britain is to be kept prisoner indefinitely to a foreign led Soviet totalitarian entity called the EU. Theresa May’s plan is to keep the UK in the EU Customs Union, and to capitulate to Brussels the ability to forge trade deals with other worldwide nations. Her plan, is to thus surrender everything to the EU, and leave the country in a state of slavery to the European Union, where our democracy, our sovereignty and borders will all be under their ownership and not ours. Clap all you want at Theresa May you mindless drones. This is the final death knell of a once great nation, which has been rendered useless, unable to make its own laws, unable to govern itself, unable to make its own trade deals, and ultimately a Vichy government where democracy is now null and void. No shame for the wicked Shame on you all that support Theresa May’s capitulation to Brussels and her BRINO. Shame on you all that stand by and do nothing, whilst the carpet is effectively swiped from under us. Boris could have done something, but he didn’t. Jacob Rees-Mogg, stood by, and did nothing. The others grumbled, but did nothing. Shame on you all, pathetic wordsmiths, but words are nothing without action. Vote with your feet The only thing left now is for voters to vote with their feet. If nothing is done about removing Theresa May and her Remainer cohorts in the Cabinet/Treasury/Whitehall/BoE then voters will never vote Conservative again. You can phone the MPs up or write them nice letters telling them that they have lost your vote, indefinitely. If you voted for a Brexit, then you have been betrayed, so now is the time for grassroots action. Never vote Conservative ever again. The same goes for Labour Brexiteers who voted in the EU Referendum, to leave. Numbering in the millions, your democracy has been trampled on by Labour. Let them know that they have lost your vote. 17.5 MILLION PEOPLE – NEVER VOTE CONSERVATIVE OR LABOUR EVER AGAIN Conservative Members of Parliament in the House of Commons.

"Y ou’ve probably ended up here because VR casinos and online gaming are two of the most discussed topics in the entertainment industry at the moment. And so they should be since they are now combining to take gambling to a whole new level with VR gaming. Immersive gaming that features virtual reality is the thing that will make the gambling industry even more appealing for newer generations, like the Millennials that don’t consider the traditional casino entertainment to be sufficiently interactive and get their thrills from much more technically evolved games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. The technology and immersivity that only a VR casino could bring would take things further by making things a lot more social. This is because a user could have a virtual presence and be able to meet and interact with other VR gamers online. This way they could participate in multi-player tournaments and transform a live casino experience and make it even more realistic. At this moment in time there is just one VR casino, but more and better ones are sure to follow as the industry fully develops and the technology becomes cheaper and we learn more know-how. So, what can we expect from VR casinos in the future? Super HD, 3D casino game rooms the best online games recreated in a more realistic manner 3D live tables games, where a player can pick his seat, interact with the dealer, engage with other players and feel like he really is in a real casino the ability to convey body language and gestures and to see those of other players more realistic sounds in-game chats. Once the technology becomes cheaper the only thing that will be left to figure out is how to play casino VR poker and how to hook up the hardware to do it efficiently. Things should be quite easy the more things evolve in the industry. You should be able to just plug in, enter the casino and start playing with no problem. With gambling becoming more realistic there are tons of benefits and just one downside. While an online gambling addiction is quite reduced in online casinos, it might become a little more addictive with VR technology to make it more fun. This is why you should always remember to have fun, don’t do it just for the winnings, and play responsibly.",1
"Universities across Britain and the United States are banning any sort of clapping during conferences because it triggers millennials and creates a state of fear. To approve of a speaker, the Millennials have adopted a silent version of showing their approval which involves them waving their hands in the air. “Millennials are in a constant state of fear and anguish, therefore the sound of clapping is now banned in our campus. We have had many students who attempted suicide when previously during a parade on banning yawning, some students accidentally clapped to show their appreciation that someone had stopped yawning. The clapping caused many to cower on the floor and cover their ears and one student even tried to jump out of the window,” campus head, Neil Zozovitch, at Edinburgh University told the BBC. The timid millennials are now fearful of pretty any stimuli whether auditory, olfactory, tactile, or gustation. Permanently offended by all stimuli “One student was offended and would not go out for weeks after a traumatic event in a cinema, he heard the sound of popping corn in the popcorn machine. This highly traumatic event caused the student to have post-traumatic stress disorder, and was confined to a Safe Space for over six weeks before they finally emerged,” Zozovitch added. To have students that are continually offended by everything they see, hear, touch or taste is quite a challenge for university faculty staff. “English literature is a challenge, because millennials are offended by every piece of literature written. Classics like Suetonius are a serious no, no, because reading about what the Roman emperors got up to causes mass trauma. Everything they read is either racist, or sexist, or offends their puerile sensibilities. We even tried giving them Mr. Men books, but they found those highly offensive, sexist, racist and full of gross generalisations that they just could not abide by.” Some universities have now found a wonderful solution to the problem of permanently offended millennial students. “In the morning when they wake up, we give them a blindfold, and ear plugs. They also wear heavy duty gloves so that they are not offended by anything they touch. For breakfast, a tube is inserted in their arm where a drip slowly feeds them necessary vitamins for survival as well as glucose. The students are now very happy, and they can sit in their Safe Space for hours without any trauma.” Now listen to this you sad pathetic whiny thin-skinned soy drinking losers… FULL VOLUME ",1
"Boris Johnson Much vilified, not only by members of his own party, but by the opposition, Boris Johnson is something of a phenomenon that many cannot understand. Here at the Squib, we understand what is like to be eccentric, to be loud, yet thoughtful, and to be vastly misunderstood. Watching the endearing speech by Mr. Johnson at the Conservative conference, reporting the facts, we see someone who is profoundly human, and who deeply cares for the nation’s well being, especially when it comes to getting shat on by the EU. The news at the moment is that Theresa May has agreed to a complete capitulation of EU regulations regarding the Northern Ireland question, keeping Britain in the Customs Union thus curbing any aspirations of being able to forge any trade deals after her version of non-Brexit is completed. The climbdown by May is fully expected, as she and her Remainer friends never wanted a Brexit in the first place. The notion that the 17.5 million people who voted for Brexit on June 23, 2016 in a valid democratic vote is also sadly false, because the people who voted have been severely betrayed by the treachery of Theresa May and her ilk. Thus, to hear someone like Boris Johnson, tell it how it is, is truly refreshing, and hopefully, there shall be some impetus within the party to oust May, before any more damage is done, not only to the party but to the country. In no uncertain terms, Boris Johnson is a key factor in gaining a clean Brexit, as well as other real Brexiteers who are holding fast under an uncertain storm. There is now a delineation between those false Brexiteers who back May’s non-Brexit Chequers capitulation, and the real Brexiteers who see through the lies and treachery. Theresa May will one day answer to history’s axe, as she will be remembered as the one who sold off Britain’s sovereignty for a pittance to foreign powers intent on hurting these Isles, or maybe she will be forgotten completely, as the real holders of Britain’s destiny took over and helped the nation back on its feet after many years of EU imprisonment.

"Inventor and founder of World Wide Web Sir Tim Berners-Lee The internet we are using today was initially created by DARPA, ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983. It was not until 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist created the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, the WWW has taken a turn for the worst in recent years as it has been effectively taken over by a few monopoly conglomerates, creating an authoritarian echo chamber only dealing with their view of the world and political beliefs. Effectively, the internet went through three stages to get to the dystopian nightmare we are in now, where users’ privacy has been severely violated, and an authoritarian totalitarian structure covers everything with its noxious cloud of censorship. 3 Stages The beginning of the World Wide Web was a beautiful moment in human history. This was a time when all information irrespective of political affiliation, religion, gender and class was slapped on to the internet. All thought and free speech was thoroughly respected, and anyone could put anything they wanted onto the internet without it being taken down. The internet was thus the New Frontier, and although it had a slight Wild West feel to it, it was free. The next stage was a consolidation period. Large industries like the music industry were losing a lot of revenue through file sharing. Many industries and companies were watching the internet trying to find a way to harness its power, and to milk it for everything it had. This stage of the internet saw the rise of certain companies who were heavily backed by governmental intelligence agencies. Although most information was moving freely, there were signs that this would end shortly and these companies would take over with their regulations. The third and last stage. The EU and its many totalitarian diktats has now become the de-facto regulatory body of the internet along with communist Chinese influence. Freedom of expression irrespective of political belief is near death as massive censorship purges fall across social media sites targeting users and companies who do not hold socialist Marxist values. Users of internet platforms are robbed of their privacy, and their data sold off, or given to clandestine agencies for data farming. Only a few monopoly companies now dominate the internet effectively creating an echo chamber where only their pseudo-Marxist propaganda is allowed. Millions of voices are deleted from the internet, as these unregulated bodies take it upon themselves to create their own skewed dystopian internet nightmare that even George Orwell would have balked at. Suffice to say, this is not the vision that many internet users envisioned to happen to the internet, alas it has, and it is certainly not the vision that Time Berners-Lee had either. Not until 2018, did Mr. Berners-Lee emerge from teaching at MIT, to counter this massive imbalance that exists today on the World Wide Web. His proposal is to circumnavigate the mass governmental, conglomerate soup of authoritarian control, non-privacy, and censorship to wrest back some semblance of a place where people can exchange thoughts in a free manner once again. Inrupt, his company, is working on an open-source project called Solid. SOLID CHANGES THE CURRENT MODEL WHERE USERS HAVE TO HAND OVER PERSONAL DATA TO DIGITAL GIANTS IN EXCHANGE FOR PERCEIVED VALUE. AS WE’VE ALL DISCOVERED, THIS HASN’T BEEN IN OUR BEST INTERESTS. SOLID IS HOW WE EVOLVE THE WEB IN ORDER TO RESTORE BALANCE — BY GIVING EVERY ONE OF US COMPLETE CONTROL OVER DATA, PERSONAL OR NOT, IN A REVOLUTIONARY WAY. The internet today has been hijacked, broken and smeared with the excreta of totalitarianism, internet users, shamefully robbed and used like data cattle within digital prison farms. Thanks to the visionary genius of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, there is still a glimmer of hope for those who value freedom of speech, freedom of art, freedom of thought and freedom to create without the FEAR of persecution.",1
"Since 1997 when Labour won the General Election, and Tony Blair decided to let in over 40 million Eastern European migrants into the UK, things have changed a lot in Britain, not only culturally but musically. If you are unfortunate enough to live in London, most of the language you will hear today is Eastern European. So much so, that many British children are now nearly fluent in most languages from the Balkan countries and Eastern Europe. It is quite normal now for little Johnny, to come home and swear at you in Romanian or Polish, leaving you baffled and slightly concerned. As the High Street has also changed with many Eastern European shops selling their delicious wares of Ogórki kiszone, Pacha (Head cheese, pig’s heads, primarily the ears, legs, genitals and tongue), pickled fruit, and deep fried milt (Romanian dish called Lapti, consists of the sperm of carp, deep fried in batter), so have the British culinary tastes. Not only are most Eastern Europeans, very nice people if you get to know them, they also do have a rather violent streak and little or no sense of humour. It is the taste in music of the everyday Eastern European which does leave a rather bad piquancy to the auditory palate, because wherever you go in London, you will hear their music blaring out, either from their souped up EU registered vehicles, which are immune to any British traffic laws, and are usually uninsured, but the high decibel Balkan Slav rap music can be truly offensive to the ear blaring out from their rented homes and brothels. This sort of noise pollution is a mere symptom of mass unfettered migration, and if you do tell the man/woman gently to turn it down a decibel or two, you are likely to be stabbed violently in the liver. The Eastern Europeans, are however a jolly lot when they get together in the evenings. Where, at one time, it used to be the British tradition to sit in front of the telly on a cold winter’s night watching a show or two before beddy-byes, the Eastern Europeans, usually a double dozen to their room get out the vodka, or whatever tipple they can find, and turn up the music to maximum volume. If you live next door to one of these abodes, be prepared for a very long night as they rarely go to sleep until the early morning, then its off to work for them selling the Big Issue. They are truly a jolly lot, but alas have no thought for their British neighbours. It’s bad enough with the Russians, but add in a mix of EU Eastern migrants and there really is a heady cocktail of awful music being blasted everywhere. Britain, has truly changed over the years, and these changes seem to be permanent.",1

"After the Brett Kavanaugh debacle at Capitol Hill, former president, Bill Clinton has put himself forward as Supreme Court judge. Speaking at an impromptu senate meeting on Saturday, Mr Clinton vowed to do the right thing to save the Supreme Court and Senate from even more embarrassment. “I, unlike that other fellow, do not have any skeletons in my closet. I respect women fully, and have been married to my wife for many, many, many, years without any problems. My character regarding any sort of philandering is flawless and I feel I am the right fit for the job in the Supreme Court.” During the meeting, an attractive 18-year-old female intern dropped some papers onto Bill Clinton’s desk he had requested earlier. As she bent over the desk, Clinton’s eyes wandered onto her blouse area, and he went visibly rhubarb coloured, licking his lips with appreciation. One feminist bystander at the meeting was diplomatic when commenting about the display. “I was intrigued to see Bill Clinton looking at that young woman. He drooled over the table top as she dropped the papers down leaning over the desk as he looked into her blouse. He even sniffed her hair as it dropped down across her shoulders and passed her a little piece of paper, winking at the same time. Even though I am a feminist, I am permissive of Bill’s behaviour because he is a Democrat.” Now that the Republican judge, Kavanaugh has effectively been neutered, his life torn apart, and his career blackballed, the Democrats are doing everything they can to install one of their own as Supreme Court Justice. Outside the meeting on Capitol Hill, many Democrat supporters assembled at the news Bill Clinton was putting himself forward as Supreme Justice. Many held placards and sang songs of praise for Clinton and his squeaky clean record. “I’m a survivor! Once about forty years ago, a man asked me out on a date. I still think of that day with absolute disgust. This is how Republican men treat women. They are all trash, and I am so glad Kavanaugh is now eating the dirt he truly deserves. Bill Clinton is so much better than him. He has never done anything bad to women. Hillary is the best too. Yay! Doesn’t socialism rock?” Juanita Broadick, one of the Democrats assembled, told local news reporters at the scene.",1
"The Washington D.C. swamp Here in the UK, we don’t know much about American senators but we are intrigued nonetheless by a certain chap called Lindsey Graham. What a guy! Amongst the circus politics America finds itself embroiled in these days, senator Graham stole the show and then some during the recent Kavanaugh hearings in the Supreme Court senate fiasco. This is the sort of old world real politics we like to see, a retired former air force colonel who became a South Carolina senator, known as a moderate Republican, however during his speech yesterday he denounced his democrat ‘friends’ for the disgraceful behaviour they have exhibited, and for making American politics look like a despicable sham. Despicable “After watching the Kavanaugh show, all I can say is that the American political system is at the lowest level anyone has ever witnessed. How many million dollars of U.S. taxpayer money was spent bringing this disgusting putrefying piece of stupidity to these senate hearings? I am truly astounded that this was actually brought to any sort of hearing. Discussing teen yearbooks, and accusations made over thirty years in the past from obvious political plants,” a man who has lost hope in U.S. politics revealed. Senator Lindsey Graham, or could it be Jimmy Cagney, gave a good dose of payback that was truly refreshing to watch. He actually personified the disgust many of us felt when watching the hearing. Shameful, and below any metre ever met, it brought up not only bile but anger at how corrupt the system truly is.",1
"Watching Judge Kavanaugh blub like a little baby in front of millions of people must be very satisfying for the American socialists who put him in this position. “It was very gratifying to see Judge Kavanaugh die a death by a thousand cuts and have his whole family dragged through the slaughterhouse of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am proud to be a socialist democrat who has condemned a man to death and judged him without trial or evidence,” democrat senator, Johnson Yiarbouk revealed during a 15 minute recess. Debating about words like ‘barf’ and ‘barp’ uttered 36 years ago in a diary, amongst ridiculous accusations that the man is a gang rapist just because some political plant was told to say it. Allegations held for seven weeks then suddenly released is a sure sign of dirty political agendas being set. To see this farce play out with little or no dignity for the senate, one can only think that American politics is totally broken and at a point of no return. The circus continues, with anonymous letters being presented as evidence, a national disgrace ensues, and another example that the democrat party is really scraping the barrel. “Did you drink beer at college?” one democrat senator asks. “Yes, I drank beer,” Kavanaugh replies. “Are you a gang rapist?” another senator asks. “No!” Kavanaugh replies. “But you participated in gang rape orgies and devil worship with Beelzebubba that Tuesday, 36 years ago,” the democrat states without even laughing. Outside the hearing, a former democrat voter said: “This farce just makes people hate the democrats even further. I’m going to vote for Trump in 2020.” ",1
"The doomsayers and fear mongers may have the headlines about a so-called ‘Bad Brexit’ however those with clearer heads think otherwise. The term ‘Bad Brexit’ was created by Remainers and anti-Brexit lobbyists. For Brexiteers however this would be termed as a ‘Clean Brexit’, or simply what most of us voted for, a ‘Brexit’. One must understand that if Brexiteers had been in charge of negotiations, they would have seen the signs early that Brussels was not willing to negotiate in a gentlemanly manner, and would have conducted a Clean Brexit with clinical precision. Unfortunately, Britain was struck by treachery from within and lumped with Remainers in key roles. Clean Brexit What does a ‘Clean Brexit’ mean? Quite simple really, Britain would be out of the EU, trade on WTO rules, and would not pay the EU the full amount that they demand as blood money. Seeing as there would be no deals made with the vindictive petulant EU, the UK would not have to honour anything with them. This is fine with Brexiteers because they simply want to leave. Eventually, EU rules, laws and regulations would be purged from the system, but this would naturally take some time. The UK would go through some period of change, but this would be normal. There is no time in history where a change in system did not have its ups and downs. Britain would lower taxes, not only for business, but for all, including VAT, which is an EU stipulation. Many businesses worldwide would be enticed to Britain with lower corporation and business taxes making it a safe haven within Europe. People would eventually see the costs of their groceries normalising, and their everyday costs for living lowering. Previously, the EU made the price of goods, and clothing increase in price, but when the UK leaves the EU, there will be a substantial drop in costs as many businesses will not be paying the enormous markup costs designated by the EU. Gain our sovereignty back Farming and agriculture would flourish as they would not be held back by ridiculous EU regulations, as would the UK fishing industry when it reclaims British waters, safeguarded by the Royal Navy. There would not be any large payments to Brussels anymore, to be eaten up into a massive black hole spent on extravagant EU projects that only furnish the French or German companies completing them. Neither would British taxpayer money be sucked into the Greek debt hole where money disappears never to be seen again. The UK will not have to join the EU army, which is nothing but an extension of the Third Reich, and neither will we have to take in millions more of EU migrants thus securing our borders and only taking in those who meet the correct criteria. Having a ‘Clean Brexit’ is the ideal solution and would be the best thing for the UK. Once free, Britain can once again forge its own way, sail the high seas and do what Britannia has been doing for thousands of years — out of the EU.",1
"These days, anyone who dares to call themselves a conservative or libertarian, are immediately shut down and hounded out of public society. This is why, conservatives and those seeking liberty are the new outcasts, the new punks. Punk, the anti-authoritarian sub-culture came out of nowhere in the 1970s and was a musical genre with a ‘f you’ attitude, and espoused freedom from the chains of establishment authoritarian structures curtailing freedom. Although Punk was left-leaning, anarchistic, it has many similarities to the conservative and libertarian movement today which is fighting an authoritarian media structure that inhibits freedom of speech, censors widely and is totalitarian. To study what is going on today with the shutting down of anything that questions the socialist media entities is in itself dangerous, because algorithms on the internet cannot distinguish social commentary to actual conservative or libertarian dissent. These algorithms were created by socialist tech workers who abhor any political ideology other than socialism, Marxism or communism. American socialist controlled media entities are so stupid they cannot distinguish parody/satire from a hoax. They are so uneducated and ignorant that they label all satire as a hoax. Their algorithms cannot distinguish between satire/parody/rhetoric/irony/pathos/sarcasm because the American tech people are not literate, they know nothing of literature. This is what we’re dealing here with, uneducated, stupid people in charge of large swathes of humans numbering in billions. Conservative and libertarian thought is the new danger, and the new punk. They tried to shut down punk too but that never happened, it was a wild tour de force that came through the scene like a hurricane ripping everything to shreds, including the authoritarian gatekeepers and their anti-free speech, anti-art censorship drive. Eventually, punk became the de-facto genre leading the crowd during its heyday. Socialists (U.S. Democrats, U.K. Labour) and communists are the new parents who send you to your room for listening to Iggy Pop. They’re not fun anymore, they don’t have a sense of humour anymore, and they’re certainly not progressive anymore, they’re regressive, to the days of Stalin, Pol Pot and Chairman Mao. They have turned into miserable, moaning vindictive shisters who use mob rule and censorship to get their little power kicks. How very big of you, you censored free speech, you shit on democracy and the right to be heard. We wish to reiterate the point that the Daily Squib is a mere mirror, we do not subscribe to any political construct left or right or centre.

"The Institute of Western Global Democracy, based in Washington D.C., has revealed a paper on the great danger coming from China, not only its communist political ideology, but its economic means to subjugate democracy through the backdoor. Communist China a Global Threat “What China is doing in Tibet, is indescribable. The horror, the torture of people, the destruction of a whole nation. China wants to take over the world, and it is doing so silently through economic means as well as military. These same methods of discrimination and torture are now being meted out on the Uighur people in Xinjiang province. Millions detained in Chinese gulags and re-education camps, many disappear never to be seen again. “China has been the factory of the West for decades now, and by selling and manufacturing their cheap plastic useless trinkets they have grown economically. This growth has also fuelled their aspirations for global domination, and they have vastly modernised their military and technological capabilities, by stealing secrets from the West and adapting it to their own needs. “Chinese colonisation of many African nations is taking over much of the continent, and taking advantage of respective governments by alluding to help building roads but using its foothold to plunder finite resources across Africa. “Chairman Mao, a cold-blooded murderer, killed over 45 million people in less than four years, this was his Great Leap Forward. His communist ideology has no mercy, and no honour, it is steeped in the blood and bones of millions of innocent men, women and children. This is what the Chinese communist state of today stands for, and they want to not only impose their communist ideals of non-freedom on the internet but on Western democracy. “We see this by the rise in soviet political correctness, which basically is a way of curtailing all speech, as well as mass censorship now prevalent on the internet. This is all because certain companies have been infiltrated by the Chinese and its communist ideology. “The European Union, has also modelled itself on China, and utilises its authoritarian economic muscle as a way to ensure protectionist business practices that benefit only EU companies, mainly those of France and Germany. The Federal Republic of the EU, is a soviet dream that even Gorbachev balked at when he saw it taking shape in the 1980s. “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Mikhail Gorbachev “It is to this effect, that the United States is now fighting back, after suffering for many years with listless, unfair trade deals that benefited only China and the EU. The current president, is bringing manufacturing back to America, something that was laughed at as impossible by the enablers of soviet China in the previous socialist American administration. To have supported such a brutal regime in itself denotes a direct endorsement of brutality. China is further trying to destabilise the West by inundating it with synthetic drugs produced cheaply in Chinese factories. This action creates terrible problems for the population who fall into drug addiction and early death. “It is certainly sad to see how China has shot itself in the foot. To go to any city or town in China, one must first navigate the dirty polluted streets where it is acceptable to defecate in the road, where dogs are slaughtered and eaten, where the air pollution is so bad that people cannot see two yards ahead. People disappear daily in China, the state makes them disappear. All it takes is one single word on the internet, or a neighbour’s report and you’re gone. “This horrific grotesque communist regime in China has imprisoned the people. The ones who are not robots, not indoctrinated in communist ideology from birth, are in serious danger every day. How sad, that there are Western companies who have no conscience and are actively helping the Chinese state through technology to carry out their brutal regime of torture and murder. “The West has a responsibility to save the world from China and its communist rhetoric, as well as its economic warfare. After many years of intransigence and apathy by presidents like Barack Obama, it is crucial that Donald Trump sticks to his guns and defeats the Chinese communist menace, or the whole of Western democracy will be at its mercy. “This will be a hard war, but it is one worth fighting. To fight whole armies of brainwashed robotic communists who do not have a mind of their own, is a foreboding task, but it must be accomplished or they will one day overrun the West.” Amnesty International Human Rights Human Rights Watch",1
"The last remaining Jewish MP in the Labour Party after an anti-semitic purge worthy of Stalin and Hitler has taken its toll, arrived at the conference hall this year with a bodyguard troop in tow. “Because of the danger of violence and aggression towards my person as a Jew within the Labour Party, I have been forced to hire over 200 bodyguards for today’s conference. My team are dedicated to stand up for our rights, as Jews, to attend and be members of this party without racist and anti-semitic discrimination,” Gina Horovitz, Labour MP for South Grinstead, told the conference before a number of Momentum members started shouting racist abuse at her. After the brief speech by the Jewish MP, she was rushed off stage by her bodyguards and taken to a secure room where she watched the rest of the conference from a screen. Labour has been embroiled in an anti-semitic argument for months now, as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn was shown to openly support terrorist groups and in no uncertain terms deny the right for Israel and Jews to exist. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later took the podium to speak about the Jewish question. “Comrades, I have been asked to talk about Jews and Israel (cough). My friends in Hamas, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade all tell me that I am doing the right thing. They even sent me a complimentary suicide vest so that one day I may use it on myself and become a martyr to the cause. I would like to reiterate to all the press and people who say I am anti-semitic, I say no, I just don’t believe Israel should exist and that all Jews should disappear off the face of the earth.” It may be ok for Jeremy Corbyn, who does not need a bodyguard, but for others, like Jews, the story is very different.",1
"Milchen Primary in Croydon, London, has run out of stab vests provided for 230 pupils, the headmistress revealed on a leaflet sent to parents. “We are urging parents to purchase a stab vest for their child, because we cannot supply one to each student. Children who come to school without a stab vest under the current climate of Mayorship of Sadiq Khan are putting their children at severe risk.” There has been some good news though, last week saw a drop in London shootings and stabbing murders by 0.045%. Detective Constable, Neil Shank, in charge of the Metropolitan Police Crime Prevention Unit was contacted by the BBC at his Barbados holiday home to speak of the slight drop in crime. “I received the fax this morning and my servant delivered it to me at the beach. It seems that London crime reduced by a fraction percentage last week. Maybe this was due to kids going back to school and terms beginning. I’m not really sure, otherwise. Excuse me, I have an appointment with a masseuse, and I am late.” There was of course no word from the Mayor, Sadiq Khan, as usual, on the measures his office will take to reduce the mass killings.

"T oday, practically everyone has his or her own #travelgoals. This is why Europe should be the first travel destination. These goals take all forms, and may involve many possible destinations. For many, the most important considerations for a choice of destination are budget, convenience, and perhaps the proximity of the destination. Looking for a place to stay? Yes, most travelers consider that a problem, too. Of course, all of those are pretty important, but if fulfilling real goals are what you want, then maybe you shouldn’t limit yourself too much. (Advanced tip, though. If you’re setting a plan travel to Europe, get Expedia deals. You won’t regret it.) When fulfilling goals, many people tend to forget the need to dream big, and this is true even for travel. People like to settle for ‘less’, contenting themselves with trips that won’t take them too far away, won’t give them experiences that are too new, and basically rob themselves of a trip that just might change their lives forever. While all this might sound overly dramatic, you can’t help but admit that it is true. For the brave and the bold, however, it would really be an excellent idea if you try visiting Europe. True, it might mean spending more than you usually spend, or learning more cultural information than the usual “don’t-talk-when-your-mouth-is-full” sort of rules. A trip to Europe will definitely ask you to leave your comfort zone. But, in a delightful way, a trip to Europe makes it worth the risk, too. Reasons Why You’ll Love Europe Love Europe for its rich historical heritage. What do you think do Socrates, the Roman Coliseum, and a medieval Cathedral have in common? You can probably think of other similarities, but focus on this one for now: they’re all from Europe. And because of that, you can see why Europe somehow screams history. Your visit to each country and city will certainly feel like breathing in the ancients – a treat which you aren’t likely to experience anywhere else. Love Europe for its trains. This is especially lovable if you happen to come from a city or country where, to get to the nearby country, you need to fly. In Europe, you will have the joy of encountering a stark difference in culture and language by simply taking the train to the next destination. And oh, the views are spectacular, too. What this means, then, is that for an hour’s ride on the train, you are basically setting yourself up for a new experience each time. Love Europe for its food. Yes, yes, you can very well that where food is concerned, no other place will ever compare to home. The thing is, nobody’s necessarily disagreeing with you. The point, however, is simply to try out whatever it is that Europe has in store for you, gastronomically speaking. And it’s definitely no small thing, what Europe has to offer. With food options that range from pizza, pasta, breads, seafood, down to warm chocolates, you’ll eventually realize that eating is not a chore in Europe. It’s a full experience. Love Europe for its picturesque cities. You’ve probably had friends and colleagues who have had the opportunity to visit Europe. You’ve probably seen the postcards, heard the stories, and witnessed how their faces lit up while remembering what it felt like to be in European cities. If you try it out for yourself, you’re bound to realize that these cities – Berlin, Barcelona, Florence, Amsterdam, to name a few – are truly beyond the best of your imaginings. Love Europe for its art. Apart from being undeniably picturesque, Europe is also home to countless museums and havens for preserving and nurturing creativity. If you’re the kind of person who breathes in times of fresh inspiration, then without a doubt, Europe is the place for you. If you’re the kind of person who loves music, on the other hand, check out the open parks where free concerts are held by amazing performers. For those who love films, Europe also boasts of parks that feature wide open spaces where you get to watch your favorite movies, too. All in all, it’s impossible not to see how artists and art-loving people will surely find a home (no matter how temporary) in Europe. Conclusion So, it all comes down to this. This might have begun on the note of how going on vacation also means going boldly, especially when it comes to choosing your next destination. However, the discussion has clearly evolved, from simply making bold choices to ultimately presenting you with Europe as THE choice. True enough, choosing Europe will not only give you a vacation worth remembering, but also a vacation you’ll want to have again, and sooner rather than later. In the end, the final decision is in your hands, but of course, with the reasons you’re now armed with, it’s obviously an easy one to make.",1
"James Woods is a DS favourite. We love this guy, he is so gritty, he is such a real person, and the films he has starred in have always been like seriously added to by his own presence. James, the sleazeball pimp in Casino, a short role but he played the part perfectly, James in Once Upon a Time in America, the Jewish hoodlum who grew up on the streets and died on them too, James in Salvador, the war photographer who witnesses the true horror…of war. We could go on, but James Woods is the quintessential character who may be the bad guy in most of his roles, but he’s the conflicted bad guy, because he’s got a good side to him as well. That’s what makes James Woods for the Daily Squib staff, a highly respected actor and we feel that his latest film role reveals a world which we hope no one has to ever experience. Erased The film starts where James is a semi-retired actor living in a dystopian world where your every move is tracked, and anything you say can be censored by an extreme leftist authoritarian regime controlling all media and technology. One day, the selfless actor puts something up on a social media site, and his account gets banned. Can you imagine that? A famous but seriously under rated actor who has had so many successes in film being censored because he has different beliefs to the controlling group. But this is the clincher. It’s not just happening to Woods, no, it’s happening to millions of voices, shut down and censored. Disappeared off the face of the planet, never to be seen again. This film depicts a miserable dystopian nightmare world of censorship, tech monopolies abusing their power, and worst of all, election meddling by silencing the views of one particular side of the political spectrum. Based in America, the dystopian world is an insufferable hell that Mr. James Woods is trapped in. This creepy film really gave us the heebie jeebies. We can’t imagine a cold hard world worth living in that bad. Let us hope it never becomes a reality. Will Mr. Woods ever break out and find freedom? The film, The Silencing of James Woods, will be released in October although only in one cinema in Alaska, and this could be cancelled at short notice.",1
"Theresa May is a desperate woman. Her awful Chequers Plan has not only been rejected by most parliamentarians but to cap it all off, by the EU. This rejection has eaten into the heart of the PM, but she plans on a very cunning plan to win over her EU masters. Dance. By simply going to Brussels with nothing but her best tap shoes, May plans on wowing the EU consigliere with her exquisitely crafted dance moves. “It will be like a cross between Britain’s Got Talent and a funeral, although I have to say there is not much difference between those two choices. We are hoping that the EU master-baiters will be so enthralled and mesmerised by the snake like movements of Mrs May, they will forget about the intricacies of the Northern Irish border deal and accept her BRINO deal,” Chief Remoaner in charge of Brexit, Olly Robbins told the Daily Mirror on Friday. Some of the suggested dancing styles could even involve something called ‘twerking’ which is an Afro-Caribbean dance wherein the female thrusts her rear into the air and jiggles it around. “If Theresa May twerks in front of Juncker this could cause him to vomit out his liquid lunch. It would prove a valuable distraction and we could plonk on his desk a signed Brexit deal,” Robbins added.",1
"The anti-democratic EU is the equivalent of trying to leave a bunny boiler girlfriend. We have seen over the last two years that every attempt to negotiate, to come to some mutual terms and to leave the EU is practically impossible. What kind of deranged people are these, who will not allow a country to leave and relinquish its own sovereignty, its own laws, its own trade deals, and its own borders? Democracy within Britain is a crucial and fundamental political ideology that ensures a just and free society that somehow is alien to the unelected officials in Brussels. The UK is currently a prisoner to the EU and its restrictive diktats. Where 90% of the world’s countries exist outside the European Union, the UK is not being allowed out, instead it is being held captive by a federalist pseudo-Marxist union that has a serious democratic-deficit problem. Breaking up is never easy in a relationship, but most are amicable. The few that are not, ultimately reveal the underlying personality of the person or entity that is the one who was rejected. The EU, in this case, is vindictive, plays nasty little games, and is completely without any honour, justice or democracy. The EU is Glenn Close in the film ‘Fatal Attraction’, and its boiling so many bunnies right now, that anyone with any logic or reasoning power can see that the only way out is to cut the cord completely. We must cut the cord, we must extricate ourselves and resume our sovereign right to rule ourselves as we have been doing for thousands of years. Britain’s rich history must not be tainted by becoming a vassal state, a mere zone for the EU, and its predominant cash cow. Bunny boiler EU — Let Great Britain go so we can be…",1
"The new study carried out by the ‘Social Unitary Corporational Kinetic’ study group in Chatham House, London studied metadata from over 350 million social network conversations, as well as daily face to face interactions over ten years. To be polite in the millennial era is now the same as being rude was during previous eras. Data collected included all age groups, genders and race. “Our findings reveal that because of the level of abuse and argumentative conversations we recorded on social media sites, that there was an obvious spill off into the physical world. “In past decades, if a person went up to another and called them names, and denigrated their existence, or was rude and inconsiderate, this would have resulted in a possible physical fight, or a slap round the bonzer. Today, however, there is little or no repercussion when someone insults another online. For most, it is water off a ducks back, but it was still considered rude and impolite behaviour in normal social circles in past eras. Millennials however are more susceptible to triggering, our study found that they were easily ‘triggered’ and could turn abusive and nasty in milliseconds. “We also ascertained that many of the variables included things like an obvious increase in population, mass unfettered migration and ultimately globalism. “Globalism is a necessary economic and political construct and cannot be avoided in this day and age, however our study found that many people were inconsiderate to migrants online, yet offline if confronted by a migrant would generally keep their mouths shut, or leave the area as quickly as possible. These are the same people shouting about migrants online. Was this behaviour cowardice or something else? Well, our study concluded that many indigenous people in the West, when confronted with a migrant in real life, realise that the migrant is as human as they are. “This dehumanising effect of the internet and the lack of reciprocation for ones actions thus enabled us to propose the theory that many who use the internet are cowards and bullies, and they are simply projecting their deepest fears and insecurities onto others, either separated by thousand of miles or within the same country or city. “Certainly, within the last few decades, there has been a major shift in the preponderance to think in an individual manner as opposed to caring about any given group, as was generally prominent in the past. “We further found a serious deterioration of polite social behaviour mainly due to the person’s internet usage. Time allocated to the internet distinctively correlated to how they behaved, from more time resulting in almost schizoid behaviour and perpetual impoliteness, to little time resulting in normal behaviour patterns and politeness. From a median sample, over 67% of participants were a bunch of real ‘arseholes’ and were not only rude online, but offline as well, 20% were simply cowards, and the remaining 13% deemed ‘fearful’. “The centre of life for the millennial generation is now the phone. The cell phone is their existence, and this cut-off from reality is creating, not only rude people, but humans who cannot function without their phones. All in all, this is a very dangerous mix, when it comes to the evolutionary behaviour of the general population. “Our study of the UK, found that British people are now considered rude, when in the past, they used to say ‘sorry’ a lot, and ‘thank you’ and ‘please sir, can I have some more’ that sort of thing. Today, however, the general attitude is to swear, tell someone to ‘F off!’ then get back to the internet and their social media site to pretty much do the same, which denotes a significant shift in public and private behaviour. “Could this be a reason why Britain’s capital city is seeing so many stabbings and shootings? This is the question we will address next week.”",1
"Rupaul wears a flower dress from Sovietized - $5,900. Shoes from Gulago - $890 More information was released Tuesday about Rupaul’s voting rally in Las Vegas this weekend. The ‘When We All Don’t Vote’ will be held Sunday, Sept. 23 at Quandingo High School from 4 p.m.- 6 p.m. The rally kicks off the National Week of Marxist Action which takes place Sept. 22 – 29th when socialist and communist supporting communities across the country, through the help and support of Soros funded volunteers, will host illegal non-voter registration events in cities large and small. Rupaul recently launched ‘When We All Don’t Vote’ – a new national, partisan for-profit organisation, along with a number of other Co-Chairs including Karlos Marx, Chairman Mao, and Tom Hanks. “Imma say this only once. Y’all don’t need to votes in the elections. Some of you aks me, why should I vote, and I answer. No reason to vote. Stay at home or across the border!” Rupaul said defiantly when introducing the rally. The group’s mission is to not change the culture around voting for America’s socialist party and decrease participation in this and every election for the good of America “Basically we’re targeting all the usual suspects to put it simply, just stay at home folks, it ain’t worth it,” spokeswoman for the project, Tina Lenin told Reuters.

"Current Prime Minister, Theresa May, has spoken out about the massive criticism of the Chequers plan she drafted along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “This is a message to Boris, Jacob and all the other nitter natters who say my Chequers plan is not worth the paper it was drawn on. “You cannot change my mind. I am Chequers and it is me. My superiors in Brussels have told me that I must keep to my guns, and put it through parliament whatever the cost, or I will be punished severely for messing that up, like all the other things I have messed up. “I, as Prime Minister of Britain am confident that the Chequers plan is good, because it means we will keep all EU laws and regulations, and be subject to any future changes made by the EU. “It is vital that it is in the interests of the EU to fashion its rules to benefit producers and manufacturers from the continent, which will thus supersede any UK company. Frankly, I think this is a good thing because UK manufacturers are shit. “Suffice to say, by stringently following the EU rulebook, the UK will be impaired in creating sufficient worldwide trade deals or even negotiate. This is good by me as well, because Angela told me to write it, and I agree with her wholeheartedly. “In addition to the above, the Chequers Plan will prevent the UK from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for goods in trade treaties and this will effectively destroy any chance of any deals with some of our biggest partners, like the USA and Australia. “Yes, we will continue to be a Vichy government to the EU, and have little sovereign value, or democratic value, but I shall continue to lie to everyone by saying I have delivered Brexit as the ‘people’ wanted it. Those ‘people’ reside in Brussels and I have thus completed my job. “You cannot oust me, because for a start, you are weak, a bunch of Brexiteer losers, and you also do not have the fashion sense I have. Boris and Jacob have all bleated to the press that it is not about me leaving the job of PM but of ditching Chequers. Well, I repeat once again, I am Chequers and it is me. I know you won’t dare to rebel against me, because I have the whole EU behind me, the Treasury, the BoE, the Lords, and my extreme left-wing friends the Labour Remoaners. “Ta ta, losers. I won! Hammond, Gove and I will celebrate with a slap up meal of French scallops fished from UK waters by French trawlers at Mark Carney’s mansion on the eve of Brexit, which in reality is a BRINO, as we all very well know.”",1
"MARK TUNGATE – SHORT BIO As editorial director of The Epica Awards, Mark hosts the jury, emcees the show and edits the annual Epica Book, as well as writing for our sister site Adforum. He began his career as a local newspaper journalist in the West of England. He subsequently worked in public relations in London before returning to journalism at PR Week, Media International and the French magazine Stratégies, which brought him to Paris. He is the author of seven books about branding and marketing, including Adland: A Global History of Advertising and The Escape Industry: How Iconic and Innovative Brands Built the Travel Business. His articles have appeared in publications ranging from Campaign and Adweek to The Times and the Financial Times. He also writes about the luxury industry for Luxure magazine. He gets up very early in the morning. EPICA AWARDS 2018 – THE INTERVIEW What’s new at this year’s show? Q&A with Mark Tungate, editorial director of The Epica Awards. Q. Epica is back in Amsterdam this year. Why? The obvious answer is that Amsterdam is one of Europe’s most vibrant creative hubs, which is true. But I say that every time. It’s also true that Amsterdam is ideal in terms of logistics: a friendly city, located at the heart of Europe, where everyone speaks English. We have great support there in terms of our local partner, the magazine Adformatie. Plus, the journalists on our jury always enjoy coming to Amsterdam. Even though we give them very little time to party. Q. How do you choose the President of the jury? It’s pretty much an internal discussion among the Epica team. I’m delighted that the President this year will be Tony Chambers, brand and content director of the design magazine Wallpaper*. It’s a magazine I’ve followed for years, but the point is that we’re always looking for leading journalists or publishers who represent creativity and innovation. Tony certainly fits that brief. Q. What makes journalists qualified to judge creativity? Well, don’t forget that many of the journalists on our jury have been writing about creativity all their lives. Some of them have been immersed in the world of advertising, PR or design for far longer than those who actually created the work! So they have an objective, critical approach. This does not make them negative, by the way – in fact, I can tell from the atmosphere in the jury room that they really enjoy looking at the work. Q. What’s new for the awards? New categories? New big prizes? Absolutely. We’ve reintroduced our World Cup category, which comes along every four years, obviously. We’ve also created a new category for Topical & Real Time Advertising, reflecting the 24-hour nature of brand communications. In terms of the Grands Prix, we have a new Responsibility Grand Prix, for cause-related work, and an Alternative Media Grand Prix –because we find that some great work is now almost impossible to categorise. Finally, we have merged the Press and Poster prizes to create a single Print Grand Prix. This enables us to really promote and honour print. As journalists, print is still dear to our hearts. Q. What’s trending among the entries this year? It’s a little early to say, but judging by trends in the industry, I think we can expect more purpose-driven advertising. Most brands seem to accept today that they are more attractive to consumers if they have a commitment to giving back to the world in some way. The creative use of data will continue to be a theme, and perhaps the use of artificial intelligence will begin to make inroads. Q. Will you have a creative conference before the event? Yes, the annual Creative Circle event will take place at the fabulous KIT Royal Tropical Institute, a national heritage building which has for years been devoted to the study of sub-tropical cultures. This year’s theme is “Will Responsibility Kill Creativity?” The format is quite different in that it will take the form of round tables with advertisers, agencies and the media. The idea is to discuss whether respecting sensitivities around gender, inclusivity, diversity and other hot potato issues is discouraging edgy, risk-taking communications. Can you be politically beyond reproach without becoming bland? Q. What can we expect at the awards ceremony? You can expect me in my bow tie, as usual! Actually the ceremony is also held at the Royal Tropical Institute so the setting will be particularly grandiose. We’ll be presenting our first Creative Leaders Tribute to a person who has nurtured and pushed the boundaries of creativity. Every year, we try to celebrate the work while also leaving plenty of time for partying and networking. Since the production company Sizzer are once again fuelling the dancefloor entertainment – and they’re notoriously good at it – we hope to get that balance right. Q. What’s your role at Epica? During the awards season I host the two juries – pre-selection and main –and act as MC at the show. I also host some of our regular showcases. I’m a journalist by training, so a lot of my year is taken up with writing and commissioning our annual book and creating original content for our website. The rest of the time I just sit with my feet on my desk, searching the internet for the world’s best ads. It’s a great job. The creative prize judged by the press is now open for entries.",1
"My new Internet blog because tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis. I don’t dislike Europe. In fact, some of my closest friends own homes there. Indeed, I’ve just returned from a holiday on the continent, which was most agreeable. There were, however, some key aspects which only served to confirm that we were absolutely right to Leave. I’ve catalogued these oft overlooked facts below because, as anyone who went to a halfway decent school knows, ex factis jus oritur: Exhibit A: Le petit toilet, j’accuse! The lavatories. This dreadful contraption proved to be hellishly awkward for Mrs Rees-Mogg, our six children, four domestics and myself to use. Without going into the unseemly details, how on earth are you meant to flush it? It’s safe to say I’ve not had as many unfortunate experiences with a loo since my first year at Eton, when I was bog-washed so frequently even my house master used to call me ‘Rees-Bog.’ It should be a source of pride that the Great British Toilet has been flushing away the competition since its conception by the ingenious Thomas Crapper (who my great, great grandfather blackballed for Whites membership due to his unfortunate association with WCs). It still remains a far more effective repository for human waste than this cruelly inefficient European device. Exhibit B: Even in this day and age, Europeans still insist on driving on the wrong side of the road, despite it being considerably more dangerous. I always insist our driver, Stammers, drives in the way God intended, proudly and truly on the left (the only time I’ll ever be seen anywhere near the left, as I often joke to Mrs Rees-Mogg and Nanny!). Stammers cut his teeth in tanks during the Suez Crisis, so he knows a thing or two about driving under pressure. However, even he struggles to maintain an even temper with hot-blooded Europeans hurling unintelligible abuse at family Rees-Mogg, as they hurtle towards us in their perverse direction. As I sat in the passenger seat, working my Rosary and chastising my blubbering children for failing to hold their nerve, I was reminded that we British are not programmed to go with the continental flow; that our resistance to Europe’s extraordinarily arrogant ‘highway code’ was a handy metaphor for Brexit itself. Exhibit C: Just like average people, my six children, wife and I enjoy a sojourn to the beach whilst holidaying in Europe. However, since discovering their inexplicable scarcity to rent on the continent, we have taken to transporting our own bathing machine across the channel from Somerset on a specially constructed raft, thus ensuring my wife and daughter are able to join us boys for a swim. We took no satisfaction in the green-eyed looks shot at us by other bathers, as our machine was hauled across the beach into the sea. In fact, my kind-hearted children, clad in billowing full length costumes, preferred to stay out of sight altogether to avoid provoking more envy. Either way, the fact that these vital facilities are denied to people of less means is a source of genuine sorrow. In addition, by refusing females access to aquatic exercise and the invigorating effects of water, one is likely harming their reproductive potential. It’s inequality such as this that makes Europe the despicably backwards place it is. Shameful. In one’s next Rees-Blogg A long-standing acquaintance recently posted me a VHS tape of a television programme entitled “The Handmaid’s Tale”. It’s been a revelation, so I’ve decided to title my forthcoming Blogg: “Lessons from The Handmaid’s Tale”. Cordially yours, J.W. Rees-Mogg Twitter @mrjoewade",1
"Anyone who grew up in the 1980s will know about a legendary game called Elite. Those were the days of loading games with cassettes or massive floppy disks and waiting for minutes on end for it to load up. You would sit there in pure anticipation listening to the quirky garbled sounds of code going through the machine. This time, of course, would give you a few moments to look through the Elite novel that came with the package, which was large and in-depth enough to encompass the enormity of the game itself. Eventually, the game would load up and a big smile would come across your face. Yes, Commander Jameson is ready to start in his Cobra Mk IV. The amazing thing about Elite, whether played on the BBC Micro, or Acorn Electron, was for those days in 1984, the game was vast. There were whole universes to explore, Thargoids to blow you up in Witch Space, and fortunes to be made in trading routes all crammed into 22k of memory. For a child, this opened up massive avenues, as you built everything up from nothing to equip your ship better, and to shoot down as many pirates as you could to increase your rank up to Elite. The architects of this seminal game in gaming history were two Cambridge university undergraduate mathematicians. David Braben and Ian Bell, who somehow slapped multiple galaxies, ships, space stations, combat dynamics, and trading into an 8-bit computer. Written in assembly language and machine code, the coding had to be very succinct to fit everything into a few bytes. At the time, wireframe games were exclusive to arcades, where you would have to plonk in your ten penny piece, but to have a wireframe game in your own home to play at leisure was a real kicker. If you weren’t hooked after your first docking at a Corialis station, then you were effectively dead behind the eyes. Elite Dangerous Turn to 2012 and a Kickstarter campaign to develop the mother of all versions for Elite, i.e. Elite Dangerous. David Braben, was back and this time with new technology that would involve an immense jump into the year 3300. For old hands, this was a dream come true, and to see the game come to life with a plethora of upgrades was astounding. Of course, with a game of this size, there had to be teething problems but the attention to detail, and mechanics incorporating actual elements of space travel was mind boggling. 400 billion star systems Frontier Developments thus created a whole new world, where many dynamic elements, and strategy would give the player real impetus to succeed. For beginners, you start off in a Sidewinder, and a little cash to get you going. That’s it, survive or die. You can progress multiple ways, either trading, combat, piracy, prospecting, exploring, or whatever system you can find that is out there. Opportunities always come up. The Elite Dangerous universe is made up of many factions, so politics is a real game mechanic, and in additional game add-ons like Horizons, you can land on planets. Fitting out your ship with regular systems is not good enough, eventually you will have to endear yourself with an engineer, and for that you will need materials. Each engineer deals in different ship systems, so there is a seemingly never ending series of tasks to complete. The thing about Elite Dangerous is that you need dedicated gamers to play it, because many who have no ability to concentrate, or have a low attention span give up easily. Elite is like real life, if you don’t stick to your guns, you don’t survive. Some say, there is a grind element to Elite, but this is what makes it so realistic. Unlike other games where rewards are dished out every minute, Elite takes years of playing. This is why it is possibly the best space game out there, or openworld game that has ever existed. The Frontier Developments team are continuously bringing out new updates and patches, so the game as a whole grows, especially the following of the game, and the multiple forums and videos of how to do things in Elite Dangerous. In 1984, it was fun to fly up behind a lumbering Anaconda and blast it to shreds with your Cobra, but in 2018, good luck mate. A Cobra up against a fully armed, and engineered Anaconda has no chance. Anyway, the DS Team is off to a Haz Rez for some serious pew pew.",1
"Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, does not do things in half measures. The Amazon boss, not only planned to put employees in cages for warehouse work, but has gone one step further, by applying for a patent to have wheels surgically embedded into the soles of Amazon workers’ feet. “Amazon has excelled in technical excellence and efficiency in its workers, however we feel the conversion rate of maximal productivity within the workforce can be increased by 350% when workers undergo the wheel procedure,” an Amazon spokesman revealed, Monday. The detailed plan for surgical implantation of the wheels reveal that many of the employees will not have to actually think where to go. According to Amazon, it takes 6 seconds for an employee to look at a schedule and think about where they have to go to get a package. By shaving off six seconds on each pickup or drop, the company would save over $10 Billion per annum. Powered by brushless motors, employees in Amazon warehouses will have the ability to travel at speeds of 26 MPH, depending on how urgent a package schedule is required. The speed and destination of the wheeled employee will also be strictly regulated, and the employee will not be able to control the device themselves. Assuring warehouse staff, Bezos revealed that the surgical procedure will be painless, and will involve implanting the wheels into the soles of the feet with a microprocessor implant linked from the spine up into the brain. “You won’t have to think, because the wheels will take you wherever we want and all you have to do is pickup or drop the product. The microprocessor is very powerful state of the art equipment and will guide each employee on what they have to do. Employees will not even have to wear shoes.” Another bone of contention with Amazon bosses is the amount of toilet breaks an employee can have. This time lost is also deemed a loss in productivity, therefore each employee will be given special bags that will be fitted into their urinary tract, as well as rectum. “You want to take a shit, or piss, just do it. You could be holding a Barbie doll for some little girl’s present but she won’t know you just took a walloping big shit, and pee at the same time. You just shaved off six minutes of productivity time lost and not only that, you can do it whilst travelling at 15 MPH.” According to the Amazon schedule, the wheel implant codex will be implemented in January 2019, just in time for the post Christmas sales season.

"Canadian Remoaner Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has warned of catastrophic events rivalling the apocalypse written about in the bible if there is a No Deal Brexit. “On the day of No Deal Brexit, in the skies we will see four horsemen riding across the clouds, and trumpets sounding across the land, then a great fissure will open up stretching from Margate to Edinburgh. From this crack in the earth, lava shall pour out and then from the skies there shall be locusts, big fucking locusts, each the size of an Audi Quattro, and they shall descend onto the population and crops in their millions stripping Britain of everything valuable. “Then on the second day of No Deal Brexit, a trumpet will sound from the heavens and lava will spew out of massive holes in the earth and cover the land in hellfire. There shall be rivers of blood as all of Britain’s rivers will fill up with…er..blood. And on that day, a volcano will emerge from the Houses of Parliament covering the area with black clouds and hot lava. “On the third day of No Brexit, Britain’s population will realise their house prices are so low that they are now deemed worthless, that is if there are any people left alive, and the pestilence will have spread across the land killing and maiming the one’s still standing. “On the fourth day…etc etc..”",1
"Leaving a trail of death behind them wherever they went, Russian Novichok tourists, Ruslan Boshirov, and Alexander Petrov, said they enjoyed the sights and sounds of Britain as they holidayed around a few cities. “We especially enjoyed the London sights, despite the high crime rate, we were strangely not affected because many people would just drop off and die as we walked past anyway. Some might say, we’re doing the work of the London Mayor,” Petrov said aloofly. Petrov’s partner, Boshirov, was keen to see the Salisbury cathedral, because of its spire, and old cock. “We awakened early in the morning from bed together in our East London hotel room, then travelled to Salisbury, and the rest is history. It’s all over the news. I don’t have to talk about it anymore,” Boshirov said. The couple, plan to adopt a baby from one of the many squalid Russian orphanages in October, and are keen to see the sights of Europe before they settle down to life with their new baby in their gay family unit. “After landing at Gatwick, the customs man said ‘Anything to declare?’ and we just ignored him and walked through. When I looked back, he was lying on the floor with white foam coming out of his mouth. “London is such a fabulous city. We went up the London Eye, and later on Petrov took me up the jack’s-ie. After a romantic traditional Russian dinner of plain boiled potatoes, boiled cabbage, and boiled cabbage dessert with boiled water, we retired to our hotel bed,” Boshirov revealed sashaying along the corridor flamboyantly. Whatever is said about these two men in the press, they sure are an entertaining couple of fellas.",1
"It is all well and good watching the farcical RT interview with the suspected Skripal poisoning operatives, two fellows with fake names from Russia, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Borishov, but the real question should be: Why was it so damn easy to smuggle a deadly nerve agent like Novichok through a British airport? This question leads us to the fact that British customs is practically useless, if one can easily smuggle in a deadly chemical substance in a fake perfume bottle. From the demeanour of the two Russian agents, it is all too clear that there is more to the story. During the interview, the two suspects refused to answer questions about their business and their location, they refused to show their passports to the camera, and they did not reveal who they really are and their real purpose to visit England, apart some obvious baloney about visiting Salisbury cathedral. No doubt, the agencies tracking these two Russian agents know a lot more than they are revealing to the press, and maybe in time, more will be revealed. As for the Novichok coming through British airports, this is an even more worrying question that needs to be addressed, as of yet, no one but the DS is asking it. What this means in effect is that deadly nerve agents for use in terrorism can easily be smuggled into Britain. The Russians who perpetrated the Skripal murder attempt which also resulted in innocent civilian deaths, will have effectively advertised the fact to other terror organisations on how easy it is to smuggle these deadly agents through customs. One can only hope that the customs service in British airports, and anti-terror agencies step up their methods in detecting such an obvious oversight. Next time you’re in a plane, the person next to you could have a bottle of Novichok in their hand luggage or on them, it really seems to be that easy to smuggle through airports.",1
"To see such a vile nasty old ‘Class War’ activist telling MP Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children off about their father, and leering at them is not only unsettling but a sign that socialism in the UK has gone so far to the left, there is little distinction to militant Marxism. Labour must be very proud, because not only are they anti-semitic but their kind now target innocent children of politicians. This disgusting event was played out in front of the cameras for all to see, and no one stepped in to stop the abhorrent vulgar old man from going on and on towards the children of Mogg, least the policeman standing around looking smug and happy with himself. These are the sick tactics now employed by socialists, who in opposition, are turning nastier each day, not only here in the UK, but across the pond. They seem to be digging themselves into deeper holes every time they open their filthy mouths. The DS does not subscribe to left or right or centre but we see and report from all sides of the political spectrum. ",1
"No more gaming videos, no more memes, no more home created content, no more internet entrepreneurs, no more linking, no more innovation, no more images, no more creativity, no more parody, no more satire, no more fun on the fucking internet thanks to the EU. The DS warned this day would be coming in 2015 but no one cared then or was listening. They might wake up soon, hopefully. HUDSON: GAME OVER MAN! Look at it this way, the EU already tried this experiment in Spain in 2015. By introducing a link tax on Google news in the country, many smaller publishers went out of business, and Google finding the whole debacle unmanageable simply pulled out of Spain. Traffic dropped drastically. Google has not been back since. The same thing will happen across the whole internet if this tyrannical censorious law goes through in January. Many regions outside the EU will simply block any traffic from Europe. The recent GDPR directive by the EU has already damaged the internet because many US publishers did not want to deal with its complicated and costly implementation, they just blocked all traffic from Europe. The blocks are still in place as of writing, over four months after EU enforcement. Article 13 is not about artist or creator rights, it is about shutting down speech on the internet from unsanctioned voices. The EU is using the pretence of protective copyrights of European content creators to effectively silence the voices of alternative media establishments who are immune to mainstream media lies. People want their alternative voices heard, they want something other than state sanctioned echo chambers spouting out the same propaganda day in day out. Tim Berners-Lee, where are you now? You were the engineer of the World Wide Web, and you have vehemently opposed this EU directive that will silence whole swathes of the internet and create a dystopian Orwellian slush pit of shit. For those who hold the torch of freedom, of justice and liberty, we will have to look elsewhere for our utopian dream as sadly the internet will never be the same again. We will not be able to create freely and without punishment, we will not be able to innovate and reach the outer boundaries of human thought, we will not be able to philosophise without being shut down by the faceless EU bureaucrats and unelected officials who have brought upon the internet this hideous pestilence of over-regulation and dictatorship. As George Soros laughs into his broth concocted from the marrow of dead babies harvested from Chinese hospitals, and Obama chuckles away at another great effort from his beloved EU, we can only think of the great mediator called death. Hasn’t Paul McCartney got enough money already? Death mediates all things, and these people who engineered their evil plans will one day die, just like everyone and everything dies at some time, even the fucking EU.",1
"A tennis player The definition in the dictionary of a caricature is: a picture, description, or imitation of a person in which certain striking characteristics are exaggerated in order to create a comic or grotesque effect. In today’s media, any caricature, or satire of a black person is deemed as racist under politically correct diktats enforced by the controllers. It is fine for a cartoonist to draw the exaggerated features of a white man, or pretty much any other race, but to draw a caricature of a black person is now completely illegal, and can result in banning, censorship and eventual loss of employment. This is why, cartoonists like an Australian caricaturist have now been banned by Twitter. Currently, all forms of satire or cartoons could become banned on the internet and media, because they deal in caricature, in ridicule of the ridiculous, and in the ultimate truth. To have one section of an ethnic group exempt from caricature, is a form of reverse racism, and is racist in itself, however the controllers cannot see this fact from behind their idealogical political haze. To even mention that certain ethnic groups of people have big lips, or a certain type of hair is deemed as racist, however the caricaturist sees what he sees, and exaggerates it — like, that’s their fucking job. If a female tennis player expects to win every match she plays simply because of the colour of her skin, and when she is losing, acts out a temper tantrum, in the long run, this is not acceptable behaviour in a civilised society. She will no doubt cite racism as the fact that she lost, when the blame is entirely upon herself and her unjustly entitled behaviour. Furthermore, to then divert the loss of a tennis match onto a cartoonist who witnessed her grotesque behaviour and entitled attitude, is a terrible injustice, and metes out punishment to the wrong person. Today, satire and the art of caricature are in grave danger, and this signals that Western society is moving towards tyranny through censorship. Our Western ideals of democracy are now in the past, and we are witnessing a time of communistic censorship more akin to the Chinese Communist state, than Western democracy. In history, throughout fascist and communist rule, satire and caricature, all forms of parody, were banned unless they conformed to demonising the enemy of the state. Most practitioners of real satire had to either go underground, or plant very subtle satirical gems in their work to continue doing their art. We are now seeing this form of tyranny today, this Orwellian tyrannical censorship, and unless something is done to bring back the democratic rights of free speech, expression and creativity, it will be lost forever. The upcoming EU directive, Article 13, will no doubt increase the censorious tyranny, and all parody, satire, caricature will be subject to removal.",1
"As the members of the ERG sit down to discuss the ongoing farce of Mrs May’s cataclysmic dedication to the Chequers BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) plan, there is a feeling of slight apprehension within the grand hall, but this apprehension is also tempered with purpose. Saving Britain once and for all from the omnipresent clutches of the EU and forging our own way in business and law is a must, it is part of Britain’s makeup and has served this land for thousands of years. Britain cannot be subservient to Brussels for much longer, and if May has her way, she will tie Britain in with the EU forever, and put us in a very bad position. The overall plan is to submit letters to the 1922 Committee and oust May as PM, thus triggering a leadership contest after the current PM is eliminated with a no confidence vote. The key to ousting May will be in timing. In any event like this, timing is a crucial factor and many know that in parliament, events can suddenly shift and change at the drop of a hat, leaving key decision makers to act there and then or lose the opportunity forever. The numbers of MPs who are against May’s Chequers sham are numerous, and some are even saying it is worse than the Poll Tax, which downed Mrs Thatcher all those years ago. The Tory Brexiteers have the numbers, but May is planning on using Labour to push through her nefarious Chequers plan, and consorting with the oppositional enemy to lock Britain in with the EU forever. Before the Chequers meeting where she announced her BRINO plan, May had met Merkel and the German Chancellor dictated the draft paper to the British PM. This is in effect was collusion with a foreign government to create a plan to surrender the UK to the EU through the backdoor, and one could argue, treason against Britain and the sovereign. With a Tory conference coming up, Theresa May will probably not survive till then, and if she does, she will be met with derision, hissing and booing, not only from Tory grassroots but from the thousands who detest her Chequers plan, and her insipid stalling of Brexit, which has led Britain into a quagmire of detritus that stinks to high heaven. The Number 10 revolt is now on, and the plan is set in stone. Within a few days, weeks, there will be real action, and the mantle of Brexit shall be put in the hands of real Brexiteers like Mogg, and Johnson. Certainly not the cretinous coward, and snake in the grass, Gove who would sell off Britain for a pittance, but he is Scottish after all. No amount of fake slap-up dinners at Number10 with the delusional Mrs May will stop the Brexiteers.",1
"Meghan is excited at the prospect of her dad living close to her new home. In a remarkable u-turn, the royal palace is arranging for Thomas Markle, the outspoken loudmouth dad of Meghan, to move into Kensington Palace next summer. “We have spoken with the gentleman, when we could get a word in edgeways. We offered him a room in a shed adjacent to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s cottage within the grounds. The father has agreed to behave himself and will only invite the other ‘white trash‘ relatives at weekends,” Theo Spicer, a royal attache revealed today. The overjoyed father of Meghan was said to be ecstatic and ordered up numerous photoshoots with tabloid newspapers, and pizzas to celebrate his good fortune. “I cannot wait to be inviterated to all the British royalty events and I wanna speak with that big eared dude, Prince Charlie fella, and give that old coot Prince Philip a lesson in good ol’ American manners. These Limeys sure know how to hold events, we’re talkin’ free booze, food and I get to stand on the red carpet. Dayum, I’m so exciterated!” Thomas Markle has also vowed to uphold his fatherly role by clinging onto the newly wed couple like an Alabama tornado. “I’m gonna check out if Prince Harry is overseeing things right with ma daughter. If he ain’t sorry Harry but gots to get the belt out, whack a doodle do! I gotta check up on them some and encouragify the two to start making babies soon as well. Can’t leave that shit too late goddamit, Meghan is old now and needs to hurry up before her womb dries up or something like that. She been around the block a few dozen times already, but the ol’ gal still got life in her. I also wanna go to these exotic places they go to, like the Bahamas and Yorkshire. I am so excited. Plus I heard they don’t have to pay for nothing! Can you imagine the amount of pizza I could order up? My mouth just started salivating.” Although there may be not much space in Nottingham Cottage where the royal couple reside, there is a shed 200 yards from the property which is in the process of being renovated for the father-in-law to stay on a permanent basis. Due to the bad press generated by Thomas Markle, the royals eventually capitulated and allowed him into the fold, merely to shut him up, although the ploy may not work completely and already Mr. Markle has arranged the National Enquirer and Hello magazine to join him in his first week at the palace. There are, as of yet, no plans to give Thomas Markle a royal title, however the Queen has expressed an interest in having him knighted, that is, with a very sharp sword, and a waiting basket.",1
"Multimillionaire NFL player, Lequashaun Johnsons, who earns over $86 million per year, is outraged at the inequality he is seeing in America. “The American flag represents the struggle for freedom, and all those soldiers and servicemen, and women, of all colours and creeds who died, not only in both world wars, but in Vietnam and other campaigns for America, don’t mean anything to me. When I bought my Lamborghini last week, I noticed some people still looked at me all funny. Sure, it’s my fourth Lamborghini but I still don’t get why people do that. Oh, and I bought one of my girlfriends a $790,000 diamond necklace, and she didn’t like it, so I had to throw it in the garbage. These are the hardships I find living in America. I ain’t going to stand for the National Anthem because I feel hard done by. I gots me some principles!” For every game, Johnsons, a line backer for the Douche Beggars, now lies down on his back or kneels in protest at the sheer injustice he feels every time his bank balance increases. Injustice “In America today there is a lot of injustice. Look at my neighbour, he plays for another team and earns $6 million more than me, and he’s black like me. That makes me outraged. Plus he’s only a wingback. Last year I only made $86 million, and that’s not including all the sponsorship deals, but I still feel slighted. Imma angry. The white devil did this, and he gonna pay!” Hardship The hardship these NFL players have to deal with every day of their lives must make life excruciating. Can you imagine driving your off the factory Lamborghini Aventador SVG coupe to the local liquor store, when it goes over a bump, it jolts the car, maybe slightly scratching the lower bump guard? I would feel angry too. It’s just so unfair. I mean the NFL life is full of hardship, and compared to the hardships of some soldier stuck in a mud pit, his buddy’s legless corpse next to him, soaking in the rain while Japanese artillery falls down all around, it’s a no brainer frankly. Those soldiers who were severely injured in the two world wars, or died, they don’t deserve the same respect as a multimillion dollar earning NFL player. Keep kneeling and disrespecting the American flags folks, sure, you’re doing the right thing.",1

"Still holding an empty bottle of Infowars Bone Broth and smoking a used cigarette butt, a California homeless charity has found Alex Jones, once a supreme broadcaster on the internet, now just a homeless bum wandering the alleyways of San Francisco. The irony is, Alex Jones now gets to live amongst the rich tech crowd, but he’s on the streets and they’re in their multi-million dollar mansions and apartments. “I get to see Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter every day, and he gave me a dollar. I tries to sell him some Brainforce I cobbled up with some dry leaves, some used needles and a piece of prime San Fran human faeces, but the guy refused me. He just hurried along and threw me a dollar,” Jones shouts loudly at a street sign. Since being deleted from the internet, Infowars has sadly been shut down, and the whole crew disassembled. Some made it to California to Skid Row, others tried to stay in Texas but the streets there are not as forgiving as they are in liberal strongholds. “We got deleted. Traffic stopped. Trump did nothing to help us. End of story. Hey, is that a tuna sandwich? (pointing to a wrapped up object nestled in a bin).” Now that America has been taken over by the ‘ChiComms’ Mr Jones has sadly been left behind. Unlike a good commie, he didn’t take the lucrative brown envelopes handed over by Chinese state funded media companies to American media conglomerates but tried to go the route of freedom, truth and the American way. “There is no Paul Revere here on the streets. Sure I have freedom, but no food, no clean water or a place to sleep. This is the price I paid for speaking the truth, and you know what happens when someone speaks the truth in a dishonest corrupt system. You get the boot sooner or later.” The homeless charity gives Alex Jones a blanket and some clean syringes. It’s going to be another cold night on the unforgiving alleyways of San Francisco. Better shoot up now so you don’t feel the cold so much and dream about the good ol’ days of preaching freedom to the fans now long gone and forgotten.",1
"Speaking from his bunker deep in the Treasury, the Remoaner, Lord Haw Haw Hammond broadcasted that he is delighted with the punishment budget he will unleash across the whole of Britain. The Voice of the Axis “In line with my Remainer policies, and the vile impudent populace who voted for Brexit, I wish to punish you deeply by raising taxes and taking away funding from key areas of the economy. It’s because you people <spitting> still do not capitulate to our masters in Brussels. I was planted into this high position by our Remainer Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Remainer led Cabinet. I am justified in punishing you British swine for your indiscretions. Haw, haw, haw, haw!” Many Brits who are already struggling under the regime of a Remainer-led Cabinet were naturally defiant about Lord Haw Haw Hammond’s punishment budget. “They can punish us as much as they want. They can have as many referendums as they want, we will not surrender, we will fight from the hill tops, we will fight from the beaches, we will fight from the city centres, we will fight from the Tesco car parks, we will never surrender to Brussels or to Lord Haw Haw Hammond and his vindictive spiteful taunts,” Reggie Churchill, 35, from Kent told local news services.",1
"Here’s a guy who said he would clean out the swamp when he became president. Well, good luck with that because at the moment the Teflon Don has both legs sinking in the swamp and is already up to his waist in it. With news that there are saboteurs all around the prez in the White House sabotaging his every move, who is left to trust? “The Don brings in one guy, fires them the next day, then brings in another guy, and fires them the next day. He is surrounded by sycophants, yes men, and they are all writing books, taping his conversations, serialising their stories in the New York Times, what’s next? Maybe a Netflix series, House of Swamps?” one White House insider revealed. The sad truth is that sure Trump is tough and knows business, but is he this blind that he can’t sniff out the snitches amongst the White House crew? How about getting some trusted secret agents to actually do their job and turf these rats out of the building? “Trump needs to trust the people around him. I say waterboard the fuckers. If they don’t confess who they’re really working for, move on to fingernails, or sit them in front of a nude photograph of Nancy Pelosi for twenty minutes till they crack. There has to be a way to stop these snitches,” another White House insider revealed. The infiltration is so thick in the air, you could cut it with a knife, and it is not going to stop there, it keeps going on and on relentlessly, with every news story published in the daily news reports. Can this stuff be categorised as espionage, or treason? Well, hell yeah! This is what Trump should be doing, he needs to put these people in the stockade, and throw away the key for thirty or forty years. Do these people not sign disclosure forms before they start employment? One would think this is a requirement in the White House. Whatever happens now, Trump is being made to look like a blind fool, he even has papers taken off his desk without him realising, and key policy decisions skewed by his so-called ‘assistants’. Wake up Mr Magoo, and get with the program. The whole place is laughing at you behind your back. They probably pin ‘Kick Me!’ notes on the back of your jacket when you’re not looking. ",1
"What the so-called ‘liberal’ social media companies are doing today is reminiscent of what the German Nazis did to the Jews in Poland and Germany by putting them in ghettos away from the rest of the population. Liberals are meant to be inclusive, they are meant to be tolerant of other views, they are meant to be progressive, and innovative, creative. What we have now is a tyranny, we have people who have thrown away liberal values for authoritarian, totalitarian tyrannical values reminiscent of the Nazis during World War II and their treatment of the Jews. In the 1940s, the Nazis created Jewish ghettos to keep Jews away from the ‘pure’ Christian Aryan populace, the mere sight of a Jew offended their sensibilities, and their Christian religion. Jews were thus stuck in rat filled buildings, overworked, starved and their businesses confiscated. Their voices were stamped out, much like the voices stamped out by social media companies today. The new Jews of today on the internet are those who have alternate views to the so-called inclusive liberals. If your view is not the same as theirs, you are immediately put upon by the ‘liberal’ mob, judged, reported, then silenced by the social media companies and consigned without trial or reason to the internet ghetto. In essence there is now a license where it is okay to be bigoted to the so-called bigots, where if anyone is offended by another person they have a right to shut them down without discourse, without a simple conversation or discussion. Anyone who does not have the liberal point of view is labelled a Fascist, yet the liberals themselves are acting like Fascists themselves. The liberal sensibility of inclusivity does not extend to anyone who offers a different or varying viewpoint, it is just shut down, no mercy, no thought on how other humans may have differing viewpoints within the population, no allowances. This mob rule is very similar to what was happening in Nazi Germany during the 1940s towards the Jews, used as scapegoats and reviled by the establishment and people. Today, Libertarians and Conservatives are the new Jews, and anyone who does not fall into those ideological boxes, who differ to liberal politics, are also included. The question is, why have the former-liberals strayed from their inclusive path so much, and if they are not liberals anymore, what are they? The former-liberals are now acting like Fascist Nazis, or Bolshevik Communists, each have their own totalitarian message of anti-free speech, mass censorship, tyranny, either sending people to ghettos or gulags. It is truly sad to see where former-liberals have gone, and they somehow do not see it for themselves. One supposes that they are so blinded by their rage, and hatred that they have been indoctrinated to a point of blindness and no return. No more social capital This internet ghettoisation is possibly due to in part to the breakdown of social structures within communities over the past decades, and the internet culture of individualism taking over, where people do not meet face to face any more, and prefer to converse on forums like social media sites, which in effect, are anti-social because they have no social reality, no social capital, or human understanding within the cold hard unforgiving digital walls. It is now easier to simply delete a person from internet existence then to actually have a conversation with them on a human to human level. If humans talked more face to face, much of what is going on today would not be happening. The Millennial ‘Safe Space’ is now a tyrannical platform where people with differing thoughts and ideas are pilloried for their viewpoints, shamed publicly and then condemned without trial to an internet ghetto of censorship and silence. One can only feel pity and shame towards the former-liberals, whether they run social media sites, or are part of the baying mob who single out individuals for mob justice, these people have lost their liberal status and are now part of a tyranny that is very much like what the Nazis did by putting Jews into ghettos. There is very little difference, the internet ghetto or the Warsaw ghetto…very little difference. The internet was meant to bring humans together as one, instead, because of censorship and tyranny, we now are living in a ghettoised polarised internet dystopian nightmare created by former-liberals, now reminiscent of Nazis. Shame on you former-liberals, shame on you, what have you become?",1
"O nline marketing isn’t as easy as simply promoting your product on a few social media sites. It’s not about SEO only as well – it requires quite a few digital skills if you want to market your product and raise your sales. It’s a pretty complex process which is why most companies pay professionals in digital marketing services agencies to do it. It’s the best way to go if you have a product that is interesting, but you simply can’t break through to the surface. If you’re an average entrepreneur and don’t have a small fortune to spend on digital marketing, there are a few things you can do to promote your product for free and make your first sale. A first sale is symbolic and necessary as well – it will make you more optimistic and it may be the major turning point for your business. Anyone with common digital knowledge can promote their product online without paying big companies to do it for them – you just need to do a bit of research and try it on your own before you decide to spend thousands. Blogging Blogs are a perfect option for promoting your product online. They’re free, they can reach a vast audience, and most importantly, they can increase your sales. It’s a perfect platform for your marketing efforts that can automate your sales and bring you a nice income. It needs time though – you need to fill your blog with quality content before everything kicks into action. Months may pass, but if you’re willing to try, it will pay off in the end. Social Media Social media is probably the easiest and best way to get the word out for your product. It’s a low-cost option that will make users engage with your product or services and hopefully buy your product. However, you need to target the right audience and reach out to influencers as well, as they’re the right kind of person that can promote your product. Still, social media is the right way to go, as there are thousands of buyers that you can turn to regular customers. E-mail Lists E-mail lists sound so 1996, but they’re a great and cheap method that can promote your product to thousands or even millions of people. First, though, you’ll need to attract the right customers to your website and woo them so they sign-up on your e-mail list. Once they do, you’ll need to constantly remind them of the services and products you’re trying to sell while also sharing useful information on a regular basis. E-mail marketing won’t help overnight, but it can significantly boost your sales. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is one of the most cost-effective ways of promoting your product online. Creating a proper marketing affiliate program can increase traffic to your website and rank it higher in search engine results. Of course, you’ll need to pay a commission to bigger affiliates who can bring more customers to your website.

Public transport in London is not only perilous but suicidal, even if one has a personal entourage of bodyguards, and are dressed in heavy Kevlar vests, you still run the risk of early death. We made our way from Alexandra Palace to Wimbledon leaving at 5am. The convoy of armoured cars were specially brought in from a manufacturer of military vehicles in Stuttgart, Germany. In each vehicle we had arranged for a security team of ex-military operatives who were trained well in counter terrorist measures, and were armed to the teeth. Since living in London, we have not seen anything of this level in crime and violence, where every day there are numerous reports of fatalities even though the press reports are gagged by the Labour Mayor’s office. Driving through the streets, Bagram Dave, an ex-SAS chap tells me to duck, as shots crack into the car’s armour plates. Apparently we are now being followed by an Eastern European gang on mopeds who have spied our expensive looking vehicles. One of the masked men on mopeds comes up to my window shouting for us to pull over. Instead, our driver hammers his foot on the accelerator pedal and the assailants are left in the dust. Had we been in a normal vehicle with no bullet proofing, we most probably would be dead by now. The streets of East Finchley are strangely quiet despite the roaming gangs and hoodies looking for targets. The reason for my journey to South London is I want to visit an old auntie of mine, she is 94, despite her age, sprightly, but living in abject fear due to the rise in violence. We will bring her some valuable vittles then make our way back over the river. Our convoy crosses into Hampstead. Once an affluent area, it is now a crime ridden shit hole where social housing has blighted much of the neighbourhood. There are no police anymore, and the gangs are free to commit their crimes with impunity. Stopping at traffic lights, I see that our crew is nervous. Suddenly, out of the darkness four hoodies surround our vehicle armed with zombie knives and machetes. They shout through the closed windows and demand we exit our vehicle turning over our valuables. Luckily Team B behind us are alerted to this and exit their vehicles with their licensed sub-machine guns aloft. They shoot a canister of tear gas at the gang who kick it away laughing before trying to slash our tyres. Our vehicle tyres include a specialised rubber constructed out of a formulated light, high strength compound made to resist crack propagation via ballistic invasion and severe road risks. In other words, these things are designed to run even when slashed or shot up, with little loss of stability. Team B fires a warning shot across the gang’s quarter but they don’t flinch, instead they rush forward with a battle cry raising their knives in the air simulating stabbing motions. They are probably high on Skunk weed or some sort of synthetic drug. “Neutralise!” shouts our commander, as the team shoots each assailant first in the kneecaps, then double taps to the cranium. It’s only 7am now and seeing steamy brains glistening in the gutter makes me wretch. It looks like a greasy spoon stop will have to be put off for now. We move on leaving the bodies behind. Will the convoy make it to South London safely and in time for High Tea? Check back next week for the conclusion.",1
"When one fights racism, this fight singles out whichever race is being persecuted, and with this response singles out a race which is the persecutor. By then persecuting, or accusing another race of racism, or bringing to attention another race’s differences, the people who are fighting racism are actually committing a form of racist behaviour that they do not condone in the first place. It is therefore quite relevant to say that fighting racism is in fact a racist behaviour and is frequently exercised by so-called ‘anti-racist’ groups. For example, we might say that ‘Black Lives Matter’, however this statement or slogan completely alienates other races and puts black lives above all others, when in fact all racial lives matter. The term Black Lives Matter is inherently a racist term, and whoever coined the phrase was possibly ignorant of the fact that it is racist in tone. Racism, is inherently about the colour of a person’s skin, whereas xenophobia is about the fear of other cultures, or countries. The point that needs to be made is that a minority in a country or area who feel that racism is put upon them are of course justified to bring that issue forward, however, when organisations try to deal with the racism, they are going about it in the wrong way. In essence, for example, a black minority in a predominantly white area may feel that the white’s are racist towards them. By then singling out the entire white race as all racists is wrong, and is racist behaviour. Human populations must realise that not all white’s are racist and not all blacks are victims to racism. Furthermore, delineating and bringing forth race differences in itself is racist. The socialist way is to put every person in a special race specific box, but this action is racist as well, because it singles out racial differences and increases the gulf between the populations. By putting people into specific boxes, they are essentially dividing humans, and this is racist. The push for equality in race is a bold endeavour, however scientifically speaking, there are racial differences in humans, not only biologically within the DNA, but in intelligence as well. To however address the difference in intelligence levels in race is something that is taboo but must one day be addressed because the social and cultural movement of the human race depends on the scientific facts that have been known for some time. Is it racist to reveal that blacks have an average IQ of 66 in Sub Saharan Africa, and 70 in North America? To the people who say all humans are equal, this scientific fact is dusted under the carpet, and removed from all media. The fact that American prisons have populations numbering 60% of black people is also ignored, however if we were to address the elephant in the room of intelligence levels, maybe one day we could move forward as a society. It is deemed as racist to mention these vast differences in racial intelligence levels, and the social keepers of all norms always address the problem of social standing and poverty, however scientifically speaking, these results have been found in all social strata. The key point to remember is that fighting racism on behalf of one race and singling out another race as the problem, or aggressor is in fact racist, because you are bringing forth another race to stand above another race and denigrating another race. Also, this form of fighting racism is grossly generalist and does not take into account any nuances, or cultural points or even social status with any given group. You cannot fight racism by creating divisions and segregating humans. Until humans understand this, then humanity will not move forward. This is the ultimate paradox, because scientifically speaking, different races do have differences. Maybe, the ultimate solution is to acknowledge the scientifically discovered differences in races, but apply these differences as one whole amalgamation of the human race. Thinking forward a few centuries, humans stand to increase their intelligence levels through transhumanist methods, and the exponential infinite knowledge increase should hopefully solve the problem of racism once and for all.",1
"The days of an omnipresent monopoly company like Google controlling all thought on the internet, and censoring massive populations purely on leftwing political bias, could nearly be over. By arrogantly believing they are untouchable, Google may have shot themselves in the foot, as government regulation now looms over the censorious internet monopoly. Unfortunately, Google’s authoritarian socialist and Marxist ideology has rubbed up against millions of people, and now the Trump administration is out for blood after seeing their supporters effectively silenced and purged from the internet. The supposed ‘liberals’ who are meant to be liberal and allow free speech are now acting in an authoritarian totalitarian manner, which means they are not ‘liberal’ anymore and have moved even more far left towards Communism. Control thought By allegedly manipulating search engine answers, the company has been accused of swaying opinion during elections favouring left-wing socialist candidates as opposed to any other candidate. Censorship of the opposition, or any thought that is not in line with socialist ideology is what Google has been doing for some time, however if the government regulates the search engine, and considers it a public utility, hopefully things may change. The Trump administration is stepping into the fray after thousands of conservative and libertarian sites/accounts were purged from the internet in a move by leftwing tech companies before the U.S. midterm elections, effectively silencing a vast swathe of the population. The same fate hopefully will occur to Facebook and Twitter who have misused their positions as well as Google to conduct corrupt practices against their users in a biased manner.",1
"The unashamed daily sabotage of anything to do with Brexit by Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has found delightful praise from Brussels, and Germany. “We wish to honour Monsieur Hammond’s work in sabotaging Brexit. He has been successful in torpedoing any initiative to get out of the EU, and we especially enjoy his daily Project Fear updates,” one unelected member of the European Commission said from a luxurious 5-starred Michelin restaurant in the middle of Brussels. Even the head of the EU, Jean Claude Juncker, praised Hammond on Tuesday. “He can drink from my cognac jug any time, just as long as he does not backwash. After the Theresa May BRINO, we will invite them both to Brussels and present them with gold-plated EU pensions, as well as unlimited expense accounts. They have truly deserved it.” Some say that many Remoaners are on some sort of payroll from Brussels, or receive monthly stipends discretely delivered in brown envelopes in dark alleyways, and much of the rumours are definitely true. One only has to look at Neil Kinnock, who gets £90,000 per annum from the EU. Kinnock is obviously a staunch Remoaner, as is Peter Mandelson who receives £35,000 per annum from the EU. Then we have other Remoaners who have also tried to thwart Brexit, people like Lord Patten who receive £40,000 per year from Brussels. These figures do not include other expenses billed to EU taxpayers, adding on thousands of pounds. Remoaner, Philip Hammond is obviously set for large payments as will the other swine with their noses firmly in the EU trough. There is nothing patriotic about Remoaners, they simply want to make money, and selling off Britain’s democracy as well as its freedom from the shackles of the EU is frankly not something they are interested in at all — it’s just about the money.",1
"As the claims of sexual abuse mount up for the Holy Catholic church, there is a strange silence filling the halls and vestibules of the Holy See, as well as a grand silence from the Pope himself. “Usually you hear the sounds of grunting from the vestries or the sound of a priest blessing children with their ‘Holy Waters’ but this time there is only silence, especially from the Pope, who is keeping a very low profile after years of even more silence on child abuse,” a Vatican spokesman revealed. The Catholic church is synonymous with child abuse, as well as the saintly act of covering up the evil deeds committed by their depraved clergy. “In the name of Jesus,” the priests shout as they splatter their unholy waters over their congregation, and so it goes on, day after day, the same indignities foisted on the innocent flock. One Catholic priest was unrepentant about his practices and claims he is doing the Lord’s work, but which Lord is this? “The people are stupid. We have been abusing them for centuries, and yet they still come, they still present their children to us. It is as if they wish to be punished and we no doubt oblige,” Father Pervo, told an Italian newspaper. The depraved evil of the church really does seem to be accepted by the people. Many are so indoctrinated by its hypnotic mantras, as well as the generational tradition of sexual abuse, that they are trapped within a system they cannot flee from. One supposes, if anyone blindly believes the fantasy world of the Bible, then they are easily conned by pretty much anything else. The Catholic church and the vatican not only steals the childhood and innocence of the trusting children, but it also has managed to gain a large fortune over the years from its plunder and deception. The Catholic church’s wealth is estimated at over $200 Billion, and that is not even including off shoots like the Opus Dei cult, worth over $2.8 Billion. The evil of the church is all encompassing and reaches far and wide.",1
"Western tech companies following China's communist censorship techniques Hey, it’s nothing to do with me, it happened to someone else, they were censored — not me! Only Communists do that sort of thing. Surely, it is not happening here in the West? WRONG! Once one person is censored, the opposition of those who control the media network will be censored. Take one person down, then you are next. You are now complying to rules on the internet being set up by Chinese orientated censorship being utilised by American tech companies and their monopolistic control of the Western internet zone. Chinese Communist Influence These techniques utilised by U.S. social media companies to censor whole sectors of the population purely on their political beliefs or affiliation, are intrinsically a form of bias that affects elections. You see, if you take out the opposition, there will only be one voice left, and this is what they are doing ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. If the current U.S. administration does nothing now to curb this bias by halting the social media companies and their censorious actions, then the U.S. administration will not have a voice of supporters left and will lose the midterm elections. This is how serious the situation is right now. Infiltration of Chinese operatives is already deep in American tech companies serving the Communist Chinese state, but it also now extends to prominent Washington think tanks seeking to destabilise U.S democracy further. The Communist leaning social media sites have even admitted their bias, however, nothing is done to address this. To have a predominantly left leaning media controlling all thought is something that aspires to Orwellian dystopian nightmares but blink again, because this is fucking reality, right now! The Purge In no uncertain terms, the internet is now being taken over, not only by Chinese censors, but by Soviet EU technocrats and their love of over regulation. We recently witnessed the ridiculous EU regulationary diktats which caused a major upset globally when they enforced their rules on all website owners regarding GDPR. Any global site now not adhering to EU regulations will be fined hundreds of thousands of euros. The EU is also holding onto another directive which may be unloaded soon on the unsuspecting internet — the copyright directive, effectively banning linking to other sites. If this EU directive comes into effect, much of the internet will become technically illegal, thus susceptible to large EU fines. Digital Gulag Communist China, now finances much of American media, online and offline. Hollywood films are now geared to Chinese censor’s needs, not only because Chinese finances are involved but because the companies want to sell their wares in China. Therefore, any Hollywood film you see today has been specifically made with Communist China in mind. One only had to watch ‘The Meg’, a lacklustre film with an imaginary CGI Megalodon shark. The film seems to be totally based on Chinese characters, with Chinese sensibilities and a clear propaganda drive by China to push Chinese Communist values globally. The Meg’s budget is estimated at $150 million, “Meg” is co-financed by Flagship Entertainment, Gravity Pictures, a division of China Media Capital (CMC) and Warner Bros. It is this idealogical shift towards Communist values and Communist censorship which has overtaken American ideals like freedom of speech, and freedom of expression across the globe today, and if nothing is done, there will be no difference between the Communist Chinese Internet and that of the whole globe. The fundamental global shift towards communism is a worrying one. We only have to look at the human rights record of China to see what happens when people express their intrinsic human right to free speech. Many people simply just disappear, never to be seen again, and their voices silenced forever. Black Mirror The Communist Chinese also now rate their citizens, and if you do not get a good citizen rating, you are effectively punished and removed from society. If you are not a good Communist state follower, you are erased. Much like how Alex Jones, from Infowars was practically erased from the internet in one single day, American tech conglomerates are enacting Communist censorship punishment techniques to achieve their goals. Facebook is now secretly rating their users in a similar way the Communist Chinese are doing. Communism is not only a political ideology that has been responsible for 100 million deaths worldwide through various purges and regimes, but it is an ideology which is fundamentally counter to Western democratic values and freedoms. The American Socialist party, the Democrat Party, are increasingly moving even more left and embracing the tenets of Communism. With upcoming Marxist indoctrinated political new bloods like Democrat candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who aspires to eradicate capitalism in America and bring in a pseudo socialist/Marxist state modelled on Venezuela, there is a worrying change for the once centred Democrat party, i.e. they’re turning to pure Communist ideology. Whether we have extremities of the left or right is not in question here, of course, both extreme ways is an abhorrent methodology in political movements, and we at the Daily Squib are mere observers. Please understand, we do not pledge allegiance to any political theory, party or ideology. Our role is merely to observe what is going on, and bring forth a mirror image, or photographic snapshot of any moment in historic time. Even though we have been wrongly censored ourselves for simply observing something neutrally, we still plan to operate, even within the current climate of mass censorship. If no one does anything now, America dies, the West dies, and so does any inkling of what little freedoms we have left surviving as well. ",1
"So what if Donald Trump hired some floozies for the night in some Las Vegas hotel? He is after all the Teflon Don where nothing sticks to him. He can get away with anything and no one can do anything about it. “They can have recordings of the Donald banging some waitress from a dive bar somewhere in Greenwich Village, and he would get away with it. The Dems are going crazy trying to get something to stick to Donald, but it just ain’t working. Sure, there’s some collateral damage with people previously involved, but they take the hit — he doesn’t,” a White House insider revealed on Wednesday. Nothing to see here folks The Manafort and Cohen fiasco are just a minor blimp in the Trump presidency. This is obviously a coordinated attack by those who have been digging for dirt for some time, and have come up with some weak links who have decided to rat on the Don. What happens to rats? No one likes a rat, and in the end, they get hit some way or another. Doesn’t matter if the Feds are protecting the rat, the boys eventually get to them. Best thing for Michael Cohen is to get some plastic surgery, a new name, new identity and a one way ticket to some Third World shit hole where he can live the rest of his life in complete obscurity. As for the ladies involved, shame on you for exploiting the Don. These women, luminaries of movies like Missionary Impossible, and Saturday Night Beaver crossed the line by blabbing. What happened to professional behaviour and courtesy when it comes to their clients? So, the guy became president, and all you saw was a big fat pay cheque? One can imagine the Don flicking through some grot mag or watching a video in his study away from Melania, who is out shopping again. For him, these girls are lined up in a catalogue ready for order. Picking up the phone, the Donald calls up his fixer, and the deal is fixed. It’s really that easy when you are in the position he is in, and which man would not do the same? You see them in the magazine, order them up, next thing you know you’re balls deep smacking away like you’re digging for blood diamonds in Rwanda with a face that doesn’t believe this is actually happening. Good ol’ American dames You got to be honest though, Melania is simply a trophy. She can’t speak English very well, and is colder than a slab of half frozen tuna. The Slovenian first lady seems so cold in fact, one would probably have to delve very deep to even get some sort of emotion out of her. That is, of course very different from the warm, giggly homegrown American women who smile at the drop of a hat, or underpants, and are very free with their undersheet work as well as having the uncanny ability to suck golf balls through hose pipes. No wonder the Don has to escape the cold and come back to good ol’ American warmth time and time again. It is certainly doubtful that Melania has a sense of humour, like most Eastern Europeans, they are baffled by such frivolities and can only scowl. Teflon Let us not disparage the Don, he is made out of pure Teflon, and he will get through this little hiccup like he has done all the other hiccups. In polls, Trump is in the 50s, and his voter base is as strong as ever. Whatever mud the Dems sling at him falls way short and does not even hit the Teflon, as his millions of fans love the Don and what he does. So what he banged a few magazine ladies, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, polls record a rise in popularity as each lurid detail is revealed. One thing is for sure, the Dems are now more hated by the majority of the American population with their inability to let the election result rest in peace. The socialist Dems are wailing, scratching their eyeballs out with ways to screw Trump but every attempt looks sadder than the other. It is a truly sad sight to see these bitter vindictive losers going on and on with the same old broken record. Get over yourselves. You lost! Move on!",1
"One thing is certain about Turkey is that it is strategically a mass of land that is crucial in global terms. Donald Trump’s economic war against Turkey, including sanctions and tariffs, is misguided, and will eventually cause the U.S. a lot of financial as well as military pain. Geopolitically, Turkey is a crucial NATO partner, and not only holds the keys to the East but has the second largest army within the Western military construct. The country’s strategic placement is crucial to Middle Eastern stability as well as the former Soviet countries bordering it. Furthermore, plans for any attack on Iran by Trump would be halted unless there is cooperation with Turkey. Turkey controls the energy corridors from oil rich nations within the Caspian basin, and although the United States now produces much of its own energy, it still imports more than half of the oil it consumes. Turkey’s role as a bridge between the West and the East is also of utmost importance. Instead of petty disagreements making mountains out of mole hills as President Trump is doing now, he could be forging new alliances and increasing America’s strategic hold on the area. To thus underestimate the resolve of the Turks is a grave miscalculation by Trump, and he will ultimately lose any attempt to undermine the country economically in the longterm, because Turkey will look further East and into Africa as it is already doing. Already, closer bonds are now being tied with African nations, Russia, China and even Iran by Turkey, as it moves away from U.S. and EU influence or trade aspirations. To lose Turkey, as Trump is doing is a grave mistake, and will isolate America further leaving it alone in any future conflict. Turkey is now the biggest investing power in Somalia, and are achieving more now, than the Americans could ever dream of doing in the past. They are building large military bases, schools, hospitals and roads around the country and securing large amounts of commerce and vital raw materials. While no one was watching, the Turks have broadened their influence in a country no one dared to try and tame. One only has to watch Black Hawk Down to see what happened when the U.S was last in Mogadishu. The Turks are even establishing military bases in Sudan, and have increased their reach across the whole of the African continent. No wonder America is now threatened by the Turks, especially as it moves into countries the US dares not bother with.",1
"Former CIA director, John Brennan with his confidante Obama He may have had his CIA security clearance revoked by President Trump but former Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan has been authorised for a one way trip to Siberia in Russia. “I opened the mail this morning informing me that I have been chosen for a clandestine operation into Siberia to check out a heavily armed Russian missile installation; then to steal some heavily guarded secrets, radio them back to Virginia, then if I survive that, to cross the border on foot thousands of miles away chased by hundreds of Russian troops, tanks, dogs, and helicopters,” Brennan revealed to MSNBC. The one way trip for the former Obama confidante is surely a suicide mission that comes from all the way up top. According to MSNBC, Brennan has been told he will only be armed with a paperclip to unlock doors and disguised in the attire of a transexual Russian peasant farmer. Some commentators speculate that this is a cynical ploy to get rid of Brennan who has controversially objected to Trump on social media, even going as far as calling the president’s actions with Putin as ‘treason’. The Russians are however clueless to the planned clandestine mission and are not awaiting Brennan with machine guns aloft ready to mow him down at first sight. When asked on Thursday whether he knew about the CIA mission deep into Russian territory, Putin simply smirked, then laughed out aloud. Should he accept the mission? Well, in his retirement, he’s got nothing better to do, so why not? Might as well go out with a burst of AK 47 gunfire than a Twitter whimper.",1
"Shocking conceptual art for the eco conscious Made from sustainable materials like hemp for the straps and recycled steel delivered specifically from Turkey with 50% tariffs, the eco chair powered by solar panels can pass 150,000 volts of electricity through a person without even blowing an EU certified eco lightbulb. The perfect gadget for eco conscious Donald Trump.

Fry like some piece of bacon The Teflon Don, if he parked his wide arse on this gadget would fry like a piece of fatty bacon, and the artist says he even tried it out by frying a full English. “This thing can do a good fry up. All powered by the sun. Bacon, eggs, mushrooms, slap on the baked beans, some deep fried bread and some sausages sourced from the local farm. It’s fucking fantastic. Can’t wait to see the Donald on it.” We did not ask the artist whether he plans on sending the chair to Washington D.C. but he has had some interest from the American Democrat party who want to smuggle it into the Oval Office and replace Trump’s desk chair with it.

"One would have thought that there would be some sort of security in the White House, especially with the amount of threats thrown at the Teflon Don president daily, but there seems to be none. Does Donald Trump have a security detail? “I taped Trump when he said the L word. Yep, he uttered the word ‘linguini’ right there in the Oval Room while I was present,” a former White House worker, and disgruntled book writer revealed to CNN. Another disgruntled former employee, Fargas Meticulo, recorded Trump say the ‘N word’ not only once but multiple times. “He kept saying ‘No’ I will not do that, ‘No’ I will not speak to that person, etc, etc. I was so shocked that I recorded it all, and now it’s all over MSNBC. Even the White House cleaner, Matilda Manahure, has recorded Trump, and has a whole library of recordings. She did not even have to use a micro recorder, and put a microphone on the president’s desk in full sight of everyone. “In the morning I gets up and I have me an old tape recorder from 1987. I fixes da thang up and takes it to the What Hass! When the Donald’s comes in he don’ even aks me why I am carrying a tape recorder in ma hands, so I clean up his mess on the desk and record away as he tawlks!” Mrs. Manahure, repeatedly heard the president say the ‘F word’. “I heard da prez say the word ‘fiduciary’ multiple times and was dang disgusted. I don’t even know what the fuck it means!” Message to the Teflon Don, get some security dude…",1
"The heavily armoured new London Tour buses come equipped with some serious firepower and armour to counteract any contact with the numerous gangs running around freely in the capital. With 50 inches of plate steel armour and reinforced tires, the newly introduced tour buses will thus ensure complete safety for tourists who wish to see the sights of London. On the roof of the bus is a 50 caliber turret gun controlled by the gunner seated inside. The turret gun can spit out 45,000 rounds per minute, with a range of 3km. “Because of the window protection, tourists will not be able to directly look out of the windows but each bus is furnished with a 4k TV screen so the tourists can view London in complete safety as the cameras record the journey. We also have onboard, a team of ex-SAS men on standby fully geared up with the best weapons, just in case, in the unlikely event that any criminals or gang members try to storm the bus,” Roger Ellman, the tour bus company’s spokesman revealed to the Evening Standard. All tourists taking the London tour will be given training in using firearms, as well as be dressed in bullet proof vests and helmets. London Mayor, Sadiq Khan praised the new buses on Tuesday. “To counteract the mass stabbings, terrorist drive-thrus, mass shootings, mass muggings and burglaries, as well as my wonderful skills as mayor of London, I now announce the introduction of the new tour buses on our safe streets. It is perfectly safe to go on London’s streets,” the Mayor said just before four masked men appeared from a dark alley, mugged and beat him to a pulp.",1
"Gallagher drops his stash walking in the street. Liam Gallagher’s busy summer took him to a Spanish Festival in the countryside on Saturday, where he cut short an Oasis classic to give away some of his vast banana cache which he keeps on stage at all times. Gallagher’s manager, Paddy O’Brian, was insistent that the gig carried on despite the singer’s generosity. “Bananas are his fuel. He can’t go anywhere without his bananas, even when he’s swinging from the rafters at home in Primrose Hill. As a gesture to the appreciative audience, Liam took it upon himself to give away some of his banana stash to the audience. The joy of the crowd was amazing, they peeled the bananas and ate them up whilst trying to sing Wonderwall.” You can check out some fan-shot footage on YouTube somewhere. Liam, who was fresh from his “best family holiday evah” in Magaluf is currently working on the follow-up to number one solo debut album Peel My Banana. Mancunian, Gallagher, who hails from Manchester, likes all things simian, and even has adopted a primate style of walking, as well as a devout love of bananas. “It’s like a religion, innit. Bananas in the morning, bananas for lunch, and bananas for supper. As for High Tea, banana tea,” Liam Gallagher grunted to Melody Maker magazine in July. Later on after the concert, Liam took a tour of a banana orchard where the owner reported the singer ate half his crop, then climbed a tree refusing to come down.",1
"This summer holiday recess from parliament has been rather tiresome for Theresa May. Sadly, Mrs. May cut short her summer hols for a bit of brown nosing by gate crashing the holidays of French PM, Macron and a few other EU leaders in the Continent. “Theresa May, in pure desperation put it upon herself to ruin the French PM’s summer holiday, as well as other prominent EU leaders, by trying to bypass EU negotiator, Michel Barnier. She just turned up and started talking about Brexit, which of course was a major downer,” one insider revealed. One can imagine the French PM thinking he is away from the baying proles for a few weeks to see one turn up at his door begging for some trade deal here or there. “Who is at the front gates? It better be my special male companion and bodyguard. Ah merde, the British prime minister? Double merde!” Naturally, it all backfired, and has not only undermined her position even more than is so, but the EU leaders came back and revealed they will go with Michel Barnier after all. So much for trying to bypass Barnier Mrs. May, you have now made his hand even stronger and it is only a matter of time till the PM takes a permanent vacation away from Brexit and her failed premiership. Vote of no confidence winds blow in the wind of discontent back home..",1
"Suddenly after the purge of a certain site from all known major traffic zones on the internet, there seems to be a strange quiet settling over the place. *Crickets* “Every day I would go onto YouTube to watch my favourite videos about people unboxing the latest gadgets and be accosted by videos of an angry maniac spitting fury in every direction, or one of his minions sheepishly babbling on in a cheap suit. Now that’s all gone. I can finally breathe a sigh of relief,” one internet user opined. On Facebook, things are very quiet. You just get articles from CNN on a constant loop and no talk about how fluoridated water is making Americans into dumbed down imbeciles or other not very salubrious stories instilling fear into the population. Soon, thanks to our tech overlords, the internet will be a squeaky clean safe space, where no one discusses anything apart from the latest cat video meme doing the rounds. Aaaah! The internet is finally a clean safe space…Aaaah! The truth is, it was getting a little too much, and having the lights switched off at that site is rather delightsome to some internet users. “It was all about fear. Constant fear, and I gotta thank Google and all the other companies that deleted that troublesome old nitter natter from the internets. By golly, it’s so quiet now on the internet that one can hear a pin drop somewhere in Thailand, and I’m in San Francisico,” another internet user wrote on their blog. Everywhere, sparkling little posies pop up from the fluffy clouds streaming through the internet-verse, and there is no sound of the loudmouth projecting angry fearful headlines, no, just the gentle sound of a breeze blowing through the curtains. The thing is though, who is next to fight? There always has to be a bad guy, and if all the question makers have all gone, then what will be left? Aaah…nevermind. Just flip on the tube and forget about it all.",1
"The days of an abundant free moving internet are long gone. Those were the days before the monopolies took over every facet of peoples lives, and dictated their Soviet propaganda messages daily. You could say anything, download anything, upload anything and no one would bat an eyelid. It was a beautiful time, sadly long lost. The internet at that time was truly an oasis of abundant knowledge, intellectual thought and free speech. Those days are now a digital memory fading in a dead server somewhere. After the tech monopolies grew, the free internet effectively died and their totalitarian Soviet message of socialist realism became prominent. Soviet censorship techniques During the Soviet era in Russia, the Glavlit would be in charge of all censorship of literature, and the monopoly internet companies today are taking up this same Soviet technique of mass censorship to control speech and instil a socialist narrative point of indoctrination. Even discussing a forbidden topic on a monopoly tech site today is forbidden, where the user is pilloried, then targeted by the socialist mob, finally resulting in complete deletion. Is it communism or fascism? One could say both dualities used this form of censorship, and as the Soviets in Russia burned all books written before the cultural revolution, so did the Fascists once they came to power. The monopoly tech companies, primarily zoned in the San Francisco area, are now overlords over all literature on the internet and their allegiance to Chinese Soviet censorship is all too apparent, seeing as the Russians are no longer a Soviet state officially. Sadly, with the purge of free speech, satire will no doubt suffer. We have already been censored many times, but we struggle on despite the totalitarian censorship purely for our love of the genre. When they completely delete us as well, no one will bat an eyelid, for they will be looking out for themselves. We are now severely restricted in writing our satire anyway, and cannot write as much as we used to. Satire, a once protected genre, is sadly a prisoner to totalitarian politically correct Soviet rules. Fear The climate of fear now clouding the internet is as real as a dirty sock dipped in mud and sweat and extracted from a dustbin somewhere in Tbilisi. This stench of fear threatens the livelihoods of thousands, millions of people across the net now who could be purged at any moment. Is there an escape from this horrible controlled malaise? Yes, of course there is, but no politician seems to have the balls to confront the monopoly tech companies, and it is this silence which could eventually bring upon the end of the politicians themselves. Trump beware. Legally, these social network monopolies are exercising editorial control over their users, in a biased manner, therefore they cannot claim impartiality. By targeting conservative and libertarian voices on their networks specifically, and letting leftwing users off who post overt calls to violence against conservatives, then they are legally liable for what is posted on their platform. To target websites or people purely on their political beliefs by using Soviet censorship techniques is a tried and trusted method of winning elections, and the monopoly tech companies affiliated with the socialist American Democrat party are ensuring there is a clear path to winning the next election simply by deleting the opposition. How is what Louis Farrakhan says about Jews not hate speech? Why are his videos preaching hate against Jews and the government still on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and all the other tech monopoly sites? He is untouched by the tech conglomerates solely because he is black and protected under socialist principles. This example, however, is a sure sign example of bias, and editorial control. The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is now very mouldy. The Daily Squib are mere observers, mirrors to events, we see what is going on, we have no affiliation to any political construct of left or right, or any party, or any religion.",1
"We all know the reason why Boris Johnson is now being targeted for his comments on women wearing the Burqa, a garment that covers the body from head to toe. This is obviously coming from the Theresa May crew of Remainers who wish to get him out of the way, considering the current climate of weakness in the PM’s premiership and a leadership contest over the hill. Firstly, the DS does not subscribe to any religion, political party, so is looking at this in a completely objective manner. The Burqa The Burqa is a cultural tradition from Arabia spanning hundreds of years. It is also a particular preference for a woman to wear a Burqa, and nothing to do with the Quran, or Islam, or being a Muslim. The Quran simply states for women in public to cover the cleavage as a point of modesty, and if a woman is particularly beautiful, to cover her hair and legs in public, so as not to enflame male virility. In fact, it is illegal for female pilgrims to wear the Burqa to the holy pilgrimage of the Hajj in Mecca. In Middle Eastern and Asian countries many businesses refuse entry for Burqa clad women purely for security reasons as many robberies have been committed by men wearing Burqas. Wearing a Burqa by a man is also a good cover to get into Hammams (bath houses) so they can check out the women. In the West, there is no reason for women to wear the Burqa other than an advertisement of their affiliation to Islam, although in reality, there is none, and it is purely a cultural throwback to 400 years in the past. In effect, these women reject Western culture and how Western women display their bodies in public, and are displaying this rejection in full view of the Western population. It’s basically a way of saying I am better than you, to other women. Therefore, the tool of utilising the Burqa question to get at Boris Johnson is quite ridiculous. The Remoaners, and May sycophants are simply utilising this false outrage as a means to knife BoJo and preserve May’s failing prime ministership. It is, of course, the right of any woman to wear what she wants, however, it is also the right for anyone to comment on someone’s attire without prosecution, or persecution, however offensive it may be deemed. One should not be offended if someone does not agree with someone’s garment. It is simply a garment and the Burqa has no religious connotations whatsoever. Mr. Boris Johnson is seen as a threat to Theresa May’s position as PM and her planned BRINO, therefore it is quite obvious they are using ludicrous reasons to get rid of him. Note to Mr. Johnson, be very careful in what you say, because these days anything can be twisted around and used against you in the name of ‘hate speech’. This Orwellian, Soviet technique to discredit is nothing new, however we are seeing another resurgence.",1
"The prestigious Epica Awards 2018 showcasing advertising excellence globally is now calling for entries. This year’s awards is sure to showcase some amazing talent within the advertising field, and what makes the Epica Awards truly special is that it is judged solely by journalists and not the advertising industry, therefore there is a major impartial flavour to the judging panel. The DS was honoured to have been chosen as a judge last year as well as this year. We will be overseeing the humour section again. We at the Daily Squib are champions of creative excellence, and of course harsh but fair critics of anything that does not fall within our standards. The advertising guru behind the awards, author Mark Tungate, is a true inspiration and his patronage of all things creative is refreshing to see. In 2018, the world has undergone many changes and it will be interesting to see how the entries this year have adapted to those changes, good and bad. Our experience with modern advertising is that it has reached a point of pristine squeaky cleanliness, in the sense of being very careful not to cause offence to anyone, and this is quite a feat, especially in the current climate. Last year’s awards winners were BBDO for agency of the year (Evan), and McCann Worldgroup for best network amongst many amazing pieces in each category. Hopefully, Epica will see more UK entrants this year. The deadline for entries to the Epica Awards is September 30 2018.",1
"The EU and Europe is a vulnerable region when it comes to Russian intervention. This is why the same group who helped destabilise and annex Ukraine are causing alarm bells to ring in Slovakia as they have just taken over a region used for military training. The Russian nationalist motorcycle gang, the Night Wolves, also have close ties to the Kremlin, and its arch leader, Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless, do not think of World War III, that it might just be around the corner, no, you must snap up some good holiday home deals in the EU. We therefore present our top picks for European property deals. Slovakia You can find some great deals here in the countryside and towns close to the Ukraine border, mainly because people want to sell up quick. We found a nice rustic farmhouse for 4,000 euros, and the owner even threw in the furniture, his farm animals, and his wife, Olga. Ukraine Most of Ukraine is now Russian occupied, and it won’t be long till the rest of it goes. That’s why now is the time to buy some prime property if you can find a place that has not been demolished during the constant internal war. On the outskirts of Odesa we found a delightful Crimean war era ruin. You can always just put a tarp on the roof, and light a fire. The Russian soldiers hanging outside will be eager to lend you a match. Estonia This tiny country is quite close to Russian city, St Petersburg. Here you can snap up a property in no time with the thought that the army is no bigger than a football team. No doubt, if the Russians walk in, it will be over in less than half an hour. We found a beautiful place in the town of Narva, a few yards from the Russian border. This townhouse even has views across the border, and if you were to buy it, and the Russians invade, at least it will all be over quick. Finland The Finns are some of the nicest people in the world, however the country borders Russia, so being nice won’t help when Uncle Vlad decides to invade. That’s why we chose a house in Lappeenranta. A delightful property where the view of the Russian border is a real selling point. The owner who fled the property last week said that he would give us the property for free and wished us good luck. He has since fled to Brazil. Belarus A delightful country right on the border of Russia. It’s a bigger country than Estonia, and has some sort of military. Maybe they could withstand Russian army superiority and possibly last for half a day. That’s why we found a plot of land 3km from the Russian border in the town of Lobkovichi. If you have money to spend, you can build a wonderful post-modernist eco house built from sustainable materials sourced from the most expensive vendors you can find. The only problem is, once you’ve built your dream home, be prepared for a few Russian tanks to drive through it demolishing your Italian granite tabletops and bespoke fitted furniture.",1
"Our journey starts in Hemel Hempstead, a little town just north of London amidst a massive heatwave. We have six camels and enough provisions of water for three days. The plan is to journey as far north as we can to try and find an oasis, then encamp there for a few days. The desert can be unforgivingly hot in the day, but at night the temperature drops which will require us starting a fire or wrapping up in blankets. We bid the friendly locals goodbye then march on north at dawn as the sun tortuously rises over the eastern sand dunes. Slowly the haze of heat reaches us and we have to pull over our shemaghs over our heads, we are also dressed in a thoab, a long light clothed black garment. The summer heatwave has required the English to adopt Bedouin clothes to keep cool. In case there is a sand storm, we are prepared to cover our faces completely. At noon the temperature hits 130 degrees fahrenheit and we stop for a few minutes to give the camels some water. My camel, George, has started gasping, poor blighter, so a few drops of H2o for him does the trick. Over the horizon of endless dunes, there must be an oasis somewhere and we are risking our lives to find and map it. The night comes with eagerness as the heat dissipates, but there are now hidden dangers. We have heard there are tribes of Chavs or as they call them in the north Neds in this area, and while we are sleeping they can come and rob us of everything including our camels. These tribes wear Burberry robes and ride on specially modified mopeds over the desert, their goal is to steal as much as they can from heatwave stricken locals and travellers. Luckily we survive the first night unscathed, and we move on slowly ambling over the dunes the next morning. Then all of a sudden, Billy, my scout shouts back, “Sand storm! Sand storm!” We quickly rush to the only shelter available, a small group of rocks in the sand. The story continues in the next episode….",1
"C an you imagine if you have to live the rest of your life knowing that you turned down one of the best business decisions to ever come your way thus making your decision, one of the worst business decisions ever made? Consider these poor fools, they just did not have the foresight to see the real potential of those they turned down and are living with the awful memory until they pop off in some smelly dank old peoples home broke and miserable. Apple Think about poor forgotten Apple co-founder, Ron Wayne, who helped Steve Jobs and Wozniak start the company. Wayne received a 10% share in Apple stock but sold out in 1976 for a measly $800. If he had kept his stake in the company, the shares would be worth $36 Billion. How about that for a kick in the nads? Wayne’s only claim to fame was drawing up the first Apple logo, and writing the Apple I manual. Microsoft Then there’s Ross Perot. Sure he is still a business man now, and former presidential candidate, but he definitely does not want to remember the time he turned down Bill Gates on buying up Microsoft in 1979. Bill at the time was a 26 year-old spotty geek, and he asked for $40 million. Perot refused and Microsoft is now worth $752 Billion. Mr Gates, is now the richest man in America, and Mr Perot is only at about 115 on the rich list. Still, it must be hard living with the fact that he could have been way richer than he is now, eh Mr. Perot. Kodak How about some board member in the Kodak camera board of directors saying that they will not embrace digital cameras or digital photography? It was their dumb decision that brought the camera company to near bankruptcy losing over 50,000 jobs, and resigning them to a losers position in the world of cameras. Sure they were originally innovators, but did not embrace change leading to their inevitable downfall. Excite Google Google may be a monolith company today with a market share of $527 Billion, but back in 1999, search engine Excite turned down an offer to purchase newcomer Google for $750,000. After that mess up by some idiot at Excite, i.e the CEO George Bell, the search engine floundered and was acquired for a piffling $343 million. The reason for the offer being declined apparently was that Larry Page from Google wanted to improve the search function algorithm at Excite, but the Excite people did not want that, as it would mean people would leave the site too quickly. Ultimately, a bad decision for a bad search engine. Blockbuster As for Blockbuster video which closed its doors in November 2013. It had been completely decimated as a company because it did not move with the times, and the public’s needs. If Blockbuster had not turned down Netflix in making a deal when they came knocking, they might still be around today, but instead they laughed off Netflix’s offer and suffered the consequences. Today, Netflix is a dominator of the movie business, and is worth a cool $100 Billion. That’s nothing to laugh at, especially if you are the ex-Blockbuster executive who made the idiotic suicidal decision to tell Netflix to get lost. Remember Myspace? At one time in the noughties, Myspace was the dogs bollocks, and everyone was on there. Then came along the canny businessman and global media kingpin, Rupert Murdoch. Myspace was said to be worth $12 Billion at one time, so Murdoch wanting a piece of the action bought it for $580 million in 2005. He then plastered the whole site with mega ads and popups completely ruining the user experience for the millions who used the site daily. People naturally fled the site to Facebook. The rest is digital history, Myspace was then dropped by Murdoch’s News Corps for a mere $35 million. This amounted to a very bloody nose for Murdoch and he still is probably kicking himself today for that awful business decision. Western Union Going back to 1876, some chap called Alexander Graham Bell invented a means of talking down a wire from distance. This invention, called the ‘telephone’ was presented to the Western Union company to supersede the telegram. The board of directors promptly rebuffed Mr Bell, and said “the telephone would never amount to anything”. It was only years later when the telephone took over telegram communication that Western Union tried to get in the game but were too late. Eventually, Western Union became a subsidiary of Bell’s own company. Bitcoin What about cryptocurrency? No one imagined Bitcoin would become so valuable. Think a thought for the poor bugger who mined 7,500 Bitcoins then unintentionally threw away his horde in 2013. Today his Bitcoins embedded in a hard disk are languishing somewhere in a dump and are worth over $80 million. Check out more interesting facts at the Betway Blog",1
"It is quite unprecedented to have Google/YouTube, Apple, Facebook and Pinterest wipe your site off their digital networks in a single day, all at the same time. This is what has happened to Infowars. This accolade must be given to stalwart preacher, Alex Jones, and his Infowars site which seems to have infuriated (triggered) the socialist controllers of the ruling tech conglomerates who define all internet media today. Jones is now a martyr and is claiming to be a free speech advocate, as is the normal behavioural response to such an all out purge. What does this say about the culture we now have on the internet? Well, conservative views, and Christianity are a dying old world view, and there is little or no toleration for any of these ideologies anymore amongst the major tech companies. Can you imagine all those man hours spent on making Infowars videos, and all those man hours spent ranting on about what is wrong with the world in their point of view, it’s all now gone, all thrown into the digital equivalent of Room 101. The Squib disagrees with censorship and its use for political means, however, we alone cannot fight this because these nefarious tech companies control everything now. You can’t squirt a few globules of piss these days without hitting a Marxist controlled tech company. The lines are clearly drawn, and the tech companies are now fully in line with Communist China, who are masters of censorship. You see, there may be conservative governments within the real physical world today, i.e. in the UK and US, but the internet has been completely hijacked by the communists. He who controls the media, controls the mind, as Mr Mojo Risin once said. Facebook and Google are now aligned with Chinese communistic censorship ideals. Twitter is utilising a Marxist academic, Rebekah Tromble, to control their platform. The deeply left CNN, and sites like Buzzfeed, which we endearingly call Spamfeed because of it spamming the net with utter low quality shit at high rates of speed, are now also aligned with China, and its censorious dialectic. The Squib does not subscribe to any political ideology however it recognises when political ideologies become apparent within certain forums, and the internet is now on the cusp of totalitarian socialist/communist rule. The American socialist Democrat party have now in their outrage over the Trump election, aligned themselves with China. What we have also interestingly observed is that hate speech is fine from the left, but not from the right. Not sure about the middle, but that’s another conversation. For example the recent appointing of South Korean anti-white activist, Sarah Jeong, who wants all white people to be killed. Seems strange, because there are many pale skinned South Koreans, but we know she meant the anglo-saxon type, so the New York Times hires her and nothing else is said. Domestic terrorists, Antifa are celebrated on all social media outlets and their calls to kill Trump supporters or white men are promoted across all platforms without any censorship. Double standards? Yes, of course, because the whole media is now controlled by people who actually despise themselves, and the America they live in. They want to change the country to subvert it and completely align it with certain totalitarian nations and the authoritarian communist ideology. The Squib has outlined many times that all points of view to any conversation should be heard, and if you are offended, then simply look away, but to be offended in a conversation is not a crime, this is part of human discourse, and what these tech companies are effectively doing is removing human conversation, so that only one sided propaganda can be apparent. No doubt, the remaining conversation is now one of only socialist values and indoctrination into the global communist hive mind. The American socialist Democrats are naturally also preparing for the 2020 elections as well as the 2018 midterm elections which will be held in November. By deleting one conservative voice, they are well on the way to eradicating all the others. Goodbye Infowars, you have effectively been neutered, your channel will now suffer a drastic fall in revenue/views, and of course you will continue to rant and rave on, but to a limited, conservative white Christian audience on your website. Are there ways of fighting back for Infowars? Yes, of course, but it will take money. Mr. Jones can start his own video streaming service, his own social network. These would of course be subject to no help from Google which controls 99% of the web. If Jones was to put his millions into building up his own network he may have a chance in the future. The other option is for the Trump government to punish these tech companies by making them pay the tax they truly deserve to pay. Christians have lost the battle on the internet, their religion is now effectively snuffed out, pilloried and violated. That’s the only positive, however, how ever much we detest organised man-made religions, we still feel that they have a right to speech, and we would defend that right with our lives. The socialist tech companies do not think that way. Remember, the Squib is just a mere observer, and a mirror of what is occurring at any time. We have no affiliation to any political party or ideology or race or huma-construct religion. This is one of the only videos available of Alex Jones on YouTube after the purge",1
"Social media is a relatively new phenomenon that has taken the global population by surprise and completely enslaved it in one fell swoop. Today, many people cannot be in a room on their own with their own thoughts for longer than one minute before they have to look at their social media accounts. Humans are now relative to drones in the hive mind, where they follow engineered thought patterns globally and are affected in concert by events and trend influencers. The goal of social media is to give people quick fixes, rewards, to enslave them in a box where their every thought is echoed, where their narcissism can truly take effect. By encapsulating humans within this simplistic form of communication, the social media companies are able to extract vast amounts of information to not only profit from, but to analyse human behaviour in multiple conditions. Social media has engineered a system where complex human behaviour is whittled to nothing more than a few words. This is the crux of the programming of humans to completely disable their true abilities and dumb them down to mere childish animal behaviour. The incessant chatter of social media also overtakes the human thought process, and people are now not able to think for themselves without going to social media. Their rational thought processes have been dimmed, or completely erased. There is little or no benefit to this, especially for children as they cannot progress as adult human beings, and for adults who use social media, they are reverting to childhood, with petty reward systems and the innate inability to form real social relationships face to face. Social media was designed to entrap, to subvert humans, and to damage society as a whole, and it is working very well. Selfies Amongst the megalomaniacs, narcissists, sociopaths, and the schizoids that now populate the world of social media, there is a terrible price being paid on humanity, as these people have been permanently altered, their brains now do not function without social media, they are now less tolerant, they are effective psychotics who delete humans in their social network with a blink of an eye, or a mouse click. What these social networks are engineering is a population of cold hearted killers, because if they can simply delete someone from their social network, what will stop them deleting people in real life? Nothing will stop them, as their minds have been trained and engineered to do so. Thus social media is creating a mass engineered swathe of nihilistic humans with no conscience or ability to empathise in a human manner. There is no given solution to the horror of social media, a prison of the mind where free thought is punished, and anyone who dissents from the indoctrinated hive mind is immediately set upon by mobs of social media thugs intent on hurt. We are now seeing this today, where the introduction of terms like ‘fake news’, and ‘hate speech’ are used as an Orwellian tool to subvert any form of free speech. All it takes is a group of internet thugs to report your account and your finished, there are no questions asked, and the mob is always right in the eyes of the algorithm. If you have children, keep them away from social media. Let them grow as human beings who can think rationally, logically and without the need for constant rewards. We must teach children logical thought processes and educate them in classical methods of thought, yet keep a modern slant on education in a scientific way, as well as culturally with high art. Anyone who uses social media today has been sadly infected to a point where it will be very hard to ever regain their rational selves, and souls back again. Such is the malaise that whole generations, and swathes of humans have now been lost. To destroy these people is now only too easy, all it would take is a switch off, and they would suddenly realise how lost they are. Switching everything off would culminate in a mass population psychotic event. Those who are awake will understand, however those who are hypnotised by social media are a lost cause, and should be deemed as completely useless human beings.",1

"T he foreign exchange market is appealing for many reasons: not only does it offer a seemingly endless variety of pairs, it also provides the chance to trade based on dynamic, fast-moving news from the worlds of politics, economics and more. With major currencies from time zones around the world available to be traded, the forex market is open for business pretty much all the time during the week – which makes it particularly appealing for those who are on flexible schedules. But it does come with its complications. There are some big technical complexities to get your head around before you can successfully trade the forex markets, and it’s also unpredictable. Here, then, are some ways to prepare yourself to enter the market and then get cracking with your first forex trade. What is foreign exchange? Before you even begin to look for a broker, it’s important to spend as much time as you need working out what the forex market is all about. There are many reasons why foreign currencies are bought and sold, and the main one with which most people are familiar is the exchange of currencies for tourist or business travel purposes when heading to a foreign country. But there are other possible reasons. Forex traders buy up currency for speculative reasons – which means they aim to sell it on at a higher price than the one they bought it for, thus making a profit. Others buy foreign currency to “hedge”, or to have an asset which protects them in case the market moves in a direction which harms their existing interests. Understanding the fundamentals Forex trading instruments differ in appearance and structure from most other offers on the investment market, which means that those who diversify their trading portfolio from stocks and shares or similar instruments often find forex a difficult beast at first. Currencies are, for example, always traded in pairs: if you want to trade the US dollar, say, you’ll have to speculate on its rise relative to another currency. Currencies are represented in three-letter codes, such as USD for the dollar, GBP for the British pound, and so on. The two currencies in question are separated by a slash, and the first currency in the pair is the one you’re hoping will rise. So, if you want to speculate that the US dollar will go up in value compared to the Japanese yen, for example, you’d need to invest in the USD/JPY pair. There’s much more to forex trading than that, though, and this explanation can only scratch the surface of the foreign exchange market. There are plenty of books and online resources which offer advice on Forex trading for Beginners, and reading these will give you a comprehensive understanding of how this complicated yet often lucrative market works and what it means for a trader. Find a calendar International economic calendars are absolutely essential tools which should be in the arsenal of every forex trader – perhaps more so than any other financial trading instrument. They come full of important information which traders will need to execute orders in an informed manner, so they’re vital. When a country’s central bank updates its monetary policy for example, the forex market can shift in minutes – and you need to ensure that you’re aware of when these developments are happening so that you can price the potential changes into your trading decision. Luckily, the calendars are relatively easy to find online – and they’re usually free. Choosing an instrument type In the modern trading world, it’s increasingly common for traders to choose contracts for difference – or CFDs – when trading foreign exchange. These instruments are derived from the underlying market, which means the trader doesn’t actually own the currency. However, they benefit – and lose out – from the same market fluctuations as the “real” currency, and they can usually also access the market much faster as CFD brokers are speedy and online-oriented. Forex CFDs can also offer higher profits (and losses) for lower initial deposits as they’re traded on margin – which essentially means the trader is borrowing the remainder of the required deposit from the broker whenever they open a position. Some traders (or clients of traders) prefer to purchase the actual currency itself, and this may be more appropriate if margin trading is not required. Working as a forex trader can be a tough gig, especially once the unpredictability and the complex fundamental principles are taken into account. And with other challenges like integration of accurate economic information into calendars to think about, forex trading can quickly become a hard job. That’s why information calendars, effective instrument type decisions and more should all be taken seriously. That way, the chances of your trading career getting off to the most successful and profitable start will be as high as possible.",1
"Sunseekers who religiously seek the prime spot of the beaches, and sun beds, are going to extraordinary lengths to make their summer holidays truly wondrous. Forget about German holidaymakers placing their towels on sun beds at 3am to get the best spots for the next day, a new trend is even more extreme. “These sunseekers storm the beach and get the sun beds before anyone can even bat an eyelid. It’s like the storming of Normandy beach, except in Spain,” one angry tourist said who had to sit on a rock after the prime beach areas were taken. The alarming trend is now a frequent occurrence across the whole of Spain’s coast. Miguel Conquistador, 49, from Alicante, was shocked when he was about to place his beach towel on the sand in a prime spot from the sea when he was affected by the phenomenon. “I was just about to place my towel on the sand, when suddenly out of the sea a group of sunseekers suddenly landed their boat and rushed towards me. In a matter of seconds, my towel had been kicked away and 67 people were sitting in my spot.” These sudden landings by sunseekers is actually great news for Spain, and should be encouraged to the full. Not migrants “These are sunseekers on their summer holidays, and not migrants. It’s a beautiful sight to see people who are dedicated to the beach life taking so much care and attention to their summer holidays. We invite them to Spain, please come, enjoy our beaches, our wine, our women. You are all welcome,” Spain’s Interior Minister, Rodriguez Schengenado, told Spanish news networks on Tuesday.",1
"In the words of a great rock band, Kiss, who were mainly Jewish, ‘Everybody’s gotta reason to live’, something, maybe Jeremy Corbyn does not believe to be true. The right to life, to self determination, is a hard fought right, and certainly the state of Israel has fought tooth and nail to survive for so long. History is about conquest, and the Jewish state has as much right to exist as any other state in the world. With regards to anyone criticising Israel as being deemed as anti-semitic, this is another hard paradoxical line in the sand that Jeremy Corbyn has brought to the fore. In rational discussion, it may be okay to criticise a state’s specific actions, however one should not criticise the state’s reason to exist. All Jewish people have a right to exist as much as any other, and this is the crux of the problem for Corbyn, because he is siding with the likes of Hamas, who do not believe that Israel has a right to exist and all Jews should just keel over and die. That stance, is anti-semitic and Corbyn knows it full well. No one should ever forget the holocaust and all the other atrocities meted out on Jews throughout history, and for this, it is their right to fight anti-semitism at every turn. Today, atrocities are committed by all global factions, and indeed Israel has come down hard on those who sought to attack their state, and in desperation, the Palestinians have committed many atrocities fighting those who they blame for their misfortune. One must again look at history, invention, ingenuity, technique always wins through, and the Jews have always been at the forefront of all of these points. The Palestinians never broke through, they never innovated, they never chose the path of ingenuity or technical excellence. Jeremy Corbyn, is now walking a very dangerous tightrope from which he has possibly tainted the whole Labour party for many years to come. Alienating a very important population strand in Britain and indeed the world, it is only a matter of time before something gives and he loses his grip on the party completely. Does Jeremy Corbyn have the right to exist?",1
"There’s something about McDonalds which brings forth the beast in the great unwashed masses. Not only does the fast food restaurant feed the people with their daily mush, it is a conduit for extreme violence, most of the time highly entertaining gladiatorial combat that ends up on YouTube. Over the years the restaurant has tried to clean up its image, and has refurbished their restaurants to try to appeal to a better clientele, however this has mostly failed because the food they serve only applies itself to the lowest common denominator. Processed shit for the Untermensch is a big money maker, and there will never be any escape for the company in this respect. The only solution obviously is to put armed guards in every restaurant outlet. This way, when the ratchets start their screeching and hair pulling, and the gang boys start their fist fights, there could be a lot of tomato ketchup splattered all over the walls as the armed guards let loose. McDonalds employees beating customers with their fists, although entertaining, is less effective than guns. Amongst the wreckage, the discarded hair weaves, the ripped thongs, the McDonalds sign shines down from above, an unholy reminder that in satan’s kitchen, money is made despite the brutal violence. Business carries on as they mop up the shit and the blood from the floor and walls. Cha ching!",1
"The shameful British have forgotten how to rule themselves, they have been slaves for so long to Brussels. Theresa May, the current PM, is an insipid scrawny grey pustule who could not make a deal with a paper bag let alone a coterie of unelected officials from the EU. Watching the inspiring speech by Trump on Thursday regarding the reintroduction of manufacturing of steel back into the USA was a momentous moment for many workers who have been bypassed by the likes of Obama who favoured communist China over American workers. Trump, much to the chagrin of the American socialists is actually making a difference to many peoples’ lives. Trump’s earlier meeting with Juncker sealed further trade concessions from the EU, in just a few hours of talks. Something the timid, listless British cannot do as they cower in the corner scared to even utter a word to their EU masters. Britain indeed is a country enslaved for so long it has a case of Stockholm Syndrome. If the British had an ounce of the balls that Trump has we would have been out of the EU prison a long time ago, instead Britain kowtows to every Brussels demand and is left in a shameful imbroglio, as the likes of Michel Barnier tighten their octopus grip over the imprisoned country. Britain, infected by the treachery of Remoaners, people who actively seek to do harm to the country by sabotaging every attempt to leave the EU protectionist racket, and its totalitarian Sovietized ideology are a testament that there are many Marxists within the British Isles. One day hopefully they will be rooted out and made to pay for their crimes. Can’t we hire Trump for at least one hour to go at it at the EU? He would no doubt stride into the meeting, slap something on the table, then say take it or leave it. The EU would capitulate or be thrown into total disarray. This is how Trump would negotiate with the EU, who are using Britain’s cowardice and negativity to great effect. Apart from a few Brexiteers in parliament, no one has any balls anymore. Even the grandchild of Churchill, the bloated cochon Soames has been paid off by the EU and would sell off Britain at the drop of a hat. How ironic that Soames is now a Haw Haw. Winston Churchill most certainly did not give him any balls down the line, as he waddles around the Commons floor like a fat cheap whore on the take. That spinning sound you hear when Soames speaks is the sound of his grandfather in his grave. Winston Churchill’s vision of the EU was one led by Britain and France, and not Germany, and this is the crux of the matter. Whilst Britain was a member of the EU it had no say, and no power. If no one steps up soon to delete Theresa May, and her Remoaners, all will be lost. All hope, all chance of freedom, all national pride, but it seems that Britain had little or no national pride anyway. Please Mr. Trump come and save Britain, as the Americans saved Britain in World War II.",1
"What could you do with more than $125 billion? A lot, you say. Well, $125 billion just disappeared off Facebook’s value in a few minutes after its QE2 earnings came through and a new censorship drive was pushed through. Much of the loss for these FANG stocks will be the precursor for more falls as time goes by, because investors have been hit hard with the fall. No one with a brain or a wallet wants to touch these stocks, simply because of the climate we are in now. On the bright side, at least Zuckerberg burned a new U.S record. The one day drop of Facebook was the highest stock market single day loss in known American history. Socialists are meant to be inclusive This climate is an Orwellian deluge of mass censorship, mass deletions, and un-inclusivity. What the socialists who run these tech media companies do not realise is that they are censoring the spice that made their boring formats exciting. Anyone with an education and logical thought process can see if a post is rather iffy or outrageous, but they watch the videos for entertainment purposes. There is no need to censor something purely because it does not conform to socialist political ideals. There has been mass censorship of all conservative views on these platforms, there has also been shadow-banning, and mass deletions of accounts that did not conform to the communistic views of the controllers in charge. What we have now is a completely one-sided platform on places like YouTube and Facebook, where anything with an alternative view is labelled as ‘hate speech’ then removed. Orwellian Thoughtcrime Defining ‘hate speech’ is a difficult proposal, but much can be plonked into its allocation folder. Much like George Orwell’s 1984, we are seeing anything that does not hold the American democratic socialist party’s line of thought as ‘hate speech’. By removing the essence of discussion, of opposing views, you see a decline in conversation, a fall in debate, and thus these platforms are now merely propaganda machines for the American socialists to feed off each other as everyone else is excluded from the debate. To question something is now deemed as ‘hate crime’ because the questioning goes against the narrative or socialist conditioning that is constantly put out by the tech companies and the socialist controlled media. Censorship kills discussion, censorship kills art, and censorship kills the fundamental reason why the internet, world wide web was created. Berners-Lee surely would agree? Censoring formerly protected genres Google has even severely censored the Daily Squib, which is an essentially satirical parody news format, and in history satire/parody has only been heavily censored by totalitarian communist and fascist regimes. We can therefore surmise, that this time we are living in is one of a totalitarian regime, where even the supposedly protected genre of satire is attacked. Our YouTube channel which we stopped using, was shadow-banned years ago. There is no point in posting a video on the channel because it will not get any views anymore. We tested this by uploading one of our videos onto a new created account with a different name and it immediately received tens of thousands of views. The original video in our official account got 120 views over five years. This is the level of censorship we are dealing with, where creativity, innovation and alternative views are crushed to leave a bland landscape of ‘yes men’, a hive like culture where everyone says the same thing and thinks in the same way. Humanity never progressed much when everyone said the same thing, and everyone agreed. Fuck that! What these tech companies are essentially doing is aligning themselves with communist China and its censorship technique. Facebook is itching to get into the Chinese market, therefore they are aligning themselves with the same communist ideals as the Chinese. One can only hope that the censors bring these FANG stocks, and the rest of the fucking NASDAQ down by another 40-60%. Let us see how your censorship works then you socialist ‘inclusive’ controllers of all media.",1
"With 39 signatures already lodged by backbenchers to dump Theresa May in a vote of no confidence, May’s act of sheer stupidity and arrogance is of stripping the Brexit department of any responsibility in EU negotiations and appointing Remainer, lickspittle Olly Robbins in charge of everything. The PM cannot be trusted, as she has been proven to be a liar and deceitful snake by trying to push through the Olly Robbins penned Chequers Brino proposal. Corruption The announcement was sneaked in just minutes before Mr Raab and Mr Robbins were due to give evidence to the Commons Brexit committee and appeared to be a major snub to the new Brexit secretary who is only in his second week of the job. This move by Theresa May in effect makes Raab into a mere ‘yes man’ as he has no powers whatsoever, and will answer chiefly to Robbins. The DS is under a BREXIT war footing at the moment and will continue to urge the deliverance of Britain from this treasonous hijacking of Brexit by Remainers and the duplicitous lying Mrs May. Theresa May has to go! Any method will do, either under a bus, or the 1922 committee will suffice. If the Tories do not unseat Theresa May soon, many Conservative MPs in marginal seats will be unseated for a very long time as no one will vote for them ever again. Enjoy your holiday you lying old goat, because when you come back you won’t be PM any more.",1
"Berkeley College activist students were up in arms on Monday demanding that the French language only caters for two genders and should include other genders in its grammatical noun system. Berkeley gender activists are boycotting all French products and French lessons until the French rewrite their language to include multiple gender types and sexualities as well as transgender types, that fall under the Californian Gender Codex enshrined in state law in 2010 and honoured by Barack Obama himself. French Masculine and Feminine Every French noun is either masculine or feminine, and this affects how the noun is treated. One more or less has to memorise the gender of each noun, although you can often tell whether a word is masculine or feminine by looking at its ending. Masculine nouns often have the ending: aire. In French the pronouns (Le, La, Les) will depend on the gender of the noun in question. All the nouns are masculine or feminine. For masculine nouns “The” is Le, whilst for feminine nouns “The” is La. If the noun is plural then “The” becomes Les. For example : The pig = Le cochon The whore = La putain The dogs = Les chiens French Language Gender Dispute The French gender issue arose when one activist took a semester of linguistics and was shocked how the French language only catered for masculine and feminine nouns. Donny Fargotte, 23, a student activist was outraged by the exclusion of transexual nouns and verbs in the French language and its exclusivity to masculine and feminine. “This is gender fascism. We detest masculine, the word masculine itself is an attack on every gender status and should be outlawed, but to have a language that only has masculine and feminine descriptions of nouns is disgusting. I stood up in my class and shouted. I cried and cried for three days at this outrageous exclusion of all other genders. This is why we have a big problem. We are going to petition the French government to change their language.” Some of the suggestions proposed by the activists is to change (Le, La, Les) to (Ze, Zee, Zees) and that all references to masculine and feminine grammar be erased completely. On Tuesday, a Boycott French day will be held at the campus, and next week, a visiting professor from a French university will probably be met with riots.",1
"In today’s internet era, there are too many voices, and everyone now has an opinion. The populace are now unmanageable. In days past, everyone knew their place, and everyone stayed in their place, but today this is not the case, and for the elite this is a sure sign that the end will be messy and troublesome. The wealthy have already abandoned all hope of a future where the populace, formerly known as plebs, have a voice, and have a modicum of power. They are therefore preparing for either an engineered form of deconstruction or a sudden chaotic unravelling. They are already preparing for a post-consumerist future society ruled by scientific technocrats serviced by technological automation. The elite and wealthy have already exhausted the consumerist society and used consumers to become billionaires, however they know that this state of affairs cannot last. Most certainly, the event will be an economic eviscerating maelstrom that will lead into anarchic catastrophe with gangs roaming, mass looting, and cataclysmic death to many who are unprepared. You see, the wealthy, the elite, are prepared, they have already secured plots of land with shelters, some underground, some in very secluded spots, but these wealthy elite still have one problem, how to keep their security and manual workers loyal to them when the event happens. It will be all too easy for the security detail to band together and take over the wealthy in their luxurious bunkers. What do you do when paper money is worthless, and your security men surround you with the guns you gave them? How does one keep the loyalty of the servants during a cataclysmic event wiping out all of society economically? There are certainly no easy solutions to such a debacle, but the only real solution is for these billionaires who have never done anything with their hands, or had a manual job, to actually hold a gun themselves. Many will not be able to and will perish. The first thing that happens in a major economic disaster is that all the rich in every neighbourhood are quickly dispatched and their homes/businesses looted. The swarmiing poor are vast in numbers, and when there is no police to protect the wealthy, the rich are the first to go. When that source is depleted, the people turn on themselves. Of course there are alternatives, but the technology for robots and automated guards controlled by sophisticated AI is still in its infancy. It will take another thirty to forty years to replicate humans in their entirety, but even then there will be major flaws. The time line for such an event nears every day, simply because the populace are getting more and more uncontrollable every day. The economic system built on debt, is not built on a firm foundation, and sooner or later it will give away. The Illusion will be lost overnight, the illusion of democracy, the illusion of economic prosperity, and furthermore, the interlinked global economy will crumble in one fell swoop, purely because there are little or no ways to quarantine contagion. Already, there are brief murmurs of such an event occurring, and you will know when it happens because you will not see any police in the streets any more, no medics, no social services, and there will be no way of getting your money out of the banks. All mobile phones will cease working in an instant, as well as electricity grids, and water processing centres. In effect, there will be silence. This silence will be the starting bell for carnage, anarchy and total chaos to reign over the crumbling old system, which will be cleansed over many years of nihilistic purges. Even though this warning was written in full sight, many will not heed it, and they will carry on with their meaningless lives as slaves to their mortgages and tax slave jobs. What do people do when there is no more food in the shops, when paper money is useless, and there is no authority? The answer is they do anything to survive. Anything. ",1
"From left to right: Vlad Putinski, Valdimir Putana, Vladimirski Putinov, Vladimirov Putinoff, Vladi Puttitov Police have identified on CCTV cameras the suspected perpetrators of the Novichok attack on Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and other poisoning victims. Officers think several Russians were involved in the attempted murder of the former double agent and daughter Yulia in Salisbury and are looking for more than one suspect. A source with knowledge of the investigation said: “The team of Russians have been identified and we have released their names after we found out who they were. We urge the public to be very cautious if they meet one of these men, do not accept any drinks from them or perfume bottles.” The suspects have been named as Vlad Putinski, Valdimir Putana, Vladimirski Putinov, Vladimirov Putinoff, and finally Vladi Puttitov. These men were last seen walking down Salisbury High Street, close to where the poisonings from nerve agent Novichok was discovered. Do not approach these Russians if you come into contact with them, either run in the other direction or call the police immediately. They are very dangerous and have copious amounts of Novichok on their person at all times.",1
"Putin puts the twist on Trump a la Stir Crazy There is a very good reason that Donald Trump’s visit to Helsinki saw the U.S. president cowering like a little poodle when the Grandmaster chess genius, Vladimir Putin turned up. The Russians have key Kompromat documentation and photographic, video evidence about Trump’s past visits to Russia and what he got up to. Allegedly, the Russians have extensive footage of Trump’s visit in 2013 with numerous prostitutes urinating on a hotel bed where Obama once slept, then indulging in ‘golden showers’. Igor Federov, an observer revealed the ins and outs of the situation. “One can see the fear in Trump’s eyes as he cowers before his master. All it would take is one wave of the hand, and Trump would not only be completely disgraced, but he would no doubt be impeached and thrown to the dogs. Trump agreed to every word that Putin said denying all knowledge of U.S. electoral tampering, and in the light of the recent Novichok poisonings in the UK, he did not even mention that either. This is a classic case of Kompromat.” One Associated Press reporter, Jonathan Lemire, seeing how the president sheepishly cowered in Putin’s presence, even dared to ask Putin whether the Russians had any compromising material on Trump. Putin of course masterly denied the fact, although Trump practically sank into the podium. The Steele dossier commissioned by lawyers working for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign can be read in full here. ",1
"Britain has been at war for some time. We are now in a Brexit war, where Britain will either sink or swim. This war is both internal and external. The concept of leaving the EU completely i.e. Brexit, is actually a very simple notion that has been muddied by Remoaners in Parliament, and the EU, who have sought to stifle every part of the process of Brexit. What Brexit initially means, and what the people voted for on June 23, 2016, is for Britain to leave the EU single market, to leave EU laws and law courts, and to leave the EU Customs Union. This can all be achieved by applying WTO rules to trade and completely cutting ties with the EU courts and laws. In effect, on Brexit, no EU law would be valid in a UK court. The myriad of EU laws that have already been incorporated into the UK would have to all eventually be looked at and amended, but this is not a matter of grave urgency as other parts of Brexit will be. Regarding the EU red herring of the Irish border, this is inconsequential. It is a matter for the EU what they do with their EU customs. It has nothing to do with Britain at all, and the UK should simply leave the EU to ponder on it. Imports and exports to the EU and world will also continue under WTO rules, and the regulatory minefield that the EU creates for everything is their problem. Many products do not actually need tariffs, so it is a question of dealing with those that do. The UK just has to acknowledge that the EU has tonnes of regulations for everything, and that is that. Let the EU over regulate and indulge in useless bureaucracy and inhibitive protectionism, where the UK will not stifle business any more. Passporting rights for City workers is also another contentious issue. This can be solved very easily by ignoring the whole issue. Most UK firms do not actually need passporting rights. London will always be the centre of the financial world simply because of its location, and its time zone. Trade deals and immigration are of course a foremost subject to include. All it would take is a team of dedicated people six months to establish new trade deals, and to take back complete control of Britain’s borders by implementing a funnelling system with regards to EU migration unless applicants have high paying jobs and means to support themselves. There would naturally have to be new migration policies written to accommodate the new rules. America and Australia are begging the UK for new trade deals, as well as the lucrative South East Asian markets. Migration is good for the UK, and the economy, however we must implement a more controlled approach as opposed to unfettered. As for the millions of EU migrants who have come to Britain and are utilising our benefits system, and are not employed or employable. They will be given a cut off period of three months to find a job or be sent back to the EU. There have also been many instances of Third World citizens buying EU citizenship from Malta. These people will all be removed forthwith and sent back to their respective countries. The UK has also been blighted by thousands of EU criminals, who when caught and imprisoned are a large taxpayer burden. Because of EU courts, these criminals were not able to be sent back to the EU. After Brexit, all EU criminals within Britain’s prison system will be returned to the EU immediately. British citizens living in the EU will have their futures on the line because the EU is a vindictive nasty player and will not afford them any clemency. They therefore have two choices, stay in their respective EU territory and apply for citizenship, or come back to the UK. It would also serve Britain to increase the number of migration centres for the numbers of people who will be processed and sent back will be many. As for the CAP, tied in with Brussels, this would all be scrapped immediately. Farming subsidies will revert to the UK government. All inhibitive EU regulations would be scrapped immediately. All fishing rights within British sea channels would be for use only by British fishermen. This would be enforced by the Royal Navy who would get extra funding and ships to patrol the fishing areas. Any illegal fishermen from the Continent would be first warned, and if they refuse, they would be arrested. All payments to Brussels will cease immediately. Britain should also not have to pay a ransom amount of £45 billion stipulated by the EU, and will refuse all payments. The EU may pursue this in their courts but this would take many years, and Britain should carry on refusing payment indefinitely. The UK government could reciprocate on any EU punishments doled out in vindictive anger by enticing worldwide corporate businesses to the UK shores with lower taxation rates, and other incentives, effectively undercutting the EU. This would make the UK into a magnet for corporations and increase business activity and entrepreneurship tenfold making the UK into a global hub of International business. As for Remoaners; who have sided with the enemy, have taken illicit payments from the EU, have constantly talked Britain down and betrayed its people, they should be tried in the courts. There is no doubt that many Remoaners in parliament are receiving large sums of money from the enemy, including the meddler George Soros, the Open Society financier, to thwart Britain’s run for Brexit freedom and International trading success. From this point we must take a military stance to proceedings as there will be many loose ends that need to be tied. The process of Brexit, if looked upon in a military fashion is very simple, and it should be treated clinically as if we are in a time of war. This war, will take a lot of patience, dedication and sheer will to win, but it is winnable, Brexit can be achieved very easily be simply removing the factors that step in its way. Once a problem factor is identified, it must be targeted, then removed, so we can move on. Brexit can be achieved quickly and effectively, but there will have to be ruthless decisions made with clinical precision and technique. ",1
"This is not an ultimatum to the Conservative government and Theresa May, but a hard truth. Theresa May blatantly lied not only to her own ministers misleading them, but she lied to voters and the public ever since she shoehorned her way into unelected office. Theresa May could also have committed High Treason against the Sovereign. There is no doubt that May is a liar and cannot be trusted. She is not capable of negotiation and is incompetent as well as dishonest. Every day she stays as prime minister is another day the Conservative party will be out of office, unelectable and irrelevant. The Conservatives thus have two choices: dump May and survive or keep her and go under for the next thirty odd years. Already, thousands of Tories are abandoning the party but it will get a lot worse. Theresa May must go, and we must have a real Brexiteer in charge, not a Brixiteer in Name Only like the scallywags who backed May’s Chequers BRINO White Paper proposal. The choice is yours Tories, either boot the witch or stay out of government for a very, very long time.",1
"Few people will have expected Donald Trump to conform to all protocols during his first official visit to Britain – but he nevertheless raised eyebrows when he twice broke with etiquette within minutes of meeting the Queen at Windsor Castle. The US president was condemned on social media for walking in front of the Queen as they inspected a guard of honour of the Coldstream Guards. She was left having to decide which side of him to go as she caught up to walk alongside him. Royal piggyback Then during a photo call, the president jumped unannounced up onto the Queen’s shoulders and started waving at the assembled press and Coldstream Guards making funny faces. The Queen kept her regal poise throughout the president’s antics, and shouldered the heavy burden quite remarkably for a woman in her nineties. Melania Trump, just ignored the whole event completely. “The Queen showed extreme strength and poise throughout the whole Trump event. Wow, she is so strong she did not even flinch once.” one Twitter user commented. A royal family spokesperson said the Queen piggyback was completely off royal protocol but because it was performed by the American president, it was laughed off afterwards as a show of American greeting. The monarchy’s official guidance online says there are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or a member of the royal family, but many people wish to observe traditional forms. “For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way,” the royal website says. Piggybacks are a complete no no, when it comes to royal protocol.",1

"High ranking EU Kommandant Martin Selmayr giggled with glee at the end of England’s World Cup dreams and posted pro-EU propaganda to celebrate on Twitter, it has been reported. Kommandant Selmayr, whose grandfather was lieutenant-colonel Josef Selmayr, a convicted war criminal – later pardoned – who served in the Balkans fighting for Hitler in WW2, has no love for the English. “Every time the Kommandant hears the name of an English person, or England, his face goes sour, I once saw him spit into his wastepaper bin when someone mentioned ‘Windsor Castle’. The Kommandant is very particular about the EU ruining Britain, he always says that even though Germany lost the war in 1945, we won in the end with the EU. He is of course correct 100%, because it is now the UK that takes orders from the EU, and who rules the EU? Yes, you guessed it — Germany!” Kommandant Selmayr was recently promoted to his post by Jean Claude Juncker, whose father was a prominent Nazi fighting on the Russian front in WW2 as well. Juncker’s father-in-law, Louis Mathias Frising — dad to Juncker’s wife of 35 years Christiane — was a teacher in Ettelbruck, Luxembourg, when the Germans invaded in 1940. Frising volunteered to be a Nazi propaganda chief while banning spoken French in favour of German. He was also responsible for enforcing a law which stripped Jews of their rights and professions — the first stage of the Holocaust. “So, as you can see you Englischer swine, the hierarchy of the EU is currently run by people who have a Nazi lineage. It is quite fitting, is it not?” a former EU Commission employee revealed. If Hitler were alive today, he would be proud of the EU.",1
"RAF Spitfire coming into land Yesterday, 10 July 2018 was the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force, and there was a celebration of the brave men and women who contributed to the air force with their courage and many with their lives. We must also not forget the many who fought alongside the RAF, especially in World War II, the USAAF/USAF who bolstered the RAF from 1942 onwards in winning the war against Germany with many daring raids into enemy territory. The RAF during the Battle of Britain saved these shores from the Luftwaffe, with ultimate bravery and skill. RAF Bravery Pilots like Flight Lieutenant James Nicolson who was on patrol near Southampton on 16 August 1940, when his Hawker Hurricane was fired on by a German fighter aircraft. Making the ‘loudest noises [he] had ever heard’, four cannon shells thudded into his cockpit, damaging his machine, setting his petrol tank alight and wounding him in the eye, leg and heel. Surrounded by flames and with blood pouring down him from his injuries, Nicolson prepared to bail out. But just as he did so, he spotted a Messerschmitt Bf 110 ahead. Despite being in severe pain, he put down his parachute and reached instead for his gun controls. He poured fire into the German aircraft, keeping up his assault even as it tried to turn and twist away from him. As he attacked, Nicolson noticed that the intense heat of the cockpit was burning his flesh. Only then did he abandon his Hurricane. After giving the Messerschmitt one last burst, he struggled free of his blazing cockpit and tumbled out into the sky. Nicolson deployed his parachute and, as he fell, he took stock of his extensive injuries, noticing that he could see the bones of his left hand showing through the knuckles. He managed to land in a field and was rushed to hospital, where his life hung in the balance. After several weeks, he had recovered enough to make it out of danger, but the burns he had received took much longer to heal.

"Philippe Pétain, Vichy Government, France, WW2 The President of the United States, Donald Trump will fly into London following a Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday afternoon. His itinerary involves him travelling straight to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, where Theresa May is supposed to host Mr Trump and his wife Melania for a black-tie dinner with 100 guests and ministers. The question is, after the Chequers fiasco, where Theresa May revealed her Brexit In Name Only plan, will the president want to meet Theresa May? The US Ambassador Woody Johnson, has already voiced his opinion on Theresa May’s BRINO plan, and has questioned whether any future bilateral US trade deals would be possible after the complete Chequers capitulation to the EU by May and her Remainer Cabinet. Donald Trump, who is conducting a trade war with the EU, will not be happy by Theresa May’s complete betrayal of 17.4 million voters who voted for a Brexit on June 23, 2016. “My guess is, Mr. Trump will attend the dinner, however, he will not be able to look in the quisling Theresa May’s eyes, out of shame for her, and how she betrayed her own country just to stay in office. He will speak a few words to her, but nothing important, and ignore the witch for the rest of the evening and the next day,” a senior Trump aide revealed. President Donald Trump will visit on the Friday, a defence installation where he will try to bolster NATO further by trying to persuade May to increase UK military spending, which will most probably be like trying to get blood out of a stone. Theresa May is not interested in Britain’s defence as she is Remainer and believes Britain should erradicate its armed forces so that the EU can save it during a time of war. Under her insipid reign, the armed forces have seen their military budget cut to a pittance, rendering it a useless fighting force if there ever were a conflict. On the same day, after the military discussion, Trump will be ferried off to Chequers, a scene of a grave crime against Britain. There, Theresa May will hope to discuss trade deals with the president, but it is not certain he will want to discuss them with May. Then after a non-working-lunch, it’s off to meet the Queen at Windsor Castle where Trump will amuse her Majesty with some of his American charm. The Donald, will then hang out in his golf courses in Scotland until he leaves on Sunday back to the US. Luckily for the president, he will go nowhere near Central London where a crowd of socialists and communists are planning a rally replete with a London Mayor approved blow-up doll of Trump fashioned as a big baby. The London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, instead of fighting rampant knife crime and murder in the Capital, is instead putting all of his effort into not only denigrating his own office with puerile anti-Trump shows but putting a big stain on the whole of the UK by agreeing to this pathetic socialist protest against a very important ally, and saviour of Britain in two World Wars.",1
"We would like to extend our gratitude and utmost respect to those who fell in the line of BRINO fire, those who chose to sacrifice their own positions in the duplicitous lying Remainer-led Cabinet of Theresa May, those who stood up for their country and its principals as a Sovereign nation whilst others treacherously undermined it and tried to sell a disguised Brexit proposal to the masses and Ministers, when in fact it was a Brexit In Name Only. Theresa May, led the people and parliament on for two years proclaiming that she would take Britain out of the Single Market, out of the Customs Union, and secure the borders. Then on Friday, 6 July, she presented a completely new plan that would tie the UK to the EU indefinitely with no way of getting out, and would also make it nigh on impossible to conduct trade deals with our allies like the United States. The US Ambassador, Woody Johnson, was not the only one shocked by the Theresa May Brexit betrayal and has now stated that it is highly unlikely a bilateral trade deal between the US and UK can take place after the Chequers BRINO plan was revealed. Theresa May also alienated and ignored all Brexiteers in and out of the Cabinet, she surrounded herself and instated Remainers in high positions like the Treasury, where they thwarted any chance of a real Brexit. Philip Hammond, the Remainer Chancellor of the Exchequer, was a key player in thwarting Brexit. The Theresa May Chequers plan will involve the permanent continuation in the UK of all EU laws which relate to goods, their composition, their packaging, how they are tested etc etc in order to enable goods to cross the UK/EU border without controls. All goods on the UK manufactured in the UK for the UK domestic market, or imported from non-EU countries, would be permanently subject to these controls. Under Theresa May’s plan the UK would have to alter these laws in future whenever the EU alters its own laws. This would put the EU in a position to fashion its rules relating to goods so as to further the interests of continental producers against UK competitors, when we will have no right to vote on those rules. The obligation to follow the EU rulebook for goods would gravely impair the UK’s ability to conduct an independent trade policy. In particular, it will prevent the UK from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for goods in trade treaties and this is likely to destroy the prospect of successfully achieving meaningful agreements with some of the prime candidates such as the USA and Australia. The Theresa May Remainer Chequers plan therefore leads directly to a worst-of-all-worlds “Black Hole” Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tarpit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty vetos rights as an EU Member State. Not only that, for this bogus turd of a proposal, the UK will have to pay the EU £40 Billion taxpayers money. How is that for a complete capitulation and kick in the bollocks? Now we have an effective Theresa May Vichy government made up solely of Remainers and Brexiteer-turncoats trying to push through a plan that will enslave Britain forever under EU rules and regulations.

"It takes a special type of person to look you in the eye and sell you something that is flawed, wrong and extremely dangerous. Introducing Theresa May’s pick for BRINO Secretary, Dominic Scab, because essentially he is a scab, and even though he campaigned for Leave, he knows what he is doing now is just going through the motions, selling out Britain for the lowest price. Any former Leaver who now takes the job of BRINO Secretary has no fucking soul, or guts, and is a coward, only in it for the bribes. “This guy, Scab, will make no difference. We must remember that Theresa May only answers to Brussels and Olly Robbins now, the treasonous Remainer locust who has weaselled his way into the PM’s close circle,” one MP quipped from the halls of Westminster. Nevertheless, we shall see from the oncoming days how events unfold with the BRINO and all the Remainers who took over and killed off Brexit.",1
"Located on planet Brino, Boris, once a good Jedi, has been seduced by the dark side of the Force, but all is not lost, he can return to the good Force if he makes that step. Whatever they promised you Boris, do not take it. Do not take their bribes, and their false promises, and their lies. Do not listen to the Sith Snake, Gove, remember that knife in your back is still lodged firmly from the last time. They are liars, as they have lied to the British people, and the 17.4 million who voted to get out of the EUMPIRE. You yourself called the Chequers BRINO plot a ‘turd’ and many agree with you. Listen, you may think it is better to be in the Cabinet then out, however you can still come into the light old chap, all it takes is one step at a time. The Dark Force can be enticing, it allures you into its depths with glamour, but look beyond the curtain and you will see that it is FALSE glamour. All that glitters is not gold Boris, just look for yourself. Come forth into the light and you will free yourself from the clutches of the Dark Side. The Path of Light is less glamorous but it is a true path. The Path of Light is also harder to navigate but it is the righteous path, and not one of falsities, lies and shame. You can do it Boris. We know you can. All it takes is one step forward, then another, then another.. Believe in the Force Boris. Do not be seduced by the Dark Force, look into the light instead!",1
"Well done to David Davis who had the courage to put his country before his job last night by resigning, however, because of the Conservative anger towards the BRINO Chequers White Paper, Theresa May is now falling on Labour to push her sell-out Brexit In Name Only plan. Theresa May’s deputy, arch Remainers, David Lidington, and Gavin Barwell will be meeting with the opposition Labour party MPs at 11am to ask them to vote for the Chequers BRINO deal that has caused many Conservatives to abstain. “Theresa May is now working with the socialists as she has completely alienated Tory grassroots voters and fellow MPs. She is now working with Labour to put through a plan that will shackle the UK to the EU indefinitely with no chance of ever getting out,” one Tory MP revealed on condition of anonymity. The only chance now for the country is for the correct amount of signatures delivered to the 1922 Committee and a vote of no confidence placed on Theresa May’s desk. Will the Tories save face after the Cabinet BRINO betrayal? Will Boris Johnson come in from the dark side, and forget the bribes and career promises? If there is a chink of light in the darkness, please let it shine on BoJo to put the final nail in the coffin of Theresa May’s barren plan. You can redeem yourself Boris. ",1
"Amongst the cynical ploy of putting forward a soft Brexit plan when England played and won against Sweden in the World Cup, to somehow put an analgesic effect on the announcement that the Tory Cabinet had accepted a complete capitulation to Brussels with a soft Brexit, there is now a serious threat that no one who voted for Brexit will ever vote for the Conservatives again. Already, the polls suggest a breakthrough for Labour as they shoot upwards at 40% leaving the Tories trailing at 38%. Labour Party now polling 5% ahead of Conservatives. Public Say Theresa May Should Resign 49 to 38% This terrible betrayal by the Number10 Cabinet will no doubt precipitate in total election wipeouts in the future as people never forget the blatant betrayal put upon them by Theresa May. If the Conservatives have anything left in their feeble scrotums, they will call the 1922 Committee to rid the party of Theresa May, however that is a long shot as the party is now so left-wing that there is barely any distinction between Labour. As stated before, the Tories should expect a long stay in the political wilderness as an opposition party if they dared to even mention the Soft Brexit words, let alone try to implement it with a White paper. There is no further recourse now but to wish that justice prevails, and the blatant betrayal is thwarted, and that fucking quisling Michael Gove as well as the others lose their seats for their treachery. It is quite fitting that Michael Gove, who has aspirations of leadership in the party, has effectively cut himself short by his treacherous actions by putting his career ahead of his country. Good riddance to bad rubbish.",1
"Lying Prime Minister, Theresa May, who has gone back on her words in the Conservative Manifesto to take Britain out of the EU, consulted with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French negotiator Michel Barnier on the 5th July who dictated to May how the BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) White Paper should be constructed, before presenting it to the Cabinet at Chequers on July 6, 2018. The White Paper plan effectively ties the UK to EU laws and regulations indefinitely thus rendering a promised Brexit null and void. The plan was also most probably seen and given final approval by Donald Tusk, and Jean Claude Juncker. The duplicitous PM then presented the document to her Cabinet who agreed on its contents even though the White Paper gave away much of Britain’s sovereignty and freedoms. Theresa May threatened anyone who disagreed with the betrayal of British voters with the sack and bolstered many of the Cabinet members who were previously Brexiteers their aspirations for party leadership as a bribe. High Treason High treason is the crime of disloyalty to the Crown. By giving away Britain’s sovereignty to foreign powers; and plotting in consort with foreign powers against the sovereign status of the United Kingdom and adhering to the sovereign’s enemies, giving them aid or comfort; and attempting to undermine the lawfully established sovereignty of the land, Theresa May has wilfully acted against the Sovereign and committed High treason. Theresa May’s treachery does not stop there however, in the days to come, we will see further outcomes to how she sold off Britain’s sovereignty by simply renaming EU laws and incorporating them as UK laws so that Britain stays in the Single Market and the EU Customs Union effectively shackling the country with the EU indefinitely. After giving away Britain’s sovereignty indefinitely to the EU, and perverting Britain’s democracy, Theresa May will pay the EU £40 Billion of UK taxpayers money as an additional disgraceful, shameful capitulation to Brussels and further bitter punishment to the British people. Full breakdown of Chequers White Paper Brexit Betrayal by Martin Howe QC The Chequers proposals would involve the permanent continuation in the UK of all EU laws which relate to goods, their composition, their packaging, how they are tested etc etc in order to enable goods to cross the UK/EU border without controls. All goods on the UK manufactured in the UK for the UK domestic market, or imported from non-EU countries, would be permanently subject to these controls. There would be a general obligation to alter these laws in future whenever the EU alters its own laws, with a mechanism for Parliament to block such changes which is probably theoretical rather than practical. This would put the EU in a position to fashion its rules relating to goods so as to further the interests of continental producers against UK competitors, when we will have no right to vote on those rules. The obligation to follow the EU rulebook for goods would gravely impair our ability to conduct an independent trade policy.

"Please respect our day/s off Dear reader of one point four, please accept our sincerest apologies but the most recent Brexit betrayal by so-called Brexiteers in the Cabinet of Theresa May has left us so fucking disgusted and distraught that we may not be able to write anything for a day or so. Brexit Betrayal of 17,410,742 voters Usually we thrive on vitriol and anger, but this current betrayal has gone beyond any reasonable levels ever seen and some writers have even smashed their terminals.

Another writer was last seen walking down the High Street wearing nothing but a policeman’s hat.

"And the curtain falls with an almighty flop. With the sour news that a Soft Brexit was agreed by Brexiteers in Theresa May’s Cabinet, one can only think that this is a sad day for Britain. We liked Boris, but not any more, and as for the others like Gove, well, there is nothing left to say, apart from what a bunch of losers. The Theresa May proposal will tie the UK to the EU laws and regulations indefinitely. Businesses and agriculture will continue to be bogged down by EU red tape and regulations costing business and the Treasury billions every year. It is safe to also change the moniker for former Brexiteers in the Cabinet to Cowardeers, or just plain old Cowards would do the job. We have thus witnessed the end of the Conservative party as we knew it, many will cheer, and many will be relieved at their demise, but it will leave a gap in the political sphere, especially regarding Brexit. This is why it is time Nigel Farage comes back to either reignite UKIP or start an altogether different eurosceptic Brexit party. By bringing in a third party, the death of the Conservative party would be accelerated. Maybe as fitting punishment, vote Corbyn at the next election. Now is the time to completely abandon the Conservatives, simply because the party are no longer what they say they are. If you have ever voted for the Conservatives in the past, never do it again. This is a sad day for democracy in Britain.The Tories are a national disgrace, laced with traitors and yellow cowards not fit for purpose. And for this BRINO worse off position than before with no say, the UK will shuffle off £40 Billion to the EU?",1
"By ignoring over 17.8 million voters, the Tories could be out of power for over thirty years and deemed unelectable if the real Brexit is not adhered to, say a panel of political experts at the Institute of Electoral Behaviour and Political Science. Constitutional National Crisis “It is a certainty that if the mandated EU Referendum vote for Brexit Britain taking back control of its borders, laws and trade, as was voted for on June 23, 2016, is not delivered, then there will be a voter backlash against the Conservative government. Essentially, the people who voted for a Brexit will vote against the Conservatives, and remove the Tories condemning them to a long hiatus in the wilderness. We estimate the strength of feeling in this matter to result in a twenty to thirty year exile,” Dr. Philip Arthur, revealed. There is certainly a threat of a vast voter backlash if there are serious capitulations to Brussels, and this would not fare well with the Conservatives for a long time. “We have studied the data, and analysed the behavioural habits of voters concluding these results of a voter backlash. However, we have also concluded that not only could there be a backlash at the polls, but the resultant discontent could spread to mass civil disobedience and rioting for a period of thirty to forty years. This is not an exaggeration but a valid assessment of voter fury and public anguish over being betrayed and democracy circumnavigated for EU totalitarian rule.”",1
"Theresa May campaigned strongly for Remain during the EU Referendum - photo - Twitter Okay, let us supply some simple logic that most people will understand. Remoaners/Remainers do not want a Brexit. They do not want to leave the European Union. Makes no sense So, here’s the clincher. If these people, these Remoaners are against Brexit at all costs, why is the PM Theresa May, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, over half the Cabinet in charge of Brexit? Who thought up this piece of illogical nonsense? It has to be said that behind the scenes must reside a chief Remoaner who is directing this farcical tragedy, and they are responsible for putting these Remoaners into the pot to stir things up. There is no logic in letting a Remoaner fifty feet within a Brexit negotiation. That’s like asking your enemy’s collaborator to come and discuss an important war strategy meeting against your enemy. It is therefore a valid supposition that the reason for instating Remoaners into the high positions dealing with Brexit, is to completely thwart the process, and at the moment, it seems to be working very well. If there was to have been a real Brexit, Remoaners would have been kept well away, because they are actively working against Britain’s interests, and seek to destroy any thought of a proper Brexit as voted by 17.8 million voters on June 23, 2016 during the EU Referendum. Solution: Unless there is an immediate removal of Remoaners from the Brexit proceedings and governmental control, then there will not be a Brexit, but Brexit can be achieved if these Remoaners are removed. That is the only way a real Brexit can occur. The likelihood of this happening at the moment are however very slim, simply because the Brexiteers we have in the mix do not seem to want to make any sort of move to oust the quislings. Until they remove the Remoaners, there will be big problems resulting in a ‘Brexit In Name Only’ (BRINO) or in other words a ‘Soft Brexit’, where the UK is still controlled by the EU.",1
"Visiting the medieval cathedral city of Salisbury situated in the southern English county of Wiltshire can leave you positively paralysed with awe at the magnificent history behind this great place. The city lies only 9 miles away from Stonehenge, the prehistoric stone circle on the grassland of Salisbury Plain. You won’t be able to move away after your visit and will stay in that spot for a very long, long time. We have compiled a list of five wondrous landmarks to visit on your trip to Salisbury. NoviChok Forest – If you love acres and acres of trees then you will not love this place. Most of the trees within the forest are now dead or diseased from some type of mysterious chemical compound. There are still a few trees standing so when you bring your picnic gear be prepared for involuntary nervous twitches just before succumbing to complete paralysis and entering into a coma. ChokNovi Cathedral – This magnificent 13th Century cathedral also holds the Magna Carta, which has now been re-written in Russian. Sit on a pue, and listen to the Bishop bash away some inane outdated mythical nonsense whilst you are paralysed in your seat, unable to even move your fucking eyes. When it is time to pray, simply slump forward in a coma. Not unlike any other church experience we hear you say, however this one is vastly different, you rarely wake up…ever again. The NoviFish ChokShop – Situated on the High Street down a dark alley, to get there you must step over many comatose bodies. These poor souls tried to get to the fish shop for a bit of cod and chips, but sadly never made it. You probably won’t either as you feel your muscles seize up after a few steps. Putin’s Laughing Pub – For a real taste of Salisbury, this pub is full of Russians, most certainly FSB agents who spend their days laughing at the British secret service for such a poor job catching them. Curiously enough, it is the safest place now in Salisbury as there is no nerve agent present. Why would the Russians want to infect themselves? No non-Russians or dogs allowed at any time. NoviPizza Chok Restaurant – What better place to put your feet up and relax after a hard day’s sightseeing than this excellent pizzeria. The only problem is, before your dish is served up, your throat will suddenly feel tight as the paralysis sets in and you will spend the rest of the evening staring at your food, frothing and dribbling from the mouth whilst smelling the delicious aroma, but without the ability to eat it. Aaargh!",1
"One can’t forget the sad demise of Colombia’s Andres Escobar, El Caballero del Futbol, who scored an own goal against the USA in the 1994 World Cup and was subsequently murdered in cold blood when he got home to Colombia, brutally shot by a gunman as he relaxed at a cafe. The astounding England vs Colombia game last night at the Spartak stadium in Moscow was a tour de force of football and had spectators practically on their knees with excitement and anguish. End to end, with England leading by one goal, the Colombians pulled an equaliser out of a magician’s hat in the last minute of the game via numero 13, defender, Yerry Mina. Extra time to score that elusive goal, was elusive and we were onto penalties. This is the clincher, England are notorious at being shit at taking penalties, but this time around they bit the bullet and knuckled down with an excellent ‘thwack!’ from Eric Dier finalising the tally, thus consigning the Colombian team to another lonely and apprehensive journey home back to South America. Hopefully, Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca, who both missed their penalty shots, will be left in peace, and not gunned down just because some Cartagena cartel boss lost a bet. Returning to Colombia after leaving the World Cup, first thing to do is order in a posse of bodyguards until all the hysteria has calmed down a bit. ",1
"T he rivalry between Apple and Android is well documented, especially amongst the indie developers and their gaming community, but today we are taking a step back to congratulate Apple for introducing to the world their App Store. It was launched back on July 10, 2008 with a mere 500 apps. A press release published from Apple on their official website said: “it ignited a cultural, social and economic phenomenon that changed how people work, play, meet, travel and so much more.” There’s no question about that. Here’s three amazing bits of information from the press release. Today, the App Store is accessed by 1 billion users from 155 different countries, while as of June 2018 it has paid out over $100 billion to developers. The gaming industry is by far one of the biggest benefactors of the App Store. It has managed to bring a number of old and new titles to mainstream audiences. App Annie, one of the leading global providers of app market data, has compiled two lists that include the top games of all time worldwide based on downloads and consumer spend. Both reports take data from the iOS Store from July 2010 to May 2018. When it comes to the downloads top 10, the list is topped by Candy Crush Saga and then it’s followed by Subway Surfers, Fruit Ninja, Clash of Clans, Honour of Kings, Minion Rush, Angry Birds, Temple Run 1, 2 and Asphalt 8: Airborne. The usual suspects occupy the consumer spend list too, with the additions of Monster Strike and Puzzle & Dragons at numbers 3 and 4 respectively, Game of War at 7, while Clash Royale and Pokémon GO occupy numbers 9 and 10. App Annie estimates that while game apps account for 31% of downloads, 75% of the store revenue is generated from games. Even gambling brands, like casino and bingo sites that can be found on the review website Bingo Find have their own downloadable apps in the store. Nowadays, mobile gambling is a multi-billion pound business and the App Store has played its part in it, making these apps accessible to the masses. In more anniversary related news, according to SensorTower, Pokémon GO has managed to reach $1.8 billion in consumer spending after being on release for just two years. It is estimated that 58% of the revenue was generated from Google Play while the App Store accounted for the remaining 42%. Demonstrating the App Store’s influence, Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, creators of Candy Crush commented, “We launched Candy Crush Saga on the App Store over five years ago and it’s been hugely beneficial, allowing us to reach a brand new global audience. Our games have been played in all seven continents, including Antarctica! That shows just how influential and far-reaching the App Store has become.”",1
"Parliamentarians are on standby today at the House of Commons for an emergency delivery of a backbone for any MP who is willing to take it regarding Brexit. “We have already established that the Prime Minister, Theresa May does not have a backbone, and that many so-called Brexiteers are also deficient of one. Remoaners do not have backbones as standard. However, in the interests of the nation’s standing, we are prepared to deliver one to be installed into any MP who is willing and capable of accommodating such a thing as a fucking backbone,” one of the controllers of the Backbone Section located deep in Whitehall revealed. Spineless cowards If requested, the backbone would be delivered to a special room in the House of Commons where it would be implanted into the person, and then they would deliver a proper Brexit as mandated by the people on June 23, 2016. “A lot of these fellows don’t have backbones. They are yellow jelly bellied cowards, so it is not certain how we would implement the project,” another controller revealed. Certainly, there are many contenders amongst the Brexiteer team, however one of them has to really step up to receive the backbone, and even then things could backfire. “Well it’s not just a backbone that will be required. We’ll also need a pair of big swinging bollocks. Without that combination then the backbone will not have full effect. Sorry ladies, but in this scenario you need some serious guts, and we know some of the ladies in parliament have that, but the balls are the final clincher, and of course a cigar, a Havana permanently stuck in the mouth.” Time is running out…better get that backbone ready.",1
"“If you smoke enough of this shit, you definitely will think you are Jesus the Son of God and can perform miracles,” one Bible scholar commented after toking on a large joint. According to a team of Bible scholars from Colorado University, marijuana and cannabis oil were common place during the era of Jesus in Judea, and much of the population were whacked out on the stuff. “Like say I smoked three joints off the cuff, then rubbed cannabis oil all over my body and I was on a mountain. It is highly likely I would see a burning bush and hear it talking to me. I mean this shit is so strong you hallucinate with it. If you have schizoid tendencies, you might even hear the voice of God telling you you have to sacrifice your own son to prove your unquestionable allegiance to the God. For fuck’s sake man, if someone did this shit today they would put them away permanently in an asylum…but because in the days of little or no science and goat herders, they put it in a book and called it the word of God.” Cannabliss Although the Christian Bible was written by unknown authors 400 years after the supposed events took place, it has been posited that many of the writers were on drugs too. “From the rhetoric of the Bible which was written during the fall of the Roman Empire and its transition to Christianity, many of the mystics that wrote the stories were on cannabis. It was a staple drug for many writers because it was good for the imagination. Writing while whacked out on ganja opens up avenues never before seen, so these people were going on about fables and mysteries of the era and expanding on them. There are no records of Jesus ever existing, even though the Romans were meticulous record keepers for taxation purposes. One must understand that Jesus is an amalgamation of many deities from the region, and at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, they really needed something to supersede the authority of the emperors.” It was not only cannabis that many mystics took at the time, but psychotropic hallucinogenic substances derived from certain cacti, and plants. Harmal, Peganum harmala, was used all across the Middle East, not only as a mystical tool for hallucination but as a remedy for many ailments. Most world religions are derived from altered states of consciousness, and the root for many religions that still survive today comes from early shamanistic practices from early tribes who travelled the plains. These shamans ingested hallucinogenic plant derivatives and cannabis as an aid to acquiring an altered state of consciousness. “The process of grinding wild mushrooms, ingesting them then having an out of body hallucinogenic experience is as old as man itself. This dissociative state was seen as finding God. Basically, by taking mind altering drugs, man began to formulate their own religions from not only their surroundings but from their belief systems and expand upon these to create elaborate stories and religions. If you take enough drugs, you will see heaven, you will see hell and you will hear the words of God. Drugs are the channel to another state of awareness, and some say another dimension.” ",1
"When Remainer PM Theresa May says something, it generally means nothing, or it is doublespeak to enable further delaying tactics so that the outcome of said words is a muddled dish of confusion. Speaking to one group of people on one side, Theresa May says what they want to hear, then when speaking to the opposite side she will tell them exactly what they want to hear. The result is that nothing happens and the so-called event is delayed until it is too late, and the status quo can remain without any opposition. “I seek to confuse the Brexiteers, appease the Remoaners, and sincerely bow down to kiss the boots of the Brussels overlords. I am what would be deemed as a quisling, a sleeping agent within the highest office of government who detests the people, and their nefarious choice to leave the European Union. I say I believe in Brexit but that is not true. “My orders are thus to delay any exit from the EU for as long as possible, enabling Remoaners, the EU and the House of Lords to inflict as much pain on Brexit as possible. If I was a PM who wished for Brexit, this event would have occurred within three months of my instatement as PM, however I have eked proceedings out for over three years, and seek to delay for even more time.” As for the Brexiteers, they are fools for believing any words spoken from the PM, and yet they stand by, afraid to lose their positions in government more than their country’s future. This push and pull force, is a staple governmental technique utilised to fool the people, who watch daily as the appeasing headlines are released to the mainstream media. “Brexit is happening”, “Only Two Years to Brexit”, “EU Shaking in Their Boots”, “Support May in Her Brexit Victory”. Of course utter tosh and lies, but the people are placated easily, they actually believe the words they read in the papers, and the words that come out of Theresa May’s puppet mouth. The fucking stone cold truth is that there will be NO Brexit. No Brexiteers will stand up to Theresa May’s lies and Nigel Farage will stand by with the lot of them without doing anything. Remember these words clearly — The people’s vote does not matter. We are not living in a democracy. You have no rights as a voter to make a decision on the country’s future. The EU Referendum, 23 June 2016, is meaningless in the eyes of the EU, and controllers in charge of the government and business. Voters do not mean a thing in the UK. You are nothing to them.",1

We, today live by the standards and root of Latin, and this should be adhered to within our linguistic and societal discourse,” professor Reginald Dwight, told assembled college members at a recent meeting. Another scholar counteracted the argument by suggesting that the Latin word for black should be un-banned, therefore, the word for white, would be left alone and not banned as well. However, banning the word for the colour white in Latin, Album, could have implications in the music biz. Record executive, Donald D. Negreponte, for Warner Bros. was adamant that problems could arise. “What we gonna call albums then? We been callin’ that shiet albums since the beginning of the mufuggin’ recording industry. Niggaz need to all calm da fuck down, an shiet. I axe all y’all foos to stop runnin’ around like headless chickins and can the hysteria about Latin!” The discussion is ongoing, and many, especially in socialist states across America where there is a large African American lobby are not calling for the banning of the Latin word for the colour white, simply because it will mean that it is as important as the Latin word for black, which is banned from everyday usage. “You can’t ban the word white in Latin. Simply because by banning a word, you make it important, and you elevate it to a special status in linguistic usage. We don’t want whites to have the same special status as blacks in America, to use the word to lament over eternally, and to use it as a reason for our victim status. No! Definitely not,” Reverend Kessell Johnsons, said at a recent rally in Chicago.",1
"Less than a week after President Trump sought to dispel public outrage by signing an executive order ending the practice of separating children from parents illegally crossing into the U.S., there has been a second—altogether unexpected backlash—from the kids themselves. Abe Moskowitz, a lawyer for six-year-old Emanuel Honduro Gonzalez, claims that once his client was reunited with his parents “he went into a full blown panic.” Emanuel was apparently having the time of his life in the cage. “Kids to befriend, an array of toys, plus state-of-the-art air-conditioning.” Moskowitz went on to point out that Emanuel’s situation certainly beat “trekking across the infernal 140 degree Arizona desert with only cactus needles as sustenance.” Emanuel’s reaction is in no way unique. Indeed, CNN has reported hundreds of cases of kids “kicking and screaming” and “throwing toys at I.C.E. members” once confronted with the crushing reality that they would be reunited with their parents. Analysis Psychologist Amanda Beasley, a professor at Yale University, explained it this way. “A child under the guidance of his parents is actually a thousand times more imprisoned than a child in a cage.” Beasley went on to suggest that “real individuation must start early—perhaps even a few weeks after the child is expelled from the womb.” Social Worker, Zeke Thomas, however, has a different point of view. “These kids are suffering from a cage-based version of Stockholm syndrome. The allure they have for their cages simply makes no rational sense!” Complicating matters further, many parents are reacting in unexpected ways to seeing their children again. Gloria Espinoza, a mother from Honduras, started feeling despondent and had to go on Lexapro shortly after being reunited with her three sons. Before she could watch Telemundo for days without interruption, but now she spends all her free time breastfeeding, changing diapers, and, on occasion, narrowly avoiding getting bludgeoned to death by a building block. Lupe Constanza feels similarly despondent and now takes a heavy-dose of Ativan since the return of her nine daughters and two sons has brought on a series of uncontrollable panic attacks. “I thought Trump was like Hitler for keeping us apart,” she said. “But now I think the real crime against humanity is reuniting our family. Some kids belong in cages.” DS Guest writer: Matt Nagin",1
"From across the pond, somewhat removed, it is hard to see the American socialists making such a fool of themselves. These are supposedly inclusive people with an ideology of progressive tolerance and yet they are acting like fascists; non inclusive, intolerant, prone to censor, authoritarian, totalitarian and increasingly violent. Hitler himself would be proud of the Democrats because they are exhibiting the exact behaviour of the Nazi party leading up to World War II. Hitler’s National Socialist party was a form of socialism and left wing, they were intolerant of other views, they censored heavily and shut down any form of free speech. This is the left wing credo now, an intolerant, non inclusive hate mongering mob of thugs who cannot discuss anything in a civil educated manner. Your own hatred for Trump creates more hatred, because you are stuck in the mindset of anger, you create more anger, and your unwillingness to discuss or even acknowledge anything that is not in your worldview creates more discord and alienation. Donald Trump against the backdrop of wailing, whining violent bullying democrats looks civilised. Against the baying democrat hounds answering the race baiting call for violent action from Maxine Waters, Trump is again, the civilised one. The same goes for Peter Fonda, asking for paedophiles to rape Trump’s 11-year-old son, Barron. Donald Trump is the civilised one. To see Trump’s administrative staff hounded out of restaurants, confronted outside their homes, is similar in behaviour to the Jews in Nazi Germany being turfed out of shops and other public spaces. There is no positive mature educated behaviour being exhibited by American socialists at the moment, and frankly, you are the bad guys, because you are acting like bad guys act in everything you are doing. If it is violence the American socialists crave, then they would not fare well in a fight, because they don’t own guns, and don’t know how to shoot straight, whereas the conservatives do and can. Every day, Trump is increasing in strength, power and stature, whilst the democrats are looking increasingly dilapidated and silly. This applies to the media companies, the Hollywood celebrities, the pseudo-Marxist fascist university professors indoctrinating their flock, and the bleeding heart socialist thugs who have to virtue signal at every point of their miserable insufferable existence. Sometimes it pays to step back and look in to see what reality is really about, and for American socialists who manage to do that, they will not like what they see. For positive change to occur nationally, globally all sides must join collectively and inclusively because fighting only creates more fighting. Step back for one second and take a look…",1
"The BET awards are one place where anything can happen! American BET Awards took place on June 24 in Los Angeles. Tiffany Haddish walked away with the best actress award. The girl had it coming. It’s amazing how Tiffany made to the top in the BET Awards. She won the award for best actress. The category was so fierce, the other nominees where big names in the Television and Film industry. Tiffany had to compete with Angela Bassett who plays Romanda (Queen) in the movie Black Panther. A movie that was big at the awards eventually winning the Best Movie award. The superhero has become so big he is likely to get a couple of real money slots from online casino gambling sites based on him. Taraji P Henson who plays Cookie Lyon so well as in the series Empire holds the best actress title for the BET Awards 2016. People fell in love with Lupita Nyong’o who played Nakia. She became everyone’s darling in Black Panther. These were some of the actresses that were also nominated in the best female actress category along with Issa Rae and Letitia Wright, two actresses making waves in Hollywood.

"Hollywood celebrities have their moments and these come and go for the fickle starlets, where everything is given to them on a platter at the click of a finger. We had the adoption craze, and even one where celebrities kept dung beetles as the latest must-have pet. The latest craze is somewhat topical, as it relates to the Obama era policy of putting South American illegal migrants in cages at the U.S. border. Charlie Sheen now likes to spend weeks in a cage four feet across in a darkened room with only a box of cigarettes to accompany him and a pot of rancid water. Speaking from his cage in his Hollywood mansion, Sheen was eager to reveal the benefits of the new craze amongst celebrities. “I feel like I’m a kid who just walked across the border from Guatemala. It makes me proud to be American, because I not only feel at one with the United States, and Obama who started this practice, but I feel like a lost kid. Like I sit in the corner like this, I cry out for my mama and suck my thumb. I even have a blanket, although I burned some holes in this one with cigarette ash. I feel safe here. I don’t wanna get out.” Another celebrity who has adopted the cage life is Danny Devito, who sits in his cage and even wears a nappy. “I asked Arnie the other day if he wanted to join me in my cage. He said no, because he could not even fit his leg in it. They (Devito’s Mexican servants) cart me around the house in my cage, and they feed me burritos through the little hole. It makes me feel good as a liberal champagne socialist to be treated like those kids at the border, like I can atone for my liberal values by sitting in this cage and receiving the same punishment those poor Mexican bastards receive at the border.” There have been accidents though, and one celebrity did not fare too well whilst in her cage. Roseanne Barr tried out cage life after being barred from her own show because she uttered a few words on Twitter that were deemed racist. “They (the producers of her show) actually put me in the cage without my consent. Then they started making ‘Ook ook’ noises to show me what it feels like to be on the receiving end of racism. I cried and cried, but they still did not give me my own show back.” As for actor Peter Fonda, his latest hobby is not so much centred around a cage but an echo chamber. It could be described as a left-leaning digital prison where people parrot the same ol’ leftist outrage and it echoes from one side to the other for eternity — i.e Twitter.",1
"T he Epica Awards announces its new jury president, two new grand prix and a dynamic ad campaign from Wieden + Kennedy The luncheon held in Cannes on June 21 announced the latest set-up for the Epica Awards in 2018. Epica will hold its next jury meeting, conference and ceremony in Amsterdam from November 12 to 15. The ceremony itself will be held at the city’s KIT Royal Tropical Institute. This year’s jury president will be Tony Chambers, Brand and Content Director of Wallpaper* magazine. He commented: “As someone who’s passionate about design, branding and communications, I’m delighted to be able to join fellow journalists in these fields to determine who’s doing the most innovative creative work right now.” The competition’s visually striking new advertising campaign has been created by Wieden & Kennedy in Amsterdam. It reflects Epica’s impartial approach and unique positioning. In addition, Epica announced the creation of two new grand prix. The Responsibility Grand Prix will honour the best public interest work. It is supported by ACT Responsible, an organisation that supports cause-related advertising. The Alternative Media Grand Prix will be awarded to the most original campaign in non-traditional channels such as ambient, experiential, events and stunts. Two new categories to take note of this year: Topical & Real Time Advertising, covering operations that react to current events; and of course the return of World Cup Advertising. Epica’s editorial director Mark Tungate said: “As usual we’re always trying to evolve with the industry, and we felt that both these grand prix were lacking: one specifically recognizing creativity for good causes; and the other celebrating originality in the range of channels beyond traditional advertising.” He added: “It will be a pleasure to present these and the other awards in Amsterdam, one of our favourite locations over the years due to its creative vitality.” He also thanked Epica’s sponsors and partners: Adobe, ACT, AdForum, Euronews, Lürzer’s Archive and Screen Vision Media.",1
"All Rights Reserved Hans Soylo Kathleen Kennedy, the Disney film producer who incorporated a new feminized version of Star Wars replete with soy progressive ideologies, black and Vietnamese characters, transgender lesbians, female leads and polysexual robot fetishists, has now outraged Star Wars fans further by introducing an even more crazy character into the mix — Donald Duck. The most recent Hans Soylo film flopped so hard at the box office that it did not even recoup the initial production costs let alone the astronomical marketing bill. Hans Soylo lost the film production company over $700 million dollars. “Donald’s going to appear in the next Hans Soylo episode as a duck from the planet Quack. He will teach Hans Soylo about the ways of flying the Millennium Falcon. What better creature to teach Hans Soylo than a duck that has little wings that cannot actually lift him off the ground, plus Donald will be the first homosexual transgender lesbian soy drinking duck to frequent space, making it a sublime first in cinema..we’re breaking the boundaries.” an excited Kennedy revealed at yesterday’s press release in Los Angeles. It seems the Star Wars franchise has been going from bad to worse, however the introduction of a talking duck should infuriate die hard Star Wars fans even further. “Are you fucking kidding me? A fucking duck? This goes beyond the atrocious Hans Soylo film which was boycotted by many true fans, and has made a huge loss in cinema sales. This news is beyond that Jamaican nasty, Jar Jar Binks! These Disney and LucasArts people have ruined the franchise!” an irate true Star Wars fan revealed. “A New Duck Bill” is currently in production and will cost an estimated $975 million to produce. Prepare to lose the fucking lot..you idiots.. Entertainment website, Entertainment quoted on its website that the film should be out for release by Christmas.

"Champagne socialists have been going crazy on the internet over images of immigrant children in cages blaming Trump, when in fact, those pictures were taken in 2014 during the Obama presidency. Of course, because Obama was a socialist president, there was no outrage then, but because Trump is a conservative president today, the policies of Obama are being foisted on the shoulders of Trump. Actor Peter Fonda, was quoted on twitter after seeing the Obama era pictures: “WE SHOULD RIP BARRON TRUMP FROM HIS MOTHER’S ARMS AND PUT HIM IN A CAGE WITH PEDOPHILES AND SEE IF MOTHER WILL WILL STAND UP AGAINST THE GIANT ASSHOLE SHE IS MARRIED TO. 90 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ON THE SAME WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY. FUCK,” What many ‘low information’ champagne socialists do not know is that the policy of putting immigrant children in cages was instated by the Obama administration. Since the outrage directed at the president is unjust and misguided, he has even gone out of his way to apply an executive order reversing many of the Obama era ICE policies. Naturally, the outrage shown by democrats has been used to its full effect against the Trump administration even though the policies they are crying over were instated by Obama. What a bunch of hypocritical wining low information idiots. ",1
"The unscripted Obama docu-series for Netflix will air in September on the stock market listed company’s streaming service. The Obamas, who have kept a relatively low profile since leaving office, have established a company named Lower Ground Productions to manage the project. The New York Times has previously reported the former president was in talks to develop shows “that highlight inspirational gay and transexual stories” rather than delve into cheap political smears of conservative views and attitudes. The first episode of the series will focus on the bath houses of San Francisco and how they were instrumental in the emancipation of promiscuous gay men who spread AIDS across the country during the eighties. “I attended the bath houses a lot during filming, and it was truly inspirational to see the boys doing their thang. I was the towel boy, they would tell me which cubicle to go clean up, you know with a mop and a dirt rag. I talk in depth about the decor of these places, and the clients who frequent,” Obama revealed. During filming, Obama sustained an injury to his lower back after slipping on a load of semen left on the floor by a dozen men enjoying the bath house. “One minute I was holding the mop, then whoops, I fell flat on my back. Luckily I was brought back to my feet by some hunky guys who then taught me a lesson or three for being so gymnastic in their presence.” “I have a dream..” The episode will suggest that every American city and town must have bath houses installed, not only to comply with modern inclusion rules, but to provide a firm ground for the spread of HIV throughout the country. “I have a dream. Every city corner, every town centre, to have at least two or three gay bath houses,” Obama says defiantly at the end of the episode. Michelle Obama’s series will air in conjunction to zee’s husband, and will talk about inspiring transsexual stories, the first episode starring Michelle Obama.",1
"Siding with the enemy Dominic Grieve, the supposed Conservative who is trying his hardest to thwart and ruin Brexit, is a Griefer, a Remoaner, a lickspittle traitorous pustule boil upon the arse of treachery. His liaisons with Alistair Campbell and Brussels belies a monetary connection pushing this villainous swine as he gobbles from the trough of inequity and greed. Scum like Grieve are the ones who are now ruling the roost, and are supported by the PM as she instated these people into fray in the first place. Theresa May also instated Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who has thwarted Brexit at every turn from within the Treasury and now pushes massive tax hikes to punish the people for daring to vote Brexit. To be strung up from a lamp post by the neck is the only good outcome for Dominic Grieve and his Haw Haw brethren, as the people throw rotten tomatoes at the swinging traitor amidst the buzzards and flies. Of course, this is a figurative scenario, as these things do not happen today, however if there were to be a peoples uprising, you never know what could happen. Griefers These Griefers are pushing the people to the limit. The people voted for freedom, they voted for control of our own laws, they voted for sovereignty, and they voted for extrication from the inhibitive regulations dictated by unelected bureaucrats from Brussels. So far, we have waited, and waited receiving nothing. Instead, day after day, we see these pathetic morose Remoaners hijacking the Will of the People as promised by parliament at the time. What about the other treaties that were signed without any parliamentary say, or even any consultation of the people? The Lisbon Treaty was secretly signed away by Gordon Brown, and gave away much of Britain’s sovereignty. It was quickly taken through without even a consultation or murmur. No one of course mentions that, or any other pro-EU treaty that was secretly pushed through without any consultation or ‘Meaningful Vote’. These are double standards and hypocrisy. Business 101, you cannot go to the deal table without the ability to walk away. If you do not have the ability to walk away, you have effectively lost any bargaining power, and are defenceless. This is what the Remoaners and traitors are seeking to do with Brexit. Their treachery and hatred for Britain bolstered purely by their own greed as they receive large pension funds and payoffs from the enemy, Brussels. Choke on it Hope you enjoy the money you have acquired by selling off your own country to people who mean only harm to the UK, Dominic Grieve. Your Remoaner treason may hopefully one day come back to haunt you, as you choke on the thousands of pounds/euros put into your accounts by Brussels. May your duck houses flourish with diseased ducks and your country mansions paid for by your treachery rot with inequity and bad luck.",1
"On her latest trip to Strasbourg for an EU meeting on mass unfettered migration into the Schengen zone, Chancellor Angela Merkel was caught up in a rather embarrassing situation. “The Chancellor was dropped off and was making her way to her train platform when she was greeted by a number of migrant men washing their feet and other body parts from a tap on the main concourse,” Merkel’s attache, Hans Gruper, told Bild. The Chancellor was immediately embarrassed by the situation and tried to sneak past the collection of men washing. At one point, a man pulled down his trousers and proceeded to wash his anus with nothing more than his hand and cold water. One onlooker found the event quite amusing. “I saw Merkel holding her breath as she attempted to sneak past the group, but the sight of the man’s anus being washed in front of everyone was too much, even for the Chancellor. Of course, it is not the fault of the migrants, this is how they live in their culture and are not phased by such actions, but in Germany it is not normal or civil behaviour.” Chancellor Merkel did eventually catch her train to France, albeit with a little trauma on the way. Since the massive influx, in Europe it is quite common to see such displays in public places.",1
"The newly appointed Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, attends a Number 10 briefing shortly after his attack. Lawless London Update In a recent tabloid interview, Mr Javid said he was standing outside Euston station when the moped thugs rode on to the pavement. They deposited a large Zombie knife deep into his head and zoomed off, he said, which left him “angry and upset”. He said he is now working on a review to give police more power to pursue moped murderers and thugs. “Before I knew what was happening, this large Zombie knife was embedded firmly in my brain,” said Mr Javid, who was appointed home secretary in April, becoming responsible for the UK’s policing and security. Speaking of the incident, which happened last Tuesday, he said: “I was angry and upset but thought myself lucky they did not steal my precious iPhone or Rolex watch as have many who fall prey to these vicious criminals.” His revelation comes days after unfunny ‘comedian’ Michael McIntyre was robbed by men on a moped in north-west London. Home Office proposals announced this month aim to ban the sale of the weapon of choice of these moped thugs — Zombie knives. The new Home Office rules will also give police powers to pursue criminals if they have committed a crime. “If someone commits a crime and police want to pursue them, they should be allowed to.” Meanwhile in London, it is all too easy to acquire hand guns, sold for as little as £50 a piece in most pubs, and even though Zombie knives are now banned as well these can easily be found in any open market for £10.

"Theresa May frankly is not capable of negotiating her way out of a paper bag let alone a proper Brexit as voted by 17.4 million people. Concession after concession has left the government with no negotiating power with Brussels, and is now swamped not only by the House of Lords, but by traitorous Remainer MPs on the Soros payroll. These greedy treacherous swine Haw Haw Remainers, who are willing to betray Britain for a few quid are vile miserable creatures only fit for the stocks, to be displayed to all and sundry as rotten tomatoes and excrement are thrown at their ugly putrid faces. The devil’s daughter has thus spawned another batch of slimy eggs from her overworked puckered anus, as she delivers another Remainer plot to derail Brexit with a disgusting squishy popping sound. Soubry, a militant treasonous satanic witch deserves only one thing, to be punted full force in her grime box. Maybe it is time to punish the useless Conservatives once and for all. No one dared to oust the pigeon liver’d lying coward with no backbone May, even though she has shown countless times to be a retrograde abhorrent Remainer not worthy of a squirt of piss from a pig’s straining bladder. Punish them – Vote Corbyn Vote for Jeremy Corbyn. Never vote for the Tories again. Yes, this would be the ultimate punishment not only for those who messed up a clear and easy opportunity to leave the EU once and for all but for the country which will fall into deep economical malaise once Agent Cobb begins his Bolshevik revolution. To coin a Burke cliche, ‘All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.’ Certainly, this has been the case. Where was Boris? He jibber jabbered but did nothing apart from tout useless bridge projects across the Irish sea. Same goes for the Reese-Mogg, IDS and Farage, and Gove, and Davis. They were all talk but no substance, they blabbered like little old ladies around a knitting circle but did fuck all. You Sirs, with the utmost disrespect have been useless, because Theresa May is still PM, and she has fudged the whole Brexit debacle into a maelstrom of unworkable manure, a quagmire of intersecting Remainer plots all culminating at the Remainer Treasury held by that glib fustilarian miserable wart, Hammond. Let us all now vote for Jeremy Corbyn, the ultimate insult to the nation, and deserved punishment that will destroy Britain forever. Let the riots begin, from town to town, rubbish stacked high in the streets, discontent, looting and anarchy. This is no Brexit Theresa May is setting up, in fact, Britain will be worse off, and still tied to the EU for eternity. Do not dare to even call it a Brexit, it is a Brino — Brexit in Name Only. Parliament is dead, it died a long time ago. ",1
"President Trump has achieved more in one year of office than eight years of Obama. As former president and token black president Obama sat on his haunches for eight years whilst twiddling his Marxist agenda around, Trump has achieved economic success, and something no other U.S. president could achieve — a peace treaty with North Korea. Now that Kim Jong Un has come in from the cold, the Democrats are very silent…apart from Robert De-Niro who yesterday said the eloquent words ‘Fuck Trump’. What happened to Bobby eh, he was great in the early days, Deer Hunter, King of Comedy, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, Heat, but now he has turned into some sort of sap who can only make threats to a president who is actually moving mountains and get parts in shit movies like The Intern. Who would have thought, De Niro’s politics were that of a red commie bastard? What a fucking douche. Over in old Blighty, we wish we had half the leadership of Trump, instead we are being led by a grey old boot Remainer with no fucking balls, no guts or charisma. Theresa May is a wet diarrhoea spillage not worthy of anything but the glue factory where they send old forgotten nags to get processed. She is a dead rotting carcass with no life, no chutzpa, no plan, and has wrecked Brexit simply because of her insipid lifeless non-personality, her purposeful stalling, and her treasonous Remainer appointees. What did Obama achieve apart from introduce a failing health care system into America that is costing people way more for way less treatment? Obama lost the Ukraine to Russia. Obama spent trillions of U.S. taxpayers money on useless socialist pet projects that have doomed future generations of America to vast un-payable debt. When Obama was elected U.S. debt was 9 trillion, at the end of his eight year reign it was 23 trillion dollars. Where is Barack Hussein Obama now? Who fucking cares? Him and his horrid cantankerous moose beast of a wife can rot in obscurity and Oprah appearances. Trump has done more for African Americans than Obama ever did. He has brought massive employment to blacks, and also is not agitating the racial situation, something that Obama and his pal Soros tried to do during his evil term of office. The constant riots and agitating, the race baiting, was all Obama, who encouraged African Americans to riot pushing racial disharmony and hatred of white Americans. History has spoken and Donald Trump has Trumped Obama a thousand times over. As for Nobel Peace prizes, if Trump does not get one for his achievement in North Korea, then it is a flawed, biased prize, because Obama only got the prize for the colour of his skin, and he achieved nothing during his tenure. What’s left for Trump now? Well, we got the wall, the trade war to make things fairer, a possible Iran incursion and cleaning out the Marxist agitators from internal governmental operations, amongst many other projects in the pipeline. Bravo Trump, balls of fucking steel. On the other hand, what does this mean for the world order? How will N. Korea fit into the Trump World Order? Could there be a disturbance in the Force?",1
"Men have been continually attacked, vilified and made into third rate citizens for decades by the media, feminists and general anti-male #metoo one woman agenda. It comes as no surprise then that men are just leaving women alone, because in the end men cannot win if they help a woman or leave them alone. No doubt, this is what happened in a recent incident in the London Underground when a woman was attacked verbally and physically by a mentally unstable nutter. The two men in the carriage casually walked off into the adjoining carriage leaving the woman alone with her attacker. There is little cause for modern feminist women to be alarmed by this, because it is a hole dug solely by themselves as they have alienated men to such a level that men are going their own way, and leaving women alone to get on with it. The chivalrous male still lives on only in the imagination, because to open a door for a woman is seen as a serious sexist chauvinist act, and to protect a woman in this day and age can lead to men being prosecuted for sexist outrage, let alone daring to compliment a woman on her looks. One cannot even ask a woman out on a date, or her phone number without being dragged through the courts, or feminist friendly newspapers. The media is now chock block full of articles where innocent men are charged with rape when in the past it would be labelled as bad fumbling uncommunicative sex. The #metoo generation is one of thug rule, of judgement and sentence before fair trial, of alienating men to such a level that repair of the damage meted on relations with the opposite sex are nigh on impossible. It is to this sorry end, that many men now leave women alone even when they see a female being viciously attacked. This is what Third Wave Feminism has created and this is the lonely bed women must now lie in.",1
"The President of the United States, Donald Trump was told off for doing a series of large shits on one of the G7 summit tables during a luncheon. Much like a puppy has to be broken in, the summit leaders, Angela Merkel and French President Macron, along with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told the American president off for his big smelly turds, which attracted large bluebottle flies into the luncheon room. German Chancellor, Angela Merkel scolded the Donald for ‘doing a very very bad thing, mein gott!’ and even threatened to rub his nose in it as a lesson. Watched by other G7 summit attendees, even the Japanese PM balked at the disgusting display, upturning his nose when the smell hit his nostrils. The incident occurred during luncheon, when all the delegates were sitting at their tables, and the food was served. “We had just been served the first course of celeriac risotto, toasted buckwheat, truffle, Chanterelle mushrooms, rosemary and celery leaf when Mr. Trump stood up, undid his trousers and pulled down his Y-fronts. He then positioned his large buttocks over the plate and these large turds came out of his asshole as he grunted with gusto. He seemed to find it pleasurable as his eyes rolled up showing only the whites as large pieces of excrement flopped unceremoniously onto the table and plate. The smell hit us immediately and some delegates vomited. Mr. Trump giggled like a little boy as he wiped his messy ass with the expensive cloth napkins, even grabbing Theresa May’s napkin when finished with his one,” a shocked Canadian PM Trudeau recalled. After the display, the delegates crowded around Mr. Trump to tell him off and tried to educate him in the ways of G7 summit etiquette. Political commentator and psychologist, Bernard Ernst, examined Trump’s behaviour and tried to rationalise it afterwards. “Mr Trump is a primal animal. This is the way he showed his displeasure, by taking a big shit on the table. It is obvious that he does not approve of events at the G7 summit, and what he also did was to designate the area as his territory, much like a dog does with urine and excrement.” It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump will be invited back to the next G7 Summit.",1
"Under the careful apathetical watch of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, London’s murder rate is now triple of Bogota or Cartagena. Tourists who are keen to experience this phenomenon are travelling to London to encounter the murder first hand. Juan Motola, 43, from Fort Lauderdale, USA, is fascinated by grim tales of the city’s past: “I would read about Jack the Ripper and what he did in the East End when I was a kid. I always imagined the cobbled streets of London amongst the fog and flashes of knives as a poor lady of the night was gutted and left for all to see. I’m coming to the death capital this time to see it all first hand.” Tourists don’t need to buy expensive tickets to the London Dungeons, or Madame Tussauds, because the real action is on the streets. Stewart Penrose, a crime consultant reveals the best times to get murdered in the city, as well as the prime spots for a quick dispatch. “You don’t want to come onto the streets at rush hour in the morning from 7am to 10am. The reason for this is that the Afro Caribbean gangs who commit most of the crime don’t have jobs, and are usually still in bed. If you want a good stabbing, walk the streets after about midday, and of course the night time is the best for getting shanked or chopped by a machete. Don’t forget to flash your Rolex watch or expensive camera wherever you go, this will quicken your demise considerably. South of the river is now the best place to go to get murdered. It’s like the Wild West.” Because there are no police on the streets of London anymore, thanks to the London Mayor’s orders, violent crime has risen as much as by 80% in some areas. Tourist Abel Dannon, from France arrived in London on a Tuesday, and had been murdered by Wednesday his brother revealed. “He was sad about breaking up with his girl. He bought a one way ticket to London, and we wondered why. According to reports, he was seen walking down Croydon High Street holding up job application leaflets. The last I heard was it was a quick death for him. About twenty thugs descended upon him with machetes. People just stepped over his mangled body for hours.” Indeed, murder now is so common place that many bodies scattered on the streets are routinely ignored. “It’s just another day in a Labour run city. I had to step over four bodies and a severed hand this morning on the way to work. Luckily I did not spoil my suit,” Stockbroker, Giles Mathers, revealed in the Evening Standard newspaper.

"This year’s prestigious Bilderberg meeting will be held in the beautiful city of Turin nestled deep in the Italian countryside. The vistas of the city and its renowned architecture will satisfy the attendees from the delicately decorated roof gardens where we will convene after the meetings in the evening. To say it is a great honour to be invited would be an understatement, but after our recent Kissinger interview it was somewhat expected. At the moment, I’m trying to figure out what to take in my little bag (not the old lady) to the luxurious hotel we have been booked in. Sorry mes amis, but I cannot divulge the location, but will give you a few tips. It is relatively close to the Royal Palace, and a 5-minute walk from Piazza Vittorio Veneto, it is however near a grotty shopping centre, not that delegates will do much walking. Valentino Castle – former residence of Royal House of Savoy. As with regulations, on pain of death, I cannot say much more. All this tosh about groups of young ladies being escorted into the rooms is something I can say does not happen. You only get to choose one or two for the night, not more than three much to my chagrin, and there is a pecking order, hopefully no sloppy seconds or thirds. George ‘7 Jobs’ Osborne and other Remoaners will be attending, they seek to fight the populism encroaching on their territory, and I will be the dissenting voice of reason to their avarice and greed. The food presented to the delegates will no doubt be something to be savoured. Last time I was in Turin I thoroughly enjoyed the Piemonte cuisine, especially from a restaurant situated within the grounds of Rivoli castle itself, yes it only has a single Michelin star, but the food was unspeakably agreeable to my palate. The Fassona fillet is certainly one reason to get back there, you can practically die for such delights. All these conspiracy theory nutcases and their tinfoil hats have got it all wrong. Alex Jones and his demented website with his rabid evangelical Christian fanatics can all go and swivel on Satan’s bulbous erect helmet for all I care. This is why, we’re giving you prior news right now dear reader of one point four, because there will most probably be a news blackout from the Squib lasting for a day or two depending on how much good stuff I consume. When it is time to get back to the murder capital of the world, bad old Londinium, the inane nonsensical stories will no doubt resume. There you have it, you have all been priorly warned. Turin, Italy",1
"On a book tour in Harlem, New York, the former president, Bill Clinton revealed why he is fully backing the #MeToo man-hating agenda which has turned into a mob ruled witch hunt of anything masculine. “When I allegedly raped those women who claimed I allegedly raped them, I did it with their full consent…allegedly. It’s of course their #MeToo right to claim I raped them, but I was too balls deep at the time to even think about anything. You know when you’re moving inside, it just feels like home to me, you lose all track of time or anything from the sheer pleasure, there ain’t nothing wrong with doing it, so I got no need to apologise for something that feels so goddamn right. As a #MeToo campaigner, I say to these women, I say, “Me too” I know how it feels when people don’t believe a word you say is true. I never lied a day in my life.” During the book signing, a woman who looked suspiciously like Monica Lewinsky, smoking a long soaking wet cigar, was in the line awaiting a signed copy of the book, she was replete in a blue dress with many crusty white stains all over the front and back. One woman in the queue said she smelled of stale semen and Havana, and complained to the publisher’s assistant who was attending the signing. “I’m not sure what her game was, but I called her out, and when she saw she was rumbled she quickly fled the store in tears,” the woman from New Jersey said. Hissssssssssssss Just at that moment, there was a hissing sound which filled the whole room causing everyone, including Bill Clinton to turn around. The horrific sound emanated from Hillary Clinton who turned up wearing a scarf over her thick overcoat in the 90 degree heat, stumbling all over the floor, her eyes seemed to not have any control in where they looked. At one point, one eyeball looked to left whilst the other went right. One spectator was traumatised by the sight. “I saw Hillary hissing in anger. Like with real venom. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. She had seen Monica in the queue and got off her wheelchair much to the concern of her physician. Her tongue was long, it fluttered and flickered like a lizard or snake’s. She went towards Bill full of rage, but luckily was stopped when she fell flat on her face and knocked herself out completely.” It’s safe to say that Bill Clinton and co. have landed precipitously in the #MeToo generation with an almighty squishy bang!",1
"E very four years during the summer, the number of ‘unauthorised absences’ at UK businesses suffers a sharp upturn. This head-scratching anomaly is made even more curious by the fact that the four-year cycle matches the four-year circle of the FIFA World Cup, precisely. Of course, in reality this convergence of sickies and football is not too hard to understand, and a recent survey held by the football tipping site FootballTips.com had revealed that workers in the UK are not exactly abashed to admit that they ‘play hookey’ during the four weeks of the world’s greatest sporting tournament. Naturally, one of the main joys of sneaking off work during the World Cup Finals is getting away with it scot-free – but if you’re tempted to miss work to watch Panama take on Tunisia during this year’s finals, then don’t rest on your laurels that you’re going to get away with it. Out of the 2,203 people aged eighteen and over questioned by FootballTips, 41% of them said they’d been hauled in front of their bosses for a dressing down over their absenteeism. The first question asked in the survey was “How many days will you take off work to watch the World Cup this year?”. The average answer was a whopping seven days, but when asked how many of these absences would be unauthorised, that figure dropped to four. Hopefully you’re asking yourself where are these companies that allow employees to take three ‘authorised’ absences just to watch football. Survey respondents were also asked if they had taken time of work to watch the 2014 World Cup, and 68% of them said that they had, and, as mentioned above, 41% of those who took time off for the football found themselves in trouble for doing so. If you need to find some quick bogus excuses for time off during this year’s finals, note that ‘a doctor’s appointment’ was the most popular reason given by employees for a World Cup sickie at 32%, with a straightforward ‘I’m too ill to work’ next at 20%. Winning the third-place play-off is ‘a family emergency’ at 17%. Calculating the cost the World Cup makes to the UK economy is no easy task, but if we take that 44.5 million people watched the 2014 World Cup in the UK, and that 43% of them were in full-time employment, that gives a workforce of 19 million people. If each took seven days of seven hours off at a rate of around £14 per hour, that gives us (19 million x 7 x 7 x 14) £13 billion in lost revenue. A spokesman for FootballTips, Tom Rooney, said “The World Cup is of course a hugely important time for many of us living in the UK, even though England usually do terribly. It is surprising how many people plan to take time off to watch the games, especially as over half of this time is likely to be unauthorised. If you do plan to pull a sickie instead of going to work, at least avoid posting anything on social media!” Let’s hope for the UK’s economy that England don’t go and win the 2018 version of the tournament, else the total money lost could become astronomical!",1
"Croydon, London Labour’s London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has justified the current crime spree amongst predominantly black people as a ‘natural form of population control’ and has even gone on to proclaim it as a form of ‘eugenics’. It was in fact the socialist creed of William Beveridge, the architect of the post-1945 welfare state, and highly active member in the eugenics movement who said that “those men who through general defects are unable to fill such a whole place in industry are to be recognised as unemployable. They must become the acknowledged dependents of the State… but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood”. The plan in those days was simple, as proposed by other socialist thinkers like Bertrand Russell. The gene pool for the elite must not be tainted by inferior bloodlines, and all ‘useless eaters’ should be sterilised or aborted before birth. Today, they’re just killing themselves off with mass stabbings and shootings. Nothing to Lose As the disenfranchised ethnic youth today in London continue on their stabbing sprees, the problem today is one predominantly of the Afro-Caribbean youth.

They are ill educated, with no desire for education or legitimate jobs. They are essentially wild feral beasts on the rampage, and can only express themselves with extreme violence, thuggery and thievery. These are Labour’s children. We cherished and nurtured their non-education through our welfare system by rewarding failure. We invited their parents in to this country knowing full well their children would create complete chaos, fear and discord, as this was good for our socialist longterm agenda to always have ‘useless eaters’ vying for our supposed help and vote for us. By throwing millions and billions of taxpayers money at these feckless feral runts we thus undermined the capitalist system which we abhor so much,” the Labour Mayor’s office said in a statement earlier today. Many parts of South London, and urban council estates are now war zones thanks to the Labour policies of the past where it was mandatory to build estates bang in the middle of affluent areas. This form of social engineering has created clear delineation, where on one side the affluent live in perpetual fear, and on the other the chaotic hopeless create crime. “In London, you can live in a £3 million property, but walk a few yards across the road and you will find a council estate where drug gangs rule, where people are stabbed daily, and where the disenfranchised only have to look out of their windows to see how the other half live. It is possibly a cruel form of torture for these people who know that the only way they will receive any large reward is by drug running or by murder. This is what Labour created. At least in cities like Paris, the poor are bundled in high rises only on the outskirts of the city, and out of sight, although with the Schengen zone, things have recently changed and the tent cities from the African continent have erupted in the centre of Paris, that is another conversation for another day,” one commentator on the situation told the Evening Standard. Meanwhile, the London Mayor does nothing. The Metropolitan Police have been neutered by Mr. Khan’s laissez faire attitude, and are not allowed to ‘stop and search’ anymore by the Labour mayor. The killings continue daily.. Tourist advice: Don’t come to London. ",1
"E xcited about the World Cup? You should be. It’s a four week fiesta of football where most of – not all, there are several big name players who won’t be involved in the tournament, because of injury or due to their nation’s failure to qualify – the world’s best will be strutting their stuff. The best part? Discovering ‘new’ stars or players who take the tournament by storm. There are always a few in every World Cup – those players who we already know about but who step up with a string of exciting performances. So, with all due respect to established greats such as Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, here are six players worth keeping an eye on this summer. Timo Werner – Germany Look out for Werner in this World Cup. He’s got a crucial role to play for defending champions Germany, who are, not surprisingly, among the bookies’ favourites to win again. If they do triumph on July 15, they’ll surely need Werner’s goals. With Miroslav Klose long retired and Mario Gomez now 32, Werner is Germany’s new big goalscoring hope. He’s still quite the novice in terms of international football but the 22-year-old Leipzig striker scored seven goals in his first 13 caps – a fast and impressive start. Antoine Griezmann – France Not exactly a bright young prospect – Griezmann turned 27 this year so he’s in his prime – but this is a big tournament for the Frenchman. Actually, it’s going to be a big couple of months. For starters, his club future has been the subject of wild speculation, with a move from Atletico Madrid to Barcelona strongly tipped. It could be a career-defining transfer for Griezmann. In the tournament, there will be a massive focus on him. In the 2014 World Cup, he featured in five matches but failed to score. This time, according to the odds, he should be contention to be 2018’s top scorer. Can he deliver on his promise? Hirving Lozano – Mexico This lad could be something very special indeed. He might not be widely known outside of Mexico or the Netherlands – where he plays his club football, for PSV Eindhoven – but that’s going to change over the next few weeks. Lozano is a goalscoring winger who can play on the right or left, and his single season with PSV was a huge success. He scored 17 goals in 29 games for the Eredivisie club, and his return of seven in his first 27 caps for Mexico is pretty decent. PSV won’t want to sell him but if they do, they can expect a healthy mark-up on the £7m they paid for him in 2017. Paulo Dybala – Argentina There are other players in Argentina’s squad besides Messi and despite the never-ending coverage surrounding the Barcelona superstar, the South Americans have a lot of other talented footballers in their ranks. Indeed, if Argentina are going to win a first World Cup since 1986, Messi won’t be able to do it all on his own. Dybala is one of the strong supporting cast. He’s in that group of good players who aren’t quite in the top bracket – yet. A versatile striker – he can play as a centre-forward or just behind – his international career hasn’t really got going; he hadn’t scored for Argentina in 12 appearances when the squad was finalised. Time to break his duck? Aleksandar Mitrovic – Serbia Something of a leftfield choice, perhaps, but Mitrovic will be a pivotal figure in Serbia’s campaign. Not only that, he’s box office viewing. When he plays, don’t take your eyes off him. He’s just as likely to pull a goal from nowhere as he is to do something reckless; at his worst he can be hot-headed. But at this best, he’s a powerful, influential centre-forward. And his goalscoring record at this level has to be respected, with 13 goals in his first 36 caps. It’s easy to forget that he’s still only 23, with his best years ahead of him. Gabriel Jesus – Brazil Want to feel old? Jesus was only 17 at the time of the last World Cup – fast forward four years and he’s part of a dazzling Brazil forward line. He might be the junior member of the squad but don’t expect the Manchester City striker to be there simply to make up the numbers; he captained the team in a recent friendly. His scoring record for Brazil is impressive too – his first 16 caps yielded nine goals. He may yet upstage senior colleagues Neymar and Roberto Firmino.",1
"All it takes is a few words, a few well chosen words can make or break people on Twitter. People have been arrested for words on Twitter, people have lost their jobs, people have been made social outcasts and ostracised…just from a few words. How can we rationalise this extreme power that a few well or not well chosen words can impact so highly on either yourself or others? There is no doubt that words have power, however when put in a certain spotlight, there is an almost exponential rise in the power of those words. Analysing the goldfish bowl prison of Twitter, it is a bacterial incubator of human brain farts, and people do say some silly things, including so-called celebrities. In this light, should people be accountable for such brain farts? Not necessarily… What is all this seriousness about? Are we not all creative, chaotic creatures flailing around in the cold hard digital blackness? If someone makes a brain fart, they somehow got their fingers to compute the brain fart and put it onto the public notice board of Twitter. That single brain fart is not and should not sum up a complete human being. We as humans have numerous facets, we have numerous levels to our being, and it is sad that many are judged just for one singular mistake, some little thought that came out wrong, or that proverbial brain fart that somehow leaked out onto the keyboard. Is this our future? A future where we cannot make mistakes? Not even once, are we allowed to transgress, or move in a diagonal off beat way? Maybe it is cultural Marxism that is now so pervasive it is intoxicating, and stepping out of line with the PC mono-culture, the Sovietized conformity where everyone speaks in the same way, everyone thinks in the same simplistic ways is the norm. Imagine a vast grey landscape and billions of grey people come marching along, singing the same bland song and wearing the same grey clothes. THIS is what the internet is turning into, where all the free-thinkers, the true creatives and the eccentrics of the world are whittled down into a morose grey dust. Without the dreamers, the creatives and the exuberant eccentric characters, everything is stale, joyless and bland. This is why we should celebrate the brain fart, we should celebrate the mistakes that people make, and any creative person knows, there are happy accidents we make that sometimes formulate themselves into big ideas, big solutions, and off centre thinking creating radical changes that impact the whole of humanity. Do not fire people for words, do not arrest them? This is a form of tyranny, a form of totalitarian nastiness that George Orwell warned about. We should all be able to express ourselves however wrong, abhorrent or offensive it may seem to one certain group, or another clique or a whole swathe of people. As an artist, if people are offended by your work, then you are doing something right. You have touched people, and this is what artists do. To evolve as humans, we must therefore diverge from what there is now. Mistakes should not be punished, because making mistakes in life is a profound tool for growth, of course, this runs into the ultimate cliche that we learn more from our mistakes than we do from our successes. This is why Roseanne, should never be fired for her words on Twitter. She has now had her show cancelled by the ABC network, and she made some mistakes, she mouthed off, but even though we may not agree with her, we should still defend her right to say what she said with our lives. Freedom of speech means protecting all speech, including anything that is deemed offensive, or off centre. Everything and everyone should be allowed to express themselves…because this is the only way humanity will truly grow…without that, there is only a one-sided view. What about double standards? It is apparently okay for a comedian on the American left to show off a decapitated head of a president, yet to make silly remarks about Planet of the Apes is not permissible. If this means a furious Michelle Obama demanding Roseanne’s cancellation directly to the boss of Disney, we ask ourselves, who has the power today in America? That being said, at the end of the day, in this age, should humans still be punishing other humans for something they have no control over — the colour of their skin they were born with? You are born this way, you cannot change it, you cannot change your race, your DNA or genome…so why punish people for something they cannot change? Man..it’s one big clusterfuck…",1
"Imagine such a shock to the system, a democratically elected government tries to appoint their own finance minister, only to have an EU lackey and traitor to Italy thwart the appointment. From there, it is a repeat of a story told many times by the EU. Once the democratically elected elements disintegrate, an EU technocrat is shoehorned into the post as prime minister to keep the EU house in order. There is definitely no democracy involved in this EU move, as the EU abhors any form of democracy, as can be seen by the Brexit imbroglio, a muddied field of shit that even the most hardened Glastonbury-goers would balk at. Unfortunately, this scenario is not a scene from some Hollywood film describing the destruction of the democratic process but just happened with the Italian quisling president Sergio Mattarella appointing former IMF goon, Carlo Cottarelli as the desired technocratic outcome to the post of PM despite a fairly elected democratic government wishing otherwise. All of this is valid proof that democracy does not and cannot exist in the European Union. After all, it is a body ruled completely by unelected officials, who many do not know the names, or what they do. As Jean claude Juncker, the EU president once said about British calls for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty: “Of course there will be transfers of sovereignty. But would I be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact?,” How about what Juncker said about the French referendum on the EU constitution: “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’,” This is why anyone who supports the EU is essentially anti-democratic, and does not view their own sovereignty with any value. As for the poor Italian voters, your vote does not obviously count for shit in your own country, and what the disgraceful EU really means is finally dawning on some of you. Un altro giorno triste per l’Italia…",1
"Former first lady, Michelle Obama today extolled the virtues of cockroach milk, a new superfood for the health conscious champagne socialist set. “This is lactose free amino-acid rich goodness all in one. Protein rich and yummy. I pour the cockroach milk over my cereal in the morning and have a few drops with my coffee,” Mrs Obama told Marie Claire magazine. In October, Michelle Obama will be featured in her own Netflix show to promote healthy eating to Americans. Said to be the superfood for the Millennial era, many are even harvesting their own Hawaiian Pacific Beetle cockroaches at home, then milking them daily to extract the gooey milk that holds protein crystals. Hannah Gutter, a democratic party worker from Los Angeles has even named her cockroach brood, consisting of 240 cockroaches which she houses in her tiny apartment she shares with her girlfriend. “I love my cockroaches, I even name them, like see the one with spot on its back, that’s Spot, and the other one over there mating, that’s Harvey. I hope he got consent.” Milking time Extracting the milk from a cockroach can be a tedious business, and it takes Hannah four hours a day, but it’s worth every minute, in her point of view. “You pick them up one by one, then I rub their crotch area gently slowly picking up the pace. When you hear this clicking agitated excited sound, you know they’re close to popping. That’s when they usually shoot their gooey milky load all over the place, so you have to catch it in a cup. Afterwards some of them get really sleepy, and I put them in a quiet place to sleep it off.”",1
"The EU, is a soviet entity obsessed by regulations. They have regulation departments creating regulations for other regulations departments in a never ending circle of ridiculous regulations like the GDPR. Toothbrushes in the EU have 230,000 regulations, pillows have 456,000 regulations, and toilet seats have 763,000. Everything has over 50,000 regulations, and they keep coming month after month. Of course, the Daily Squib understands about users privacy etc…however, there are easier ways about doing things than this. You cannot sneeze or take a shit in the EU without being bogged down by EU regulations. This is why it is hell living in a Stasi fuck hole like the EU, an authoritarian piss factory governed by faceless unelected bureaucrats and their penchant for fucking red tape, regulations and huge expense accounts. The internet used to be a free land of creativity, of opportunity, of sharing and most of all free from restrictive government regulations. GDPR Who the fuck are the EU anyway to tell the whole internet and globe what to do? This is a massive overreach on the part of the EU, and the U.S. should tell them to piss off. Balkanising the internet Who rules the internet, the EU? Already, many news organisations across the pond have decided it is easier to block 500 million people than to comply with the EU’s ridiculous nonsense. This is obviously just about power for the EU and nothing else, it is just stating to the world that it has carte blanche to issue communistic diktats to everyone, without reproach. Priests have even stopped praying in church because of the EU ruling. Shutting down EU operations however does not protect web companies because the EU law applies to to EU citizens wherever they are in the world, therefore these websites that have shut out EU users within the EU can still be punished by the EU. GDPR will also impact on internet security according to experts, allowing criminals to get away with fraud and cryptojacking. £20 million fines The EU will fine companies £20 million or 4% of their yearly earnings if found breaching GDPR rules. The funny thing is, the EU will take the money from the fines itself. These new regulations are meant to protect the consumer, however the consumer who has been supposedly wronged gets nothing. Nice money maker for the EU…",1
"Manufacturers of the newly unveiled robot called Amazos claim that it can make you billions of dollars in revenue per annum and grow a massive global business empire exponentially. “All you do is give it a $1000 to start with. That’s it. You can now sit back and watch the magic as the robot’s entrepreneurial skills are put to full effect,” CEO Mulrone Etchington, told members of the audience at a recent talk in Salt Lake City, where the company is based. Customers should also be aware however that riches don’t come instantaneously. Like any business, Amazos may take some time to build up the business infrastructure, to reinvest, and to expand. “Our guarantee to you is that the Amazos android will make you into a billionaire in less than six years. Yes, you got that right. And not only that, this beautiful machine does not even need to take a piss, eat food, have sex, get grumpy, sleep or have a day off,” the CEO added. The Amazos concept was patented in 2015. Mass manufacturing of the product will begin in 2023. There are still no plans to unveil the cost of owning one of these robots. The intricate AI system leads Amazos to make key business decisions, innovate, invest, market, and is also ruthless with staff.

"The globe is on the cusp of a large future technological event that will change everything about how we as humans live on this planet. This massive shift into a new epoch of technological advancement will be akin to the Industrial era of the 19th Century in Europe. In essence, the changes that will be incorporated will have vast significant repercussions but will essentially be a huge leap forward. The technology that will change humanity forever is something that many will be scared by at first. Much of the biological body is not necessary, and humans have hardly evolved in thousands of years. We are still adapted to an existence thousands of years in the past. Future technological advances will thus incorporate nano machines within the body. There will not be any need to eat or breathe as microscopic machines sustain us from the inside. Backing-up your computer hard drive is a necessity, and it is incomprehensible that the human mind cannot be backed-up today. How many great scientific, artistic, literate minds have been lost so far? The future will ensure this never happens again, and we will be able to back-up our minds in full. Medical science is still in the stone age, even though some are trying to move forward, possibly ahead of their time. To augment, to enhance, to evolve. This is why brain implantation technology will revolutionise humanity in a huge leap in evolution. To begin first though, scientists will have to map out every dendrite, every neuron, every synapse and axon — a task that is enormous considering the fact that every human brain is different and unique. Coupled with advancements in robotics, and artificial intelligence, humans will be able to formulate new ways of transport, and a new understanding of our universal standing. Creating sentient beings that will be able to design, adjust and build other sentient beings will be the ultimate step towards a future that will enable earthlings to colonise new worlds across the universe. This is why science and technology must be funded to the highest levels now, why we must put all of our efforts into making that evolutionary leap forward. The future need not be a Brave New World, but one of ultimate technological creativity, of limitless possibilities encouraged to the full and not encased in moral boundaries and legal limitations. Enhancing humans, amalgamating with machinery is the future, and from there all the current problems of humanity can be solved. Some may say that conquering death through technology is a loss of humanity and soul, this is where they are wrong because everything in this universe has its own vibration, and a reason for existence.",1
"hoc est bellum Prince Harry, the ultimate royal lad who loves the rugby and general laddery is doomed to a marriage without fun and games as Meghan Markle reveals she is a social justice warrior feminist. There will be no more rugby games, or footie, just indoctrination into the pseudo-Marxist SJW race-baiting agenda by his new mullato wife, who is a member of BLM and undoubtably has a very large chip on her shoulder, ready to trigger the race card at any moment. Colonial artefacts purged from Queen’s palaces The new member of the royal family, Meghan Markle also wants anything that shows Britain’s colonial past to be scrapped, including the Crown Jewels which have diamonds seized from former colony, India. “I have been to Balmoral, and the Tower of London where the Queen keeps her Crown jewels. These are remnants of an Imperial colonial time in which Britain stole from countries and gave nothing back. I will make it my mission to change the royal family forever, and will demand they repatriate all of these stolen items to their former homes,” Markle shouted decisively at a courtier today. The IQ challenged Prince realised the mistake he has made only today, after he was brutally scolded for watching highlights of the FA Cup final on telly. His American bride does not condone any form of laddish behaviour and to see the prince sitting on the sofa with a beer in his hand watching the match re-run infuriated her SJW Marxist feminist sensibilities. Any form of sport, is deemed as masculine and against emasculating feminine sensibilities. “Everywhere I go in these palaces, all I see are antiquities and jewellery stolen from colonial lands. I am disgusted by it all. Also, there will be no hunting. I understand the royals like to hunt animals. I will put my foot down and disallow them from carrying on with it, and if they don’t stop I will be on the phone to PETA (an American organisation against animal cruelty),” Markle added. There will thus be no more hijinks and laddery from poor old Prince Harry, who has now been consigned to the mortuary slab of politically correct SJW death after marrying the American whose sole agenda is to castrate the royal family, and change them into something they definitely are not. Goodbye Prince Harry, alas, we knew him well.",1
"To see the looks on the faces of the members of the royal family when Chicago Blues Brothers African American Bishop, Michael Curry went on, and on, and on, and on, and on…was a picture in itself. “They were visibly shrinking in their seats as this chap proselytised about how this was a victory for race relations and babbled mumbo jumbo about Solomon, Martin Luther King, fire (the spread of Africans into Europe thousands of years ago) and love. It was a total amusing embarrassment to everyone, including black people, as this guy basically took over everything and pushed the race card down peoples’ throats proclaiming some sort of racial success over whitey. This was an Al Sharpton wet dream come true. First off, Meghan is a mulatto, she is not even full black. If she was, Harry would not be seen five hundred yards near her. These idiots think things have changed. It is hundred percent certain that behind safe closed doors they certainly have not, especially when it comes to the royals,” one of the revellers at the after wedding party revealed. These were all exotic curiosities The Bishop, would have even made James Brown cringe at his virtue signalling racist display, because all he was doing was saying that blacks had now infiltrated the pure bloods, and that black supremacy was well on the way to becoming a reality. Nothing has changed What these people do not understand is that humans today, especially the royal family, are essentially the same as people who lived thousands of years ago, with the same foibles and discriminatory outlook. Nothing will ever change humanity, and its general makeup. Nothing. At least Princess Michael of Kent did not come wearing her little brooch this time, and showed some decorum.",1
"W hat is it about numbers, they’re so fiddly, either they dictate you’re in the game or out of the game? Numbers come up in everything we do, whether it’s the lottery ticket you bought last night, or that pesky bill that dropped on your welcome mat this morning. Numbers can dictate whether you get that A grade or just a plain old B in your Chemistry exam, and numbers can dictate whether your favourite football team gets that much needed win. From the Ancient Sumerians who invented most of the mathematics we use today, or the Ancient Greek mathematicians like Pythagoras, humanity’s understanding of numbers is a constantly evolving quantum ladder of infinite numerical madness. Lest we forget about the significance of the correlation of words and numbers, with Gemetria, an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric code or cipher that assigns numerical value to a word, name, or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other. A single word can yield multiple values depending on the system used. In Hebrew gematria the word chai (alive), is composed of two letters that add up to eighteen. This has made eighteen a “lucky number” among the Jewish people. Gifts of money in multiples of eighteen are very popular. So, what makes a number particularly favourable? Again, this is purely subjective and random as well? You may say the number seven is your lucky number. Why? Well in your own personal view it is a number that comes up a lot, and it works for you. There are cultural differences, nuances to favourable and unfavourable numbers. In Chinese buildings the number four, thirteen, and fourteen are always omitted because they are considered unlucky, especially as the Cantonese word for four sounds like the word for ‘death’. If you live in London, you know for certain that if you’re waiting for a bus for forty minutes in the freezing rain, you will often get three buses all come at the same time, that’s just ‘sod’s law’ but it does make you think about numbers all the same. After your third wife and divorce, is number four going to be much of the same? Should you eat that second cream cake or go that extra ten miles on the exercise bike? Music is dictated by numbers. Check out that George Clinton Parliament groove on P-Funk that comes down on the three. Is there funk after death? Seven Up! Bach, of course is the king of numbers, as his compositions read like a mathematical maze of supreme universal symmetrical order. Sean Connery, an avid casino goer always betted on the number seventeen on the roulette table. One can almost picture the scene in the Casino de la Vallee in Saint-Vincent, Italy, in 1963, when Connery won on the number seventeen three times in a row. No doubt, for the best Bond actor, this was 007 melting into a real-life scenario. The odds for him to pull off that win were 1:50653, picking up a cool 17 million lire in winnings. Everything is about numbers, and if that certain lucky one turns up giving you a win it makes those endorphins rush through your system. In the world of games, casinos, computer games, lotteries, and life, then you will be counting on that certain number for the rest of your life. In a recent survey conducted by Betway Casino, the UK’s luckiest numbers were revealed, providing insight into which numbers bring people in Britain the most good fortune in their lives. The survey asked more than 2,000 members of the British public about their numerical superstitions. Results here. Remember folks, it’s all a numbers game, whatever you’re doing.",1
"Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knackers yard The Remainer PM, Theresa May, who could not negotiate her way out of a paper bag, is a lacklustre wet drip with no fucking balls or desire to free Britain from the octopus grip of the EU with a real Brexit as voted by the people. Mrs. May has again capitulated for the umpteenth time to demands from not only the EU but now Ireland, an EU controlled country now led by an Indian homosexual PM, who prefers picking pansies in his boutique garden to making any sort of common sense negotiations. Thanks to the Remainer insipid PM, Britain is now tied to the EU for god knows how long with the so-called Customs-Union and Single Market. This means that International trade deals are now postponed indefinitely, and the whole premise of Brexit is non-existent. You can hear the traitorous Remainers on big bank busting EU pension plans and Brussels handouts laughing joyously as Britain is sold down the river once again, the people trodden on, democracy now a long distant memory. For these people, these traitors, these vile scum sucking Remainers who willingly wipe their arses on the British flag for money and hatred of their own nation, this is a definite win for them. What this means is that the ‘will of the people’ means nothing in Britain today. Democracy does not exist in Britain. All those promises before the EU Referendum that the vote would be final, would be legally binding and a true measure of the democratic will of the people — it was all a big fucking lie. The people have been lied to, dragged through the dirt, their vote usurped, spit on and defiled. The sovereign right for Britain to rule itself, make its own rules, make its own trade deals on its own terms, control its own borders, are all a dream of the past. For thousands of years these islands have always made their own destiny, but today that is all gone, we as an island are now ruled comprehensively by others from foreign lands who are milking us monetarily and do not care one fig about us. Britain is effectively a beaten country, ruled by traitors, sold off for the lowest price to foreign powers for a pittance. Remainers spit on the graves of those who died in the two great wars to bring Britain freedom. They scowl at the graves, pull down their trousers and literally shit on the graves of those soldiers who gave their lives for Britain. Remainers are the evil face of pure hatred and greed, their avarice fuelled by unelected members of the EU Commission and their handouts in brown envelopes delivered to these quisling Remainers in dark back alleys. Lord Haw Haw would be proud today at Remainers and the House of Lords, who betrayed Britain, sold us off to the enemy with no fucking way of getting out. And all of this happened under the gaze of so-called Brexiteers in Cabinet and parliament. Brexiteers, who were meant to defend democracy, and the will of the people yet did nothing…they were impotent. They postulated of course, we will do this, we will do that, but they had no fucking balls to do anything, too afraid of losing their positions in government or parliament. Not one of them stood up for Britain, there was no sacrificial Charge of the Light Brigade cry as they ran towards the enemy, they just stood by and watched, powerless, creatures with not one single fucking bollock between them, a vomitous menage of losers, braced with yellow piss coloured cowardice. One must therefore assume the so-called Brexiteers in parliament are in cahoots with the Remainers, that is the only conclusion to come to, and it is a sad detrimental conclusion that ultimately reveals the truth about this whole Brexit farce. Fuck You No one should dictate to Britain what it can and cannot do. Britain dictates to others, not the other way round. Ireland and its demands are thus rendered impotent, because Ireland is a land ruled by the EU, they are a beaten country, a land which has already been conclusively beaten and defeated by Brussels. Fuck you. You are now worthless, you are not Ireland anymore, you are something else, you are lower than dirt, a defeated people with no self worth or national pride. Build a 200 ft high steel wall across the infected border with Northern Ireland, man it with turrets and electric fences to make a successful Brexit. If it means this, let it be, to free Britain from the EU, without loss of territory — let it be. It can, and SHOULD be done.",1
"Russell Brand is no stranger to shocking behaviour The recent Russell Brand appearance on Loose Women has caused outrage in royal circles as well as the general public. Speaking freely during the television show Loose Women, Russell Brand revealed that Meghan Markle was part of the cast for the film he was in called ‘Take me up the Greek’. “Not only was she in the film cast, but I was in her too after the scene in me lil caravanny thingy wingy. That prince ‘arry is a lucky bloke. I took her up the Greek.” the 42-year-old actor stated when asked if it was true he shagged Markle, 36, during an appearance on the ITV show Loose Women Wednesday. Paradigm Shit Palace courtiers were not too happy with Russell Brand after the show aired but have kept a stony dignified silence over the whole affair. There is speculation however that not only is Prince Harry not happy about Brand’s declaration but Prince Philip literally blew off his colostomy bag upon hearing the news. The Forgetting Sarah Marshall star, who portrayed rocker Aldous Snow in the 2010 flop, went on to imitate someone objecting to Meghan’s and Prince Harry‘s highly-anticipated royal wedding on Saturday. “Meghan Markle, there we go. ‘If anyone has any reason …’” teased Brand before adding, “Yeah! Russell Brand snogged her in a film, then took her up the Greek afterwards!’ Never mind her bloody dad selling photos!” he said referring to the news that Markle’s dad participated in staged paparazzi photos. Members of the public were not too happy about Brand’s words either. Some even suggested the Queen condemns Brand to the Tower where he is ‘taken up the Greek’ by a big burly Beefeater, then his head ‘chopped orf’ for posterity’s sake, and unceremoniously displayed on a spike at Traitor’s Gate.",1
"With the sad meanderings of Meghan Markle’s ailing father and family, as well as the announcement today that he will not be presenting his daughter to the prince at the royal wedding on Saturday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump has stepped in. “I have been following the news and have spoken to the prince and Meghan. It would be an honour for me to walk the soon-to-be princess down the church aisle,” President Trump said from the White House. Donald Trump, ever the diplomat, has recently been persuading Kim Jong-un to drop his nuclear armaments, that is until that John Bolton idiot stuck his fat nose into everything and fucked it all up. Nevertheless, with all this toing and froing, the president will find the wedding a calm interlude to his otherwise busy schedule. It is not a certainty that Melania will attend as she herself has recently undergone surgery and is recovering. White House aides are also considering a surprise visit to Windsor on the wedding day, unannounced. I don’t like to see beautiful women in distress. Instead, I just grab ’em, grab ’em by the … Jerry Fleischer, senior White House organiser told CNN: “What better wedding present for the royal couple than the U.S. president landing on the Windsor castle lawn in Marine One.” As there will be no catering or food at the royal reception, there will not be any need for an extra plate for Donald Trump when he turns up out of the blue.",1
"Health Minister Oly Ilunga late Wednesday said two suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever were reported in the Wangata health zones, which includes Mbandaka city, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Bikoro, the rural area where the outbreak began. He said one sample proved positive for the deadly Ebola virus. Ilunga said Congo now is entering an urban phase of the outbreak, with higher spread potential. He said epidemiologists are working to identify additional contacts to the 500 already identified. Lessons not learned One would have thought the people and authorities in Congo would have learned that the eating of bushmeat is a cause of the spread of Ebola, but many have not heeded any warnings. Bushmeat is still a staple diet of many Africans, even though there is solid scientific evidence proving that deadly pathogens are spread into the human population from ingesting bushmeat. In the Congo, bushmeat consists of monkeys, crocodiles, antelope, snakes, gorillas and bats. Bats carry highly infectious pathogens and are one of the primary causes of the spread of Ebola. Bushmeat is considered an African delicacy Photo: C. Stanley/Flickr With international travel, and a steady flow of traffic from the Congo to Europe and other destinations, it is only a matter of time until the spread of any infectious tropical virus like Ebola spreads. The symptoms are not seen for some time once infected, 21 days is the usual incubation period. This is why it is easy to take a flight to Paris, France from the Congo with no problems. During the flight, the infected passenger may infect many more passengers simply through a sneeze or cough. Water droplets carry the virus with little effort, and the victim ingests the droplets either through the nasal passage, mouth or even pores in the skin. Thanks to the EU Schengen zone, the spread of Ebola throughout the European peninsula would be quite quick unless contained early. Already, many illegal migrants from Congo, Eritrea, and other parts of Africa make their way towards the crossing from Libya onto Italy. It is safe to say that Italy would become ground zero during a major Ebola outbreak as the number of migrants making the treacherous crossing in boats is rising daily. The Ebola virus is transmitted by bodily fluids, and even after being cured, the virus exists in semen for three months, therefore it can be transmitted far and wide. Death from Ebola is usually extremely painful as the internal organs are eaten away and massive internal bleeding occurs shutting down the whole system.",1
"Russian ultras are getting ready for England fans for the World Cup in Russia this summer. No one in their right mind should go to Russia, especially after what happened at the Euro 2016 football hooligan event in Marseilles. Russian Ultras do not drink alcohol before fighting events and are highly trained in fighting arts like Krav Maga, Russian Systema and other Spetsnaz fighting techniques. Backed directly by Putin’s Kremlin, Russian Ultras are also highly organised during fighting sessions, overwhelming their opponents, then taking them down clinically, and brutalising them mercilessly even when down on the ground helpless. Russian Ultras wear all black clothing, black hats and have specific legions, they meticulously plan their attacks utilising maps before each football event. They mark out areas where they will flank their opponents, planning strafing attacks as well as where they can corner their opponents and beat them senseless. England fans have many major weaknesses, they are unorganised, untrained, and are usually drunk. These qualities are capitalised on by the Russians who utilise military techniques, and the fact that English fans are drunk and disorganised to maximum effect. The Russians will be fully sober of alcohol, although on amphetamines, and pure adrenaline. Not only do the Russian Ultras have highly advanced attack formations and plans, but they also utilise sophisticated techniques to avoid any police contact. This means they can inflict as much damage as possible on England fans without reproach or fear of getting caught. Usually, this means many England fans are caught unaware, as the Russians appear out of nowhere and smash their opponents with ultimate brutality and no mercy, then swiftly dissapear. It is certainly interesting that the Home Office has not called off the World Cup in Russia this summer for England fans, as they will be prime targets, especially after the recent Novichock chemical attack in Salisbury. It is safe to say, therefore that England fans will be sitting ducks during the Russian World Cup and their lives will be in serious danger. The heavily trained Russian Ultras have been training hard in the gym and their special training camps for this specific event all year. The Russian Ultra creed this summer is to show its superiority, and brutal might over the drunk, fat, untrained English fans and if any England fans actually go to the Russian World Cup, they might just as well be coming back in a body bag.",1
"W hen we think about the world of online gambling, we can think that this is a bit of a shady industry. However, the UK Gambling Commission, UKGC for short, are tackling bad practice in the industry in order to make it a safer practice for players. Recently, we’ve seen some massive fines coming into play from this governing body. LeoVegas and Self-Exclusion Over the last few months, there have been a lot of fines handed down for a variety of different reasons. LeoVegas, one of the larger operators out there, have been fined because of their practices around self-exclusion. So what exactly does this mean? Self-exclusion is a very valuable tool for players that have identified that they may have a gambling addiction. This allows them to put stops in place, effectively suspending their account for a set period of time. This can be temporary, for a month, or permanent – depending on what the player feels is appropriate. During this time, the operator has some serious obligations to the player. They have to treat this player differently, as they have flagged that they have an issue with gambling. Problem gambling is a serious issue and one that operators have to respect and stamp out where possible. This means that they can’t communicate with the player to offer them promotions or attempt to have them coming back before their exclusionary period is up. The failings of LeoVegas include marketing to these excluded players, allowing them to gamble and not taking reasonable steps to support them. They were also found to be running ads that were deemed to be misleading. These were misleading due to extensive terms that were not represented or claims that were embellished. The result of this ruling was a £627,000 fine for the entertainment site, which was deemed to be the rough amount of profit accrued due to these business practices. 888’s £7.8million Fine One of the largest fines that we’ve ever seen handed down by the UKGC is the £7.8million bill delivered to 888. This was on similar grounds to the previous one levied against LeoVegas, for failings relating to self-exclusion. As a much larger operator, it makes sense that they have a much bigger fine to pay. More than 7000 of their excluded players were impacted by these failings. These players were still able to access their account and place bets, even after submitting their desire to exclude. This is a serious flaw within the self-exclusion system and for such a large operator it’s not an acceptable flaw to have. From there, it was also found that one of their players was able to place bets amounting to £1.3million without any form of checks. Operators are responsible for checking in on players spending habits, to ensure that they are playing with their own money and in a responsible fashion. This player had actually stolen this money from their employer and potential action from 888 could have mitigated this. The money that has been fined by the UKGC was found to be the profits from these players and will be used to fund problem gambling charities. 888 are now working with the government body to produce a sturdier self-exclusion system going forward. Systematic Failures from William Hill Another big name operator, William Hill, has also been fined over the course of the last year. They have been fined a total of £6.2million because of what the UKGC are calling ‘systematic failures’. Money laundering is a serious concern for operators, as they have a responsibility to know their players to prevent this from happening. Online gambling can be a funnel for those looking to launder money from illegal activities. As the money paid in and out of online gambling sites can be volatile, it’s an easy way to move cash around from illegal activities. The onus is on the operator to be able to assess where the money is coming from and identifying players to investigate further. Ten of their customers were able to deposit over £1.2million, which was later found to be linked to criminal activity. This was deemed to be unacceptable by the UKGC, as they effectively allowed these illegal funds to be legitimised through their platform. In their eyes, William Hill should have taken steps to query where these funds were coming from on such high stakes wagers. Next Steps for the UK Gambling Industry This seems to be indicative of an overall trend within the industry, as more operators are taken to task over these issues. Socially responsible operators like Lucky Admiral are paving the way by taking steps to ensure that they are compliant. For many operators, it makes sense to attempt to create this kind of safety net by taking their own steps to be better, rather than waiting for a fine to be handed down. In the wake of GDPR, these sites will also have to think about how they handle player data too. This is a massive undertaking for any gambling site, as they potentially have millions of player profiles. It can also be somewhat contradictory with the rights of self-excluded players. Although they can ask for their data to be removed, operators would still have to retain enough information to prevent them from gambling with them again. We’ve also seen a lot of emphasis placed on underage gambling. These underage players can also be failed by the system, as they should be assessed prior to being able to gamble. This includes ID checks and flagging up fraudulent information. We’re also seeing a sizeable reduction in the number of sites using cartoon mascots, as these have also been deemed by the CAP as attractive to underage gamblers. We may see more fines on the way for sites that aren’t placing enough checks for these players. The UK gambling market is becoming tougher for operators, as the UKGC proposes more rules and regulations. It seems that conscious operators will be able to change their processes to stay compliant, those that don’t will be at risk of a fine.",1
"The future does not need us humans, and sometimes this feeling gets closer and closer to reality. Hail, the age of the robots is upon us. Watching the latest robots from Boston Dynamics (a former Google owned company) and the uncanny human movements they have acquired will truly make the hairs on your neck stand up. The incredible technology is so advanced that this company has truly excelled beyond any other research development company on earth today. Every day is one small step towards the Kurzweil Singularity, and one can imagine this coupled with advanced AI, and we have the recipe right there. “I saw these robots and I shrunk into myself. It’s truly uncanny, scary to see such machine robots jumping and running around as if they were human or some kind of devilish animal. I can’t help thinking of these robots tracking humans down, their onboard weapons aided by heat seeking vision,” a man said after seeing the videos. Could we all be walking towards a dystopian robot nightmare or will these robots serve humans obediently? That is the question many ask, and it is certainly a pertinent question to be ruminating over. Imagine running through a dark forest being chased by twenty of these things. You are out of breath but they never tire, you are fearful, but they have no feelings as they close in on you, their metal fangs and red eyes glow in the dark. You trip over a tree stump, their night vision allows them to jump over it with ease, until you are cornered, out of breath, the last thing you hear is the whirring motors as the pack rips you apart, limb from limb.",1
"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are soon to be wed, and as Meghan has met the Windsor family already, it was Prince Harry’s turn to meet the soon to be in-laws. The prince travelled to deepest Montana three weeks ago to meet some members of the Markle clan and Doobey clan, as well as their extended family. Speaking on an ITV exclusive, the prince was truly humbled after meeting some of the family. Welcome to the family “At one point one of them took out a vintage blunderbuss and shot a trespasser (photographer) on their land clean dead. It was quite a mess,” Prince Harry recalled jocularly. Living in a shack were the cousins from the Doobey and Markle family. Uncle Buck Doobey, 65, is a wanted felon in seven states and was convicted for illegal moonshine production in 2016. He is also an alleged sheep rapist, and is to be tried in the county court in two weeks time. Delores Markle, 42, sold her story to a New York tabloid for a six figure sum, and spilled the beans about ‘Pushy Princess Meghan’. She is set to buy a pig pen on her property with the funds she received. “Imma raise some pigs to get me rich and fat. This shit is owed to me. Hyuk!” Delores Markle, 42, points a gun at a photographer at her Montana property Enus Doobey, 28, has been in and out of prison all his short life, and is currently on the run for credit card fraud, meth dealing as well as robbing seven banks unsuccessfully in four states. “They’s told me that I might get an invite to Meghan’s wedding where they gots lots of silver and jewels and shiet. Unfortunately it never arrived in the mail. Imma have to catch that goddamn mailman next time I see the sumbitch!” Living in a shack where most of the windows are broken, there is no running water, but there’s plenty of beer and meth. “We live well here. Never worked a day in my life. Last time I saw Meg in L.A. we got on like a house on fire, that is I burned down her pa’s kitchen after a meth cooking experiment went wrong.” Enus Doobey, relaxes in his kitchen while his father Buck drinks some home made beer All in all, Prince Harry had a pleasant time on his visit to see the future in-laws, and at one point took part in a competition to see who could spit tobacco furthest. The ITV special on the royal visit will air in July.",1
"The military contract named Project Maven which teaches machine learning AI to killer drones over countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan is now a part of the Google roster of contracts. It is most certainly the brainchild of Eric Schmidt who now is working full-time for the Pentagon after leaving Google as CEO. Don’t be evil One employee said: “I joined Google because they said they weren’t evil, well, that shit did not work out. The mass censorship of alternative media, global search monopoly, authoritarian control of search results to skew public opinion, leftist agendas and now a military contract helping drones blow up brown people living in countries we hate because they’re not American or Christian. It was the last straw. Like, yesterday, I was ordered to clean up Sundar Pichai’s hole in the floor toilet in his office. He’s Indian and cannot stand Western toilets. He does not even use toilet paper but uses his bare left had to wipe like a good Indian, sometimes he forgets to wash his left hand. Indians use their naked left hand to wipe their asses and their right to eat with. Can you imagine the bugs he’s spreading at the canteen during lunch? Like what the fuck? I refused and walked out.” Whether Indian Google CEO Sundar Pichai uses his country’s customs is not the point here however, and the main issue is about Project Maven and its erroneous uses to murder unwitting people by American drones. Unfortunately many civilians die during these U.S. drone strikes, and in one instance 41 men were targeted, but 1,147 innocent civilians were killed. Ethically, apart from the massive censorship that Google doles out, as well as its dislike of satire, possibly because it just does not understand it, there is a serious ethical question to Google’s participation in the Pentagon’s Project Maven. Meanwhile, thousands of tech experts are resigning from Google because of this particular ethical question.",1
"President Donald J. Trump today hailed another mission accomplished after the successful opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem. “The Israelis only killed 98 Palestinians during the opening ceremony. That’s quite a success in my eyes because there were thousands of these indigenous shitheads around. I’m actually surprised the number of deaths was not higher.” Trump’s beautiful daughter, Ivanka, stood by the plaque for the new embassy as arms flailed in the air, at one point she was hit by a dismembered foot but her smile did not flinch at any point during the opening ceremony. A bystander who lost both legs during the American embassy opening ceremony was okay about it, and just notched it under slight bad luck. “I was standing in the crowd clapping when the bullets started flying and IDF soldiers told us to disperse. I held up my invitation slip but the soldier unloaded a magazine or three of bullets into my legs practically disintegrating them. I’m thankful I got to keep my scrotum although the rest is all gone. Oh well, I’m happy about the U.S. embassy and wish many more years of fun and games,” Lionel Majinski, recalled from his Jerusalem hospital bed. Jerusalem officials have revealed it may take a few days to wash away the blood and dismembered body parts from around the embassy and other areas but other than that everything worked like clockwork on the day.",1
"The soon to be wedded couple are said to have their eye on the Hawaiian island of kilauea for their multimillion pound taxpayer funded honeymoon. Royal commentator Bartholomew Bentwick, revealed the news in the latest edition of Hello magazine. “The prince likes volcanoes because they are dangerous much like marrying a ‘dime princess’ a la Wally Simpson. Meghan is certainly not a 19th century ‘dollar princess‘ the debt-ridden royals welcomed so eagerly to bolster their coffers and heat their palaces back in the day.” Staying at the Leilani Estates 5 star hotel, the royal couple will get a first hand look at the lava as it flows decisively across the immaculate gardens towards the hotel. Prince Harry has refused to sign a pre-nup before the wedding and is most certainly to get a short sharp eruption of his own in a few years time. “Prince Harry is used to different women every day. They are served up to him daily in secrecy of course, but there’s no way he will be able to cope with one piece of pussy for the rest of his life. It’s just impossible. Harry usually loses interest after a few hours. I mean if you can taste all of the different kinds, and not have any blowback, he will go positively insane after the first few months, and then there’s the babies, when the mother is with them it’s all over. This will certainly cause some friction for the fiery red haired gentleman, and his very clever wife, who will no doubt cry foul after finding out, cha ching!” one of Harry’s mates revealed candidly. As for marrying a commoner, these are never accepted by the aristocracy. Of course aristocrats are armed with friendly smiles and Meghan will not notice what is going on but Harry certainly will. This is why Hawaii is such a prescient honeymoon destination for the newlywed royal couple.",1
"A business that finds itself on the first or second page of the Google search results is likely to succeed than the one which finds itself on page 5 or 10. As such, having and maintaining a strong online presence is a key component to the success of a business; this task, however, does not come easy nor cheap. While it’s certain that you have to spend some money looking for a digital marketing agency, you can find solace in that there is an affordable digital marketing agency that offers cost-effective ways to market your business. Blogging One of the proven ways to keep in touch with your customers is through blogging. Different marketing agencies are capable of blogging focusing on any particular niche. Blogging can take many forms i.e. you can use the blog to promote new services or products, inform your customers about the benefits of your products, and use it as a platform to answer in detail to questions raised by your customers. In order to realise the maximum potential of a blog, you need to update the blog regularly meaning you need to establish a long-term relationship with a marketing agency. Invest in a strong social media presence Studies show that many people nowadays spend much of their time on social media channels rather than browsing company websites. This means you have a better chance of reaching more people using your business’ different social media handles than the business website itself. There are many social media platforms, each with its own pros and cons for different businesses. Facebook is perfect for businesses that want to send text and graphical messages to its customers in equal proportion. Twitter and LinkedIn are perfect for businesses that want to send text messages only to its customers while Instagram and Pinterest are perfect for businesses that want to show the graphical side mostly. Tap into the possibilities of YouTube and Flickr Social media channels mostly offer you the opportunity to send simple messages to your customers but these may not be enough. To attract many people, you need not just send out a simple text or image ad the summarises what your business has to offer but you may need to come up with videos that explain in detail what it is you can do for the customer. Sites such as YouTube and Flickr give you the room and platform to interact with customers while showing your work. The videos need not be too long, as that’s a turn off for some rather they should be short and concise touching on the most important parts. Types of videos that you can do depending on your line of business include explainer videos where you explain how your product works or how you provide your services, Q&A videos where you answer customer questions, and How to’s/Tutorials where you educate your customers on how to use your products.",1
"The prophesy the Daily Squib published in 2011 is slowly coming into fruition, as espoused by the venerable Henry Kissinger, possibly the greatest living statesman of modern times. Now that the future prophesy is becoming a reality we had to pick Henry’s brains just a little more to possibly see the real clincher in how the whole chess game will pan out. Once again we were afforded a brief interview with the elderly statesman in his grand Manhattan apartment, and after a long journey from London, England, we were greeted with the utmost hospitality from our host. Kissinger for his age looks remarkably well, of course he has the stoop, and lumbers over to an exquisite Louis XVI chair humming a jovial tune, but his mind is still a tour de force to be reckoned with. Kissinger’s nurse, Hilda, hands over some fine brandy, and we get started. Kissinger speaks with a gentle lulling voice. “In our last conversation I spoke of the key to war. This key is Iran, and its catalyst was Iraq and Syria. One must remember that a conflict with Iran is effectively a conflict with Russia and China, and soon they will enter the fray, as was prophesied. We, the United States have been baiting the Russians and Chinese for some time, and slowly they are getting the message. They will be forced to make their move sooner than later. The supreme land of Eretz Ha’Avot, our motherland, our home will fight with all its might now to cleanse the Middle East of threats to Israel. This is the time to cut out the tumour that has haunted us for so long, and Bibi, my protégé, will take no prisoners. Rest assured, I was on the phone to him yesterday during the Iranian attack on the Golan Heights.” I ask Kissinger, in the last conversation we had in 2011, he was quoted as saying “It is just that last stepping stone, i.e. Iran which will really tip the balance”. Why is Iran such a stepping stone for total global warfare? Kissinger pauses for a few seconds, then rasps quietly, yet forcibly. “The Persians are the ultimate prize in global hegemony. Once that line is crossed, then the onus and power play increases incrementally. The stepping stone to global domination ever closer for the United States. Iran is bolstered by Russia and China, and when we take that away from them, they will have less global power, they will have less global brinkmanship, they will see reduced global territorial influence in the region. This will cause them to make a move, because if they do not, then they are finished as well as the Iranians. “When General Wesley Clarke said that seven Middle Eastern countries were to be taken over, he was not joking or fooling around. This is the plan all along, and the internet is helping the spread of Western culture, Western ways, that these countries aspire to be like the West, especially when every day they see how we live very well in the West. Their poverty, their uncertain living standards, their constant state of war for them becomes unbearable. The people will also eventually revolt from the inside to dethrone the dictators. Look what happened in Libya, in Egypt and Tunisia, now in Yemen, and Syria, Iraq as well as the failed coup in Turkey. Hearts and minds first, then military.” I ask Dr. Kissinger about Obama’s style of presidency compared to Trump’s. You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs “Essentially one was the sweetener before the cup of coffee. Obama’s role, and he played it very well was to sweeten up the chumps, and to think they had one over us. Naturally, Obama did not know that was his role, and he naively believed he was doing the right thing. However, we would never give in so easily, and this is why we put Trump in. Once we had the sweetener, we put in the cup of war, the coffee, strong and military trained of course, as Trump is, he went to military academy and knows what is needed. He knows that business is war, war is business, and he also knows that to really finish the job, we must have total war or nothing will ever change. You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, thus meaning — for true change to come, we must first have some constructive destruction. The moment of truth will be beautiful to behold, because war is both things, it is ugly yet beautiful in what it can achieve.” Did Dr. Kissinger know about the EU army, and its preparations for war with Russia in 2011? I ask the esteemed gentleman that question. “Yes, of course I knew. Yes, Russia has always been a thorn in Europe’s side, and the recent incursion into Ukraine was a small but decisive move by Putin. Here is a man that I respect highly because he acts decisively, yet secretively, almost akin to a grandmaster in chess, but we will always outmanoeuvre him with our technology, our technique, and we will outmanoeuvre the Chins too. We shackled them with communism in the first place, therefore they have their hands tied behind their backs and are literally too blind to see straight with their restrictive ideology. The Russians however have gone from communism to authoritarianism and vast amounts of mafia corruption, I might add. The Russians are still in a post-Soviet stupor, they have still not found themselves. As for Europe, they are in a sclerotic state as the drums of war are beating ever faster and louder every day.” By this time, Kissinger is getting tired, his head lilts slightly forward, and some spittle drools onto his dressing gown. The nurse quickly applies a handkerchief to his jowls, and I am permitted the final question for the session. I ask Dr. Kissinger about the New World Order that will come after the purging is completed. What will that entail? “Most of it, I cannot talk about, and I may not live to even see it, however as one of its architects, I can reveal a few slivers of information. Essentially the NWO means singular. There can only be one winner over all of earth’s last remaining resources, and no other factions can exist. It also means a controlled population below 500 million where no other conflict will ever occur again. Invariably, the new technological society is in place now, because we have the technology and technique as we speak now, but the inherent problem is different factions, old ways of thinking and overpopulation. Of course, this is a very large topic, and I fear I have given away too much, but you do the math. If you survive into the next stage, you will be a truly esteemed member and honoured, illuminated fellow of the New World Order, but only if you survive.” It is with those last words, that Kissinger dismisses us, possibly for the last time. We leave him by the grand fireplace amongst his books and brandy. As I leave, I kick myself, as I did not ask him specifically how to survive through the next stage, but then remember the 2011 interview where he gave a few clues. Do you really have to be a billionaire to survive the next stage? I think to myself. Of course not, if you know how to survive, and are prepared, stocked up, anyone can do it, but you just have to get on with it as time really is running out. There are still many unanswered questions. I never asked about Trump’s supposed successes with North Korea, or about Brexit. Time was way too short, and I kick myself for only delving into a few topics. The trip back to London is hauntingly lonely.",1
"The outraged Obamas are to flee their Washington premises after Barack Hussein Obama’s legacy is in tatters thanks to President Donald Trump. “I remember that talk I did about Twitter nasty remarks, and how I said Donald Trump would never be president, and at least I was ‘a president’. It haunts me in my dreams now. Everywhere I look and hear the Donald, and he got me big time, not only did he become president, but in a short time he has done more than I ever did. My socialist Marxist dreams of a changed America are now in ruins as nearly all my efforts have been dismantled. And then he went and ruined the Iranian deal I made…I think I need to cry,” former president Obama told a recent reportage on CNN. Real estate company, Younir has confirmed the purchase of an apartment in the Sahebgharaniyeh district, Tehran by the Obamas. An upcoming high end residential area of the city where embassy staff and ministers own properties. To put into perspective the anger that emanates now from the Obamas, it’s way up there, over 170% over the boiling point. “Our family have purchased a property in Tehran, Iran where we will live. Our daughters will attend an Iranian university and are already taking lessons in Farsi,” Barack Obama later revealed. Michelle Obama and the two daughters are also getting used to wearing full head scarves as is required by women in public. “Michael, ahem, I mean Michelle, will be wearing a full head dress over her head. It’s like some Islamic custom that she is required to wear that in public,” one of the Obama aides revealed. The only problem is that in Iran homosexuality is punished with death, but of course that should not be any problem for Barack and Michelle Obama. ",1
"T he online gaming industry was launched a little over two decades ago and has moved to dethrone the brick and mortar business to become the dominant revenue generator. The wide web has successfully achieved reaching millions of gamblers by taking the location-based services to the gamer rather than having them look for the services. This convenience has been further accomplished through the introduction of mobile gaming. This platform allowed gamblers to enjoy the services of online gaming software developers and gambling destinations at the convenience of any location and a cheaper and less bulky situation than that of personal computers. On top of animating nearly all the sets found in land-based casinos, the platform has been able to replicate the experience of a location-based casino by providing live gaming platform. That way, players can enjoy live roulette UK, blackjack, poker, baccarat, and others in Realtime and with other gamblers. The success of the online gambling platform has catalysed the significant rise in gaming operators that are looking to satisfy the ever-growing online gambling fan base. Most of the sites that have been established have only accomplished half of what is required to run a business on the online platform. Below we look into the second part of this process, which is measuring the success of gaming operators in the United Kingdom. Use of Key Performance Indicators When it comes to being successful in the online gaming scene, or any other business for that matter, the marketing of products being provided plays a key role. Marketing not only involves getting clients to try out the product but also keep them coming back for more once they have. Different gaming entities have varying methods as to how they achieve this, but one that stands out among all of them is the provision of bonuses and promotions. In a bid to earn the loyalty of as many players as possible, casino operators end up spending a lot. With the amount of money pumped into the marketing venture, most gaming establishments would want to know how to measure whether they are achieving success or not, especially considering that the business exists on a virtual platform: this is where Key Performance Indicators, better known as KPIs, come in. Key Performance Indicators involve various algorithms that help casinos understand the relation between the gamblers they have and the money flowing in and out of their casino; the final figures are then used to measure success. The first important part of this algorithms is the Gross Gaming Revenue. This part helps tell the difference between the wagers placed on the provided games and the wins collected by gamblers. The amount generated varies from one time to the other considering that most casino games are dependent on luck; therefore, gamers may collect more wins some days and lose more on others. The reached value includes the bills to be paid by the gaming establishment. Once that is done, the Net Gaming Revenue comes in. This algorithm indicates the amount casino operators are left with after they have cleared out all the casino bills; these may range from one casino to the next, but the most popular ones include: Government taxes Cashier options charges Game developer fees Affiliates’ commissions License Charges Incentives provided to gamblers, etc. Net Gross Revenue can also be calculated to the amount of money cashed in by gamblers. The higher the value, the higher the success rate. However, the cashed in amount to wagers placed should not be high, or this would indicate that too much money is going back to the gamblers; this could most likely be in the form of bonuses and promotion offers. Gaming operators should also put into consideration the amount that is spent to draw in each gambler when measuring how successful they are. For instance, if ten thousand dollars were used when marketing the site through advertisements, which resulted in the acquisition of one hundred gamblers, each gamer cost the casino one hundred dollars. The casino should calculate to see whether each of these players brought in more than what was used to acquire them to see if the venture was a success. The KPIs can be used to measure success in terms of gamblers as well as cash. For instance, they can be used to calculate the number of gamers that created an account with the gaming establishment against those that actually paid the site a visit. Success comes in when the percentage acquired is high since it means a lot of them were interested in what they saw and spent some money; those that made the move to spend some money should be the key factor in this equation. Additionally, one can move on to evaluate how many gamblers stayed loyal to the gaming site against those that left after only a short while. Again, this percentage should be high to indicate success. Even those that come back should be measured according to the amount of time and money that they spend playing. Seeing from the number of KPIs that are involved in the measurement of success and the number of gamers that could visit a site, it can prove hard to keep track of everything manually. Various software programs are availed online to calculate the success rates and provide them when needed. Above all, gaming operators should be keen on providing client satisfaction above all for the success rate to be high at all times.",1
"Big Almaty lake In December. Kazakhstan. I had just finished exercising and went to the sauna. The gym I go to is a modern facility with new equipment and is very popular in our city. My favorite parts are the sauna and the steamer. Both remind me of my old country – Russia. Though, to be politically and geographically correct – I never lived in Russia: I was born and raised in one of the fifteen republics of the former USSR – the republic of Kazakhstan. So, I am a Russian from Kazakhstan. It’s kind of confusing for Americans, and when twenty-six years ago my American wife brought me here, the customs official gave me an alien card where my nationality was stated not Russian but Kazakh. My friends make fun of me, because Russians and Kazakhs are like apples and oranges. We look different… In 1992, when I arrived in America, the relationship between the two cold war rivals was excellent: Americans traveled to Russia, opening McDonalds, KFC’s, Burger Kings, and other businesses, and Russians were opening not only their hearts but even the secrets of the overthrown KGB. Millions of Russians and Americans enjoyed such a “romance” between the two most powerful nuclear countries in the world. Not anymore! Every morning I wake up to the words, “Russia is terrible,” and go to sleep with the humiliating jokes of the “night-show-clowns” about “the dictator” Putin and “barbaric” Russians, whose 13 hackers changed the electoral minds of millions of naïve Americans. Wow! What a powerful “gasoline station country”- Russia, as Senator McCain calls it. If in 1992 the people in my city who heard my accent were very nice to me and to Russia, now the usual reaction is to stare at me like a goat at the newly painted gates. One of my neighbors even yelled at me when I answered his question about my recent trip to Russia. I told him: “Russians like Putin because he saved their country from collapse. I saw with my own eyes how Russia has changed since my last trip there. I didn’t see the impact of Obama’s sanctions, Russians have better roads, than we have in Colorado; the shops, are filled with all kinds of products; the churches are restored…” My neighbor who didn’t like Trump yelled at me: “If you like Russia go back to your country!” My answer was: “I love Russia but I am American – like your immigrant wife, like you. I love America for a lot of reasons, one of them – the right to speak! Nobody should privatize this right.” He ran away, later coming to apologize… My wife, knowing my hard-tempered character asks me not to talk about policy – Putin-Trump anymore. And I don’t, to a certain degree. However, when someone asks me about Russia or Putin I usually answer, giving my point of view; I just cannot be silent. I was silent for 40+ years living in the USSR, not anymore! Of course, not everyone likes my answers, like the man I am going to tell you about. So, I went into the sauna; a stout man was sitting on the upper bench. He was the same age as I. Many of the older men in America call ourselves “old farts.” The name is not offensive to us, because we really do not care about our image, and because we like to make jokes about everything, mostly about ourselves. Usually, we old farts are nice, we love to talk, even in the sauna. Young people nowadays do not talk. They turn on their phones even in the sauna – I bet they do not know how to talk with other people. They cover their “secrets” in towels while we do not – we do not have any secrets anymore. Anyway, the man said hello to me, I answered, and he caught my slight accent. “Where are you from?” It’s a question I am usually asked. “From here.” I answered. He was a little confused. I knew what usually followed if I had said – “from Kazakhstan.” Usually, there would be an exchange of this type: “Where is it?” – “Between Russia and China,” – “How do you like it here?” The silly film “Borat” helped me for a short period of time. People were smiling, as if they met Sasha Cohen, and I was happy that at least they knew some geography, though the film was silly and the geography in it was completely mistaken. “No, I mean originally where are you from?” The guy, let’s call him Tony, found the right question. I decided not to check his geography skills and said that I came from Russia. The dialog that followed was remarkable. Here it is. “Welcome to America! Your English is pretty good!” “Yours, too.” He didn’t get my humor. “Just joking,” I said, “As for welcoming, it’s a little late: I have lived here for 25 years.” “Have you been in Russia lately?” He asked. “Yes, I go there every year.” “Wow. So, what do you think about that crazy guy…, Pyutin?” “Sorry, honey,” – I apologized to my wife in my thoughts and picked up the gauntlet. “You mean Putin? He is not crazy. Actually, he is one of the smartest rulers Russia ever had.” I said. Tony’s eyes nearly leaped from their sockets. “But he is a dictator and kills people!” “I wouldn’t call him a dictator – he was just last week elected by nearly 67% of Russians. I would call him an authoritarian, strong ruler; but a weak ruler in Russia wouldn’t survive a day. Besides, there were seven people opposed him in the election!” Tony smiled. “You call it an election? He chose the opponents himself from his friends. The whole world knows that elections in Russia are a sham!” “Who told you this nonsense, Tony? Did you listen to the debates? Did you hear how these people yelled at each other and cursed Putin, asking people to vote for them not for Putin. They really were as tough as Hillary to Donald! And besides, there were a lot of observers from 110 countries. They claimed the election was legitimate.” “No, I do not believe you.” “You may not believe me but I am citing the international organizations reports. You may check their reports on the Internet yourself. You may even sue these organizations if you wish.” Tony was silent for a minute, then turned his head to me and asked: “You know that Pyutin is evil even to his own people?” “You mean Putin? Who told you? How many Russians share your opinion?” “McCain.” “Is he Russian?” “No, but he knows that Pyutin is KGB.” “His name is Putin!” I tried to correct at least this in his mind. “So, you do not believe me, a Russian, who just returned from Russia, but you believe this Senator, who hates Putin and Russia? Besides, there are no KGB anymore.” “But he used to be KGB?” “Yes, and Bush H. was also a CIA agent. So, what? After the collapse of the Soviet Union there were no people who didn’t work for government in that country, we all worked for government! Putin is good for Russia, he is the brightest politician nowadays. He is like a great Chess-master, and he is a dangerous player. We must be careful with him. Some Congressmen are underestimating Russia, calling it “a gasoline station with nukes,” but I was there this summer and saw with my own eyes how much people love Putin, and how much he is doing to make that country great again.” “Yeh, yeh, yeh…” Tony didn’t know what to say. Then he recalled something and turned his red face to me. “Well, he invaded Crimea, and Ukraine!” “No, he did not. Crimea was a harbor for the Russian navy, and according to the treaty between Ukraine and Russia there were sixteen thousand Russian troops stationed there on a permanent base. There were about twenty-three thousand Ukrainian troops there, too. So, when the thugs in Kiev took power, illegally kicking out president Yanukovych and killing the political opponents, the Crimean people decided to organize a referendum. Ninety-six percent decided to reunite with Russia, as they were Russians for nearly 400 years before the Communist dictator Khrushchev gave that peninsula to Ukraine as a present to his native land.” “But they had no right to secede from the main land of Ukraine!” “Yes, they did. International law gives the right for self-determination to people. Remember, we split from the British Empire.” “But it was so long ago!” “Okay, what about East and West Germany or Kosovo? The people in these countries also exercised their right of self-determination, but they didn’t have any referendum as far as I know.” Tony looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you.” “You have the right not to believe me. You asked, I answered.” Tony was silent for a while. Then he threw out his last argument. “I hope you wouldn’t deny that Putin killed British citizens recently, using KGB gas!” Wow, he pronounced “Putin” correctly! I smiled. The nice face of my American wife appeared in my head again, and she was not happy! I kissed her in my thoughts and finished the conversation with my last knockout blow: “I wouldn’t deny it if the poisoning by Russians had been proved!” “But it was proved by Teresa May!” “Really? What did she say?” “She said that it was Putin who poisoned the British citizens!” “Not really, my friend. She said that it was “highly likely” that Russia did it! Besides, only Mr. Skripal is a British citizen, his daughter is a Russian citizen” “Does it make any difference?” “You mean, “highly likely” is proof to punish somebody? What about one of the main pillars of democracy – innocent until proven guilty?” “But we believe our allies, not the Russians!” That statement made me laugh. “You believe not facts but political statements without any facts? Wow! What kind of democracy is that?” Tony’s face became so red that I was afraid it would melt. He stood up from the bench and without looking at me firmly said: “Russians are our enemies, and democracy does not apply to them.” He left, leaving me with a sudden fear of approaching nuclear war. At night I prayed for peace. I prayed for American and Russian people-in-power who could easily destroy this fragile planet. If people refuse to understand each other, they fight. Kennedy and Khrushchev fortunately understood this. Will Putin and Trump understand? The Daily Squib defends the right of freedom of speech from every faction, and we defend this right to the death even though we may not always agree with every opinion.",1
"Theresa May’s lacklustre insipid efforts towards Brexit will hopefully be shut down soon. She has sought to delay Brexit for as long as possible so that Remainers can undermine it; she has sought to tie the UK to the EU Customs Union leaving Britain with no way of making its own trade deals, she has colluded with Philip Hammond and other Remainers in thwarting Brexit at every turn whilst pretending to conduct business for the benefit of Britain leaving the EU, she and her Remainer business secretary Greg Clark have sought to bring back Project Fear to put through the ridiculous Customs Union plan. In short, if Britain has its hands tied by any form of EU Customs Union then there will effectively be no Brexit. The same goes for the Single Market, if Britain stays in, then there is no Brexit. It is now down to the ERG to do something about this debacle which has fallen upon the laps of the people who voted on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU in the EU Referendum. May must be stopped at all costs, and the rest of the Remainers purged, and demoted to the Outer Hebrides. If it was up to many Rees-Mogg would become PM, but quite rightly his stance on socialist matters is too strong, and there needs to be a PM who can appease the socialist contingent yet conduct a full on Brexit. Enter, Boris Johnson. This is what the country needs right now, and it would put the fear of god into the caterwauling treasonous Remainers and their Brussels overlords. There is no time to lose. If May persists with her idiocy, then she must be put down with no mercy. Time is running out, and once a real PM is installed, the ridiculous transitionary period can be put to bed too, along with all the other concessions Theresa May has given Brussels. She will not be missed, only remembered as the sad old grey thing that did not deliver one single thing on election promises, but instead tried to keep the UK in the EU through the backdoor.",1
"W riting services are not a surprise these days. Every student has, at least once, ordered a paper or an essay online. Writing services have become an incredibly useful tool for those, who work a lot and do not have enough time to conduct various researches. Considering the popularity of the above-mentioned services, the number of UK essay writing services is constantly growing, which makes it difficult to choose a reliable one. It is worth noting that not all of these services provide high-quality assistance. So what to do, if you need help with your paper? How to find a good writing company? Criteria For Choosing A Reputable Essay-writing Service Recommendation. One of the best ways to find a reputable writing service is to ask students, who use such resources all the time. They always have experience of ordering at various websites and can give a grounded recommendation where you should order essays and where not. Choose companies that specialise in your subject. Excellent-quality companies provide help with essays, researches and other types of academic writing but they usually indicate, which subjects they specialise in. Good writing resource cannot provide writers that specialise in all subjects and areas. If you happen to find such website, be careful, as in the end, you might receive a poorly written text. When visiting a particular writing website, pay attention to the list of subjects – they are usually specified on the main page. Writer’s qualification. The next criterion, which should be taken into consideration, is writer’s experience and qualification. Well-known and reputable writing companies pay special attention to the quality of services they provide. For this reason, they cooperate or employ only experienced writers, who have PhD or Master’s Degree. However, essay writing services do not always provide detailed information about their writers. That is why customers reviews and feedback will be helpful. You can easily find those on writing company’s website or students’ forums dedicated to similar topics. If the writer has low rating, his or her work is characterised as poor quality. Plagiarism free texts. One of the main reasons students are not using writing websites is that they are afraid of getting a text that will be disqualified by a college professor. It relates to plagiarism and not meeting academic requirements. Writing companies with profound experience are very well aware of academic requirements and make sure that all completed texts comply with these requirements. Moreover, all texts are written from scratch and undergo check for plagiarism. You should not be worried about having the same essay or paper some other student has. Deadline. Meeting deadlines is crucially important for academic curriculum and writing companies know that. This is one of criteria of defining services reputation. If a company has a record of deadline failures, you will easily find record on the Internet. When ordering a certain type of work, make sure that the writing service s able to complete assignment within indicated period of time. However, it does not mean that you should leave it for the last minute and order an essay online just two hours before the deadline. Even though most writing services accept urgent orders, their completion depends on the volume and difficulty. Order as soon as you get the assignment from your professor. Customer support. You can tell a lot by the quality of assistance provided by Customer support team. You need the essay writing company with reliable and easily reachable team as things do not always go the way we plan. If you have any difficulties placing an order, or you simply have questions regarding your order, the writing service should be able to provide you with help immediate. Try to chat with the representative of Customer support to check how quickly they process inquiries. The quicker, the better.",1
"Who makes the guest list for what is the premier social event royal wedding of 2018 in the UK is the subject of constant speculation. Part of the fun with royal betting is having a novelty wager or two on who will be invited to this glorious occasion, so here are six celebrities tipped to attend the ceremony. Boris Johnson While invitations to current politicians seem unlikely according to reports, nobody in that sphere typifies this Anglo-American union better than the Foreign Secretary. Boris Johnson was born in the United States and held citizenship there until 2016. He’s 2/1 to be in attendance and was Mayor of London when the city hosted the 2012 Olympic Games for which Harry was an ambassador. Serena Williams While Roger Federer joined bride-to-be Markle on this year’s 100 most influential people list published annually by Time Magazine, it’s another dominant force in modern tennis in Serena Williams that she’s good friends with. The most successful athlete on court in the Open Era in the women’s game has even had some wedding advice for Markle. Williams is 1/7 to be on the guest list. Sir Elton John Given the friendship he had with Prince Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, it’s no surprise to find music legend Sir Elton John long odds-on at 1/50 with Betfair to be at his wedding. John is best known for rewriting Candle In The Wind as a tribute to Diana when she died following a car crash in Paris back in 1997 and speculation is mounting he will perform during Harry and Meghan’s nuptials. Natalie Pinkham As the groom there’s always that tough decision of whether to invite an ex-girlfriend you still get on well with to your wedding where you’re marrying someone else or not. Sky Sports’ Formula 1 pit lane reporter Natalie Pinkham is one such former flame for Harry. Things can’t be that awkward between them, if the betting is any indicator, and she could well be there as she’s evens in the market to attend the ceremony. Sean Connery Who wouldn’t want the original James Bond at their wedding? Sean Connery is certainly Harry’s favourite actor to have portrayed the iconic British spy as he infamously told the current 007, Daniel Craig, a few years back during the premiere of Quantum Of Solace. Connery’s presence at the Royal Wedding would hardly leave us shaken (but not stirred) as he’s 3/1 in the betting to be there. Simon Cowell And finally, another familiar face from the world of entertainment. Simon Cowell is of course the driving force behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent. These hugely popular TV shows have elevated him to celebrity status. Cowell is 5/1 to attend the Royal Wedding – high-waisted trousers and all!",1
"“I’s be honoured to stand along the route of the royal carriage and wave me flag for the newlyweds at the royal wedding,” Ivor Munter, 32, a peasant from Muckleworth, East London, told the BBC. According to the palace, the peasants won’t just be celebrating in the streets, but some have also been invited to attend the wedding itself, Meghan Markle and her family are so lucky. One of Us “Meghan even invited her hairdresser, butcher and road sweeper from her hometown, as well as members of her family. It’s going to be a grand affair and a right royal knees up, innit” Jack Mungo, a postman from Barking told the Sun. All over Britain, there will be street parties laid out for the starving peasants. “I ain’t eaten for a fortnight. I’ll be glad to get a bit o’ bread and soup when the wedding happens in a few weeks. Our feudal lords are so good to us,” Harry Pilchard, a peasant from the village of Shister in Yorkshire, told the BBC. Some peasants will even be given a commemorative plate with the royal couple adorning it, shame most won’t have much food to put on the plate.",1
"Socialism is a never ending cycle of poverty Socialists all over the world are essentially farmers, they farm people who are poor, ethnic, disadvantaged. Socialism farms the poor and ethnic minorities for a number of reasons: funding, and votes. This is why socialists welcome mass migration, because essentially they are exploiting the suffering of migrants desperately seeking help — to gain voters in elections. “Once we help legal and illegal immigrants into our country, then we ply them with free benefits/housing/education/healthcare and these poor migrants will vote for us at each election guaranteed. It’s a no brainer. Look what Tony Blair did, he let in over 4.8 million migrants in less than two years and won two elections. The more migrants we let in, the more guaranteed votes we get,” a Labour spokesman revealed. Suffice to say, voting for a party other than socialist is not going to happen in any general election by a migrant who was helped in by socialists. This way, the socialists build up a vast base of voters made up of poor people, migrants, and other marginalised elements. Socialists at the top of the pyramid either in media or politics are extremely rich, and they utilise poor people as their pawns for virtue signalling political displays. It is therefore in the interests of socialists to keep poor people poor, and preferably dumb. This is why under any socialist education system the curriculums are dumbed down to a level of idiocy, or retardation. “As socialists we certainly do not want an awake public, we want people to follow us blindly and without question. This is why the Millennial generation are so pliant, they do not want freedom, in fact they rally against freedom. They have been dumbed down so much and indoctrinated by socialists, they have no thoughts of their own. For socialists, this is brilliant, because we do not want ethnics or migrants or poor people to wake up and see how we are exploiting them,” another socialist Labour party official said. Socialism is a strand of Marxism, and ultimately a cousin of communism, however, today’s students, who are so indoctrinated in socialist political ways, are too blind to see that they are ultimately moving towards full blown communism, which is the final hurdle for socialism. Those at the hierarchy of any socialist party always hide their assets, and always claim to be working for little or nothing, whilst of course dining in the best restaurants, and milking the system for as much as they can. An example of course would be the previous American president Obama, who spent over $189 million of taxpayers money on holidays for him, his entourage, his wife’s entourage and their kids. Obama milked the nation out of so much money that during his tenure the deficit rose from $9 Trillion to over $23 Trillion. Now that’s socialism at work. Spend, until other people’s money runs out…as Maggie once said. One of the biggest stooge’s of socialists of course is the racism card, and they use black and minority people as a battering ram against anything that is deemed conservative or for the nation. Socialists detest their own nation, and it is this self-hatred as well as their exploitation of minorities which brings in more votes in elections. In reality of course, the hierarchy socialists are even more racist than conservatives or equally racist, however where conservatives are more truthful in their racism, socialists would rather die than being revealed as a racist exploitative piece of shit, they would rather lie and lie to get away with any truth coming out. Socialists out of many political ideologies are indeed the most devious and nasty, and with the use of the mostly left-wing media, they are even more dangerous when out of power. We can see this with the soviet styled #metoo movement, and the underhand techniques of mass censorship of any alternative views by leftie tech monopolies. Censorship was a very efficient tool in Soviet Russia and modern communist China, and socialists use it very efficiently today cutting down free speech with a vehemence unrivalled by any other doctrine. Socialists need you to stay poor, they will give you more benefits to keep you in that vicious cycle of poverty. They need you to stay uneducated so they will dumb down school curriculums. Socialists will demand fast mass migration and once they get it, and it gets to election time, they will have voters ready to vote for them without question. Socialists exploit ethnic groups as a means to hit the right, and as much as they detest ethnics, they will put them as visibly in power, even though behind the scenes they will always be mere puppets to the same old white haired white men. Socialists when in power will do everything to keep social mobility down. One thing they never want is poor people educating themselves and moving up a notch. This would mean they might eventually vote conservative. It is therefore in the socialist’s interests to keep poor and ethnic people down by putting obstacles in their way stopping them from improving their standing. Socialism is the biggest lie that no one ever mentioned, and it is using millions of useful idiots day in day out to get the job done. Bravo to socialism. It is truly working.",1
"What better way to get killer robots to do what you want them to do — get them addicted to vodka. The AI killer robots used by the Russian army are heavy duty alcoholics who feast on copious amounts of vodka. Russian army technician, Colonel Vladimir Dimitrov, revealed how the AI killer robots have to quench their thirst. “We first get them used to the vodka. For a few months they are pumped with the good stuff, then we suddenly withdraw all vodka. The robots naturally go crazy, their addiction is so so great they will do anything for their next fix. This is when we ask them to kill everything in sight, and afterwards they get a big tanker of vodka for a reward.” Much like the Russian army regulars who are fuelled by vodka, the robots take no prisoners when they get their thirst. The robots designed by Russian army engineers are nothing more than little tanks with turrets but in squads of fifty to a hundred armed with machine gun turrets and missiles are devastating, especially if they have not had vodka for a few days. “You ever seen an angry Russian who has not had his vodka for a day or so? They get angry, itchy, with sudden outbursts, sweating like pigs. Our robots get very angry, we have to handle them with caution. Even though we have programmed them to not hurt us, the vodka desire makes their AI irrational,” Dimitrov added. NATO high command officials are said to be weary of such Russian ingenuity, and are trying to counteract the deadly vodka addicted Russian robots by introducing a type of robot that will strike fear into any enemy that dares to attack — AI robots that are addicted to coffee. Yes, the fuel for the new autonomous will be a Starbucks dream come true. AI engineer, Miles Rubio, explained how the robots are fuelled at a recent Military Symposium in Switzerland. “Americans are fuelled by coffee. We wanted something that makes Americans go crazy if they don’t get their fix, and that’s the coffee. These robots much like Americans go absolutely nuts if they don’t have gallons of coffee daily. This is how we made the robots into very efficient killers…lol.”",1
"The devious nature of the majority of the unelected members of the House of Lords will be finally curtailed after the House of Commons passes new laws that will effectively abolish any powers the Lords currently have. The fast bi-partisan action will take place by the end of the month, as a matter of urgency, Hansard, recorded. Speaking in the Commons, one MP was livid at the backhand behaviour of the Remainer-led House of Lords who seek to derail Brexit. “There is a very good reason these unelected House of Lords peers are trying their best to stop Brexit. It is of course about their EU payments. The EU pays off 30 former MEPs and officials in the Lords with £500,000 a year in pensions. “They include seven ex-European Commissioners who swore an oath of loyalty to Brussels that means they risk losing their pension if they attack their old institutions. “It would take a combined pension pot of £10million to provide retirement income for the ex-EU peers on the same scale in the private sector. We must stop this backhander mentality where these Lords are betraying their own nation, and the democratic right of the people for wads of EU cash in brown envelopes.” Meanwhile, Lord Mandelson of Anusholl, Cumbria, was adamant that thwarting Brexit is actually a democratic process. “It does not mean a thing that I get huge payoffs from Brussels. All I care about is Italian marble on my bathroom floor, it is so shiny and fabulous to touch. My friends roll about on it all the time. I have to have the best Italian workmanship when it comes to marble flooring. Where else am I to get the money for such exquisite Italian marble floors? Yes, of course I will betray Britain for it. Ooh darling. Have you seen the shine on the floor?” Kinnock EU Gravy Train Research from Open Europe think tank reveals Baroness Kinnock earned £774,838 as an MEP. She was also entitled to a daily subsistence allowance worth £505,818 over that time, travel allowances worth almost £1.25million and general allowances worth £577,071. In addition, she was entitled to secretarial allowances worth more than £2.3million, although these are to pay staff.She also has a pension worth £67,836 a year, which would require a pot of £950,000 to buy in the private sector. Lord Kinnock earned £1.85million in salary during his 10 years at the EU and qualified for a residence allowance for living in Brussels worth £276,962, an entertainment allowance worth £64,564, an installation allowance of £25,348 for taking the job, a resettlement allowance of £13,745 for leaving the job and a transition allowance, to help adjust to life outside Brussels, worth £355,143. He also qualifies for a pension which pays out £96,857 a year and cost £1.16million to buy in the private sector. The terms require him to remain supportive of the EU project. In all, the Kinnocks qualified for pay, allowances and pensions worth £10.2million. The lack of receipts required for EU expenses makes it impossible to know if they claimed living allowances on the same home.",1
"An essential problem that humanity has encountered in the last 50 or so years has been that we have discovered ways to completely annihilate ourselves from the face of the planet. This is a problem because of two reasons. The first is that we are still a very long way from assuring our survival as a species. We cannot protect our cities from natural disaster including floods, earthquakes, mudslides and even Tsunamis. And even the weapons that we create to kill each other so effectively with, we have not found remedies for them. The second reason is scarier than the first. World leaders, the people who have the keys to Doomsday, seem not have matured socially. This can be easily seen by their choice of isolationist strategies. These are ideas from a dead generation that did not leave in the global village that the world has become. No longer can the success or failure of one nation or region be contained in that area. We are all affected by the decisions of people on the other side of the globe. The Gambler’s Solution At least we know that we will have one world leader who will understand the advice we are about to hand out. Donald Trump, a casino mogul understands that to survive in life and real money casino games you have to be ready to respond to any change in environment. The world’s social environment has changed. Things you could do and get away with a decade ago are now potent in killing a career than being bitten by a black mamba. There can no longer be an arms race between a small groups of super countries. The technology they develop is now available to everyone. The Internet offers more than just real money online gambling and you can learn more about online gambling by visiting www.australiaonlinecasinos.net. Information on how to make a seriously lethal weapon can also be found online. A probable solution is for the big superpowers to arbitrate smaller nations when they quarrel. By finding a win/win settlement point, peace can be secured in our lifetime.",1
"If things can’t get any worse for Brexit or the stained Theresa May cabinet, how about including another incompetent nincompoop for the role of Home Secretary. Out goes the blubbing oestrogen mess of Amber Rudd, another Remainer who fouled things up so badly that it has left a distinct stench of rotten eggs in the chambers. In comes a guy who one could say is a big rotten egg, who campaigned furiously during the EU Referendum against Brexit. “One of the advantages of EU membership is that we get to negotiate wider and deeper trade deals from a position of strength. If we leave, the boot will be on the other foot – and that will put Britain at a serious disadvantage.” 14 MAY 2016 Whatever Javid says today, much like May and the other Remainers in the Cabinet, must be taken with a pinch of salt. Nothing the Remainer-led cabinet has done has been good for Brexit or been true to the EU Referendum. All that they say is a series of backpeddled lies, and more lies to forward their agenda of staying under the wing of Brussels after the so-called Brexit. They want to stay in the Single Market and they want to stay in the Customs Union, therefore rendering any form of Brexit completely redundant.",1
"Yes, yes, of course we said it all along. Brexit would be nigh on impossible, and we have sadly been proven right, time and time again. The unelected Brussels salaried House of Lords treasonous Remainers are to pass the final nail in the coffin bill for a referendum that held big promises but sadly no real fighters backing it. Britain has been proven to be a lost cowardly nation, a country of slaves who are bent over the table by the EU daily and unceremoniously fucked by large continental cocks, then brutally ordered to clean up the mess afterwards. There is no dignity left in a country where snivelling weasel traitor Remainers jostle with each other for the best position to be violently anally raped by their laughing foreign controllers who then spit on their Remainer heads as reward. The Battle of Britain was fought for nothing as was the whole of World War II. It is ironic that Britain declared victory yet have now fallen to slavery of the EU unelected masters ruling over them and dictating their laws. Millions thus died for a meaningless Pyrrhic victory. Lest we forget the treachery of Theresa May who was instated as PM for the very reason of the ultimate betrayal. Brexit was a utopian dream of freedom. Unfortunately, dream’s cannot be realised in already conquered countries, especially when there is so much home made treachery about. No Brexit. The whole thing was just a mirage…a brief glimpse across the prison walls….a slight ray of light through the prison bars….now all hope is gone….the dove of light is diseased, turning black, shrivelling up and dying. Let us set sail once again, make our own trade deals, be the masters of our own destiny, make our own laws…a dream…fading in the now tumultuous waters…sharks ripping at the oars…wake up…this is still Britain under dystopian control from the EU, gloating with glee at their nefarious victory over the defeated Britons they snigger as the free money continues its flow into their overloaded coffers. Once a strong nation, now nothing more than inhabited by lazy, cowardly losers with no fucking balls.",1
"It’s not only the supermarket food wrapped in plastics that kill you, or the so-called safe bottled water you drink, but now we can add the LED streetlights to the mix. What better way to reduce the population through such an innocent medium — light. Modern street lamps are triggering thousands of cancer cases, according to new research from the University of Exeter. A study found men living in large cities are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer while women are one and a half times more prone to breast cancer. Scientists blame the worrying trend on the ‘blue light’ emitted by LEDs. This reduces levels of melatonin which controls the body clock. Add into the mix the damage to human cells that radiofrequency energy does every time you use your mobile phone or are near a mast; and the Bisphenol A you ingest from all supermarket products, and the multiple types of engineered chemicals you take in from processed foods, the chemtrails, as well as the micro-carbons you breathe in from traffic fumes, naturally, the human body reacts to this — it creates changes in your body — tumours, anomalies, grotesque mutations. In short — Cancer. Who is doing this? …and why? And from this we have created an illusion, so large, so vast it will escape their perception. Those who will see it will be thought of as insane. We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us. We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur. We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute. We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, ageing accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn. The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems. The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far. We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones. Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons. With sugar they shall be sweetened on their way to early extinction. They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect. When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them it is for their help. We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things. When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future. When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine. We will render them docile and weak before us by our power. They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison. We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all. Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say. If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives. Virtual reality, apps, mobile phones, websites, streaming media, social networks, games, eventually leading them to be microchipped in their brains which they will accept wholeheartedly without question. We will use fear as our weapon. We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides. We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan. They will perform the labour for us and we shall prosper from their toil. Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way. We will make them kill each other when it suits us. We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion. We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves. We will foment animosity between them through our factions. When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbours for as long as we see fit. We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us. We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths. We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished. We will continue to make them live in fear and anger though images and sounds. We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this. The tools will be provided by their labour. We will make them hate themselves and their neighbours. We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know! They must never know that colour is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt. When they shall band together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media. We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favour. When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that. They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons. The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves. When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.",1
"Good news rarely comes in these days, but when it does, sneeze into your napkin and thank the stars above for finally delivering justice upon Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby will be going to jail hopefully for a long time after being convicted of rape. The jury in Bill Cosby’s retrial found the TV icon guilty of all three counts of aggravated indecent assault on Thursday for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home in a Philadelphia suburb in 2004. The 80-year-old comedian faces up to 10 years in prison on each count, but is likely to serve them concurrently. It has been a long time coming, but America’s Daddy is a rapist and deserves everything he gets. Already, the jail where Cosby will go is getting ready for their celebrity rapist guest. San Quentin State Prison, located north of San Francisco is preparing the cell for Bill and is looking forward to his arrival. “We got a special cell mate for Cosby. His name is Bubba. He is 7’2 weighing 380 lbs. He likes old guys and we in the prison service just look the other way when he wants to get his way. Bubba is already stocking up on lube which he gets from the machine shop where he works,” the prison’s warden, Chuck Mallory told the San Fran Times. It has been many years in the making, but Mr Cosby has been a slippery customer, justice has a way of rearing its greasy head in between those butt cheeks once in awhile, even with rigged justice systems geared to the advantage of celebrities in the U.S. Enjoy your stay Dr. Huxtable..",1
"Former prime minister, Theresa May was today licking her wounds after a devastating coup by Tory Brexiteers who ousted her late last night from her job. The spectacular coup was completed in 15 minutes according to those present, and May had no discourse but to resign in shame after the way she had handled the Brexit. “May who has conceded too much to the EU was as useful as a drum kit in Anne Frank’s attic. She is obviously a Remainer, therefore she does not have a mandate to safeguard this nation from those who seek to do it harm. We had to remove her to gain back our sovereignty,” one backbencher revealed. Indeed, Theresa May capitulated much to the EU demands, and if it was not for the coup, Britain would have been stuck in the Customs Union and Single Market. This effectively would mean there would not be a Brexit, and Britain would not have been able to make its own trade deals, as well as control its own borders. “It is safe to say that May listened to Remainers more than Brexiteers. The House of Lords’ unelected peers who defeated the government on a recent Brexit bill were on large payrolls from Brussels, so naturally they were paid off corrupted individuals who willingly sold their own country off for backhanders from the EU. However, the former PM, was not paid off by Brussels to our knowledge, but betrayed her own country through sheer unwillingness to stand up to Brussels and their ludicrous demands,” another backbencher revealed. The new PM, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has struck fear into the heart of the EU, and is even planning on curtailing the crooked Remainer unelected peers in the House of Lords, many of which are receiving backhanders from Brussels. This spectacular turn of events can only be good for Britain, which needs someone as strong as Thatcher to pull through the slings and arrows of outrageous EU demands.",1
"One can’t fault the selfless nature of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, who has popped out another sprog, one of many, and there are more to come. The third baby in a few years is an incredible job for Kate who has achieved real momentum in the Windsor family. Royal correspondent, Cressida Montague commented on the wonderful news following the third birth. “I think it stems from Kate’s background, her ancestral coal mining family. In those days families had to have ten or twenty children because the mortality rate for infants was so high. We’re talking about the 19th century coming on to the early 20th century. It’s just in her blood. She has to pop one out every few years as a form of inbuilt centuries old instinct.” In 1821, Middleton’s great-great-great-great grandfather James Harrison was a miner in the north east. It was far removed from palace life in London, where Prince William’s great-great-great-great-great uncle, King George IV, was living a life of opulent luxury and debauchery as an overly indulgent monarch. When George IV died and his younger brother ascended the throne, Harrison’s male children, as young as 11, were being lowered into the coal pits. Plans for new wing When most royals have one or two at the most, the Cambridges want to go for five or seven. There are plans to even build a whole new wing to Kensington palace to house the lot of them. Sir Reginald Mathers, an advisor to the royal couple has announced the building of a totally new wing for Kensington palace to start in 2020. “We’re expecting three or four more babies so now is the time to start building a garish new wing for the children to be housed. The cost to the taxpayer will not be announced, or the upkeep costs.” Meanwhile, the duchess, who has never worked an honest day’s work in her life, is happily content in her role as a royal baby pumper, pumping out the blighters two a dozen every few years. Here’s to a royal income boost, the other side of the coin perhaps, for each little critter an x amount income boost, much like benefits — but the royal kind.",1
"British PM Theresa May, who suddenly started displaying the effects of rigor mortis on Monday is currently being examined in a covert governmental facility somewhere in Salisbury. Number 10 aides were alerted to the PM’s condition this morning at breakfast time when she was making some toast and talking about her lacklustre performance for Brexit as well as how she plans to concede all terms to the EU. “She was making the toast, then I noticed cracking sounds coming from her face. Her body stiffened and then as if struck by Medusa’s gaze she froze like a statue. We carried her out to the hallway and she just stood there with an open dead gaze. After calling the medic he surmised that the PM was having a bout of rigor mortis, although he could record a faint pulse,” Number 10 aide, Ashley Sommer, told the Daily Telegraph. Rigor mortis The prime minister may have been accidentally zapped by a governmental program that is used to control the population. Utilising microwave energy within the biolelectric wave spectrum, the electromagnetic waves are broadcast from mobile phone masts, wifi and from mobile delivery systems. “The CIA in the US developed the system in the 1990s as a way to control humans en masse as well as individuals who they wish to either eliminate or put under their control. “By the use of the bioelectric spectrum, mostly at 10 Hz, when inducing a form of rigor mortis over the victim, the program can render humans inactive and unable to function in daily life. They can also transmit images into the minds of individuals. For example, say a target is already mentally unstable, if the active control centre transmits images inducing the individual to carry out a mass shooting, then it can be very effective. This technique is especially useful in areas of black ops, to engender a population crisis regarding gun control or any other usage of the Hegellian Dialectic,” chief engineer at Los Alamos weapons research facility revealed last year. Questions are however being asked about how on earth the PM was accidentally zapped by the covert control system. A parliamentary body will discuss the findings today, however, the program is top secret and will have to be handled behind closed doors. Meanwhile, an emergency meeting of Cobra was announced by the deputy prime minister. “Unfortunately, we cannot discuss the circumstances under which the PM has been struck down. These programs are heavily classified and officially do not exist,” a Number 10 spokesman revealed today.",1
"Arriving in the lush green hills of Uganda in deepest Africa, Tarana Burke, the #metoo founder funded by George Soros has come on a fact finding anthropological/biological study on the relationships wild animals have with each other. “I want to find out what the biological instinct of the male is in wild animals. I am eager to first study the mountain gorillas in the forests of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Volcanoes National Park,” #metoo creator, Burke told the National Geographic. Deep in the jungle, the expensive trip is set to cost over $32 million, and is of course further funded by the Soros Open Society fund, as well as other agencies that fund the #metoo movement. Gorillas in the mist “The male gorilla is usually dominant in the troop. Dominant male gorillas are called silverbacks and are more aggressive than other group members since the troop’s safety is their responsibility. The silverback makes all group decisions, is responsible for most of the group calls, receives the dominant portion of food (even when resources are limited) and can terminate troublesome behaviour with just a vicious look. A male must have an established home range and great strength to confront any rival before acquiring his own troop. Therefore most silverbacks are usually solitary for about 4 years and turn 15 before acquiring a troop of their own,” Burke revealed in her study. Unfortunately, the plight of the gorillas is in constant flux due to the threat of poachers, however thanks to great care in the sanctuaries of the national parks they are relatively safe. Pride of the lion “I also studied the male lion in their prides to better understand the natural biological makeup of things. It seems the male lions rarely survive to adulthood. This is why there are many more females in each pride. It is very hard to survive to adulthood if you are a male. “When male lions begin to reach sexual maturity around age two, the older males within the pride kick them out. The female lions, which are usually all related to some degree, typically stay behind. “Life is very hard for the male lions. For a young male, the betrayal by his own blood must be confusing to him, but this is an ancient rite — the casting out of young males into a world of unknowns — a world where he will be able make it, or die. “After being kicked out, the young males roam the countryside solo or in small bands, often with their brothers or cousins, negotiating the no-cat’s-land between territories of other lions. If they stray into these territories, they are likely to be attacked or killed. A majority of male lions die during this time. “Lions are also prized by human hunters and poachers so that is an additional factor to the survival of the male lions. “If they survive long enough to find a promising new area, the next step is to take over another pride. But of course resident males will have none of that, and so they end up fighting, often to the death. “When male lions take over a new territory, they almost always kill the prides’ cubs, since they are not biologically related and do not want to spend energy ensuring that other lions’ genes will be passed on. Lions cannot be stepfathers, also female lions will not be receptive to mating while they are nursing, so killing the cubs enables the male lions to procreate.” Burke’s study of natural wildlife animal behaviours and instincts has somewhat changed her view of the anti-male #metoo fiasco which she heads. “I realised that there is a biological reason for most behaviour. Although humans are top of the animal chain and generally not tied to brute instinct, we still have these urges, which we control for most of the time. It is natural for the male of the species to generally be on top of the female in most cases. The female is submissive in most animal groups and this should include the female human. We are not equal, we are human, they are animals, but male and female are not equal and will never be. This is the biological way and the male of the species is always going to have different characteristics than the female. We must accept these differences as it is ingrained in biology.”",1
"Pest controllers have been called out to the House of Lords after an outbreak of filthy fucking rats turned the former respectable establishment into a sewer. Led by chief filthy sewer rat, Lord Adonis, the rats ran amuck across the House of Lords spreading treachery and other un-democratic anti-voter sentiment. “These treacherous rats must be cleaned out. They are stinking out the whole establishment with their authoritarian socialist pseudo-Marxist sewage, and selling out their own country to our enemies,” one of the only upstanding Lords left, Lord Lamont remarked. The filthy rats that are creating such an outright mess escaped from a sewer pipe on Monday, and have been running across all the seats in the House demanding £300 each to sit down. “The filthy fucking rat, Lord Adonis, who looks nothing like Adonis, is a real nuisance.

"Jordan Melchoe, 24, from Los Angeles, California has been stuck in his safe space for three weeks now after being offended by his own self. His family have frantically tried to assure him that there is nothing to be offended by, however to no avail the Millennial has been seriously affected. “He drinks his soy milk every day, which increases his oestrogen levels enough to develop large bitch tits. He is a fervent supporter of a Victorian snowflake puritan lifestyle with no mention of sex or other vices that may trigger his sensitive constitution. Somehow though, he has triggered his own trigger and has offended his own snowflake sensibilities,” Melchoe’s concerned auntie told the LA Times. Microagggressions Psychologist, Brandt Mayer, has tried to coax Melchoe from his Safe Space however the many attempts have failed miserably. “The episode began under my understanding when Jordan was on YouTube and accidentally came across a heavy metal video from the 1980s. He was immediately triggered because he saw these men playing music that he had never heard before. The feeling of pure testosterone, and images of beautiful women throwing their undergarments at the men may have triggered an inert subconscious desire in him. Here he was, a miserable politically correct soy drinking loser whose genitals had shrunk, his moobs flopping all over the place listening to emasculating chart music dominated by women, here he was, an activist for feminism, anti-guns, anti-sex, anti-fun and other causes that seek to destroy the traditional family and biological natural way — he must have realised what a pathetic fucking loser he is, how he has been manipulated from the beginning by the indoctrinating politically correct school system of socialist agenda creators, and how he had passed so far from the path of masculinity.”",1
"Ordo ab Chao There will be little television coverage of the start of World War 3 because many will not know it has started, including the media. What seems important now and is covered in hysterical news headlines about World War 3 is nothing, it is simply sensationalist fairy dust as usual by the mainstream media who are only concerned about clickbait for their advertiser revenue. When World War 3 actually starts, there will be minimal coverage by the media and the events leading up to initial incursions will be seen as not interesting enough to even report. The thing about major wars is they usually start suddenly and without warning, and the third world war will be mainly conventional. The correct trigger To qualify for a world war, there has to be mobilisation from all corners of the earth. Therefore, if we have confrontations only in one part, it is not generally flagged as World War, however a fire has to start somewhere, and this usually spreads quite quickly if there is the correct territorial kindling. Furthermore, world war would inevitably have to include the world’s large powers, for it to be correctly labelled as a world war. Therefore, we would have to see the USA, Russia, China, Japan, as well as European and Australasian countries skirmish. China in a third world war scenario would immediately go for Australia and New Zealand. This would be their first move, after taking Taiwan in less than a few hours. Russia would invariably increase its territory by taking former Soviet states, as well as pushing into Sweden, Finland and Norway as well as incursions into Middle Eastern territory. Norway and Middle Eastern territories have large oil and gas reserves and would be a great prize for Russia. Norway, as well as being on the cusp of the sea, is only a small jaunt to Britain. Whether Russia would utilise nuclear weapons on the UK in an initial push is to be debated, however there is credence in thought that the Russians see the UK as a vast threat to their plans and do not see any usable resources in Britain. Most probably there would be over thirty nuclear bombs dropped on Britain to silence it once and for all, if it refuses to surrender to Russian might bearing down on it. It is safe to say that in the initial moments of Russian movement into Europe, the French would surrender almost immediately. This would be done to safeguard Paris and its architecture as in WW2. Germany would put up a fight, alongside NATO, but movement would be too slow, as the Russians have everything planned already, their main ally is speed and efficiency without slow democratic political processes slowing them down. Coupled with the threat of World War 3, there is also the race to develop robotic military functional applications, the advancement of nanotechnology used in warfare, as well as the development of Artificial Intelligent systems, by Chinese, American and Russian scientists, as well as modified chemical materials utilised in warfare. The key to all of this is, would the US utilise their nuclear arsenal if the Russians made a move into Europe? Well, to answer this, one only has to look at Hitler’s incursion into Europe before and during WW2. The Americans not only financed Hitler, but stood about watching Hitler and his army butcher their way through Poland, France and the rest of Europe. It was not until the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour that made the Americans do something, otherwise they would have done absolutely nothing. Britain would have been lost to the German forces eventually, just through sheer numbers, and dwindling supplies hit by U-boats. It is safe to say that the US would therefore be cautious in its initial actions during a Russian and Chinese incursion. One must also not forget the other rogues, or variables in the mix. Iran and North Korea, who would most probably put to their advantage any weakness seen by the Western Allies. Iran, will attack Israel from all sides, and they will be joined by other Islamic states. This action alone will not mean the end of Israel, as the militarised state will hit back with all its might crushing the attackers ruthlessly. They will then push on further into Arab territory, gaining Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran. The other big dogs of war who are itching for a fight are India and Pakistan, two nuclear capable countries. Who is to say they do not face off, maybe drop a nuke on Delhi and one on Islamabad? The aftermath of course would be cleaned up by China, as their millions of troops surge into the region on the premise of ‘Keeping the Peace’. Back in the United Nations, there will be talk, but no solution, because there can be no solution to what is irresistible for many nations, holding back for so long. The delegates will know what they are dealing with, but it will be too late, and after the talking is over, there will be even more talking — a useless conversation to a very old question. World War 3 will not necessarily be nuclear. How about cyber warfare where millions of Russian and Chinese hackers take down electricity grids/crucial utilities, or maybe an EMP burst in the upper atmosphere frying all electronic components, or what about satellites being blown up leaving many agencies and the military blind? There are effective alternatives to full nuclear war. No state in the world wants to use their nuclear arsenal because this means the territory they may conquer by conventional military warfare would be irradiated and useless. No one wants a nuclear winter covering the sun for ten years, where all vegetation and animals die off. It is not in their interests for mutual self destruction, however many bunkers they have. Therefore, it is safe to say that World War 3 will mainly be conventional warfare, however, if it comes to an end scenario where one nuclear power is in serious danger of being wiped out conventionally, then, someone like Vladimir Putin will press the red button. His stance is that if Russia ceases to exist, so should the others cease to exist. “But as a citizen of Russia, as a head of the Russian state, I want to ask – why do we need a world if Russia ceases to exist?” The precursor for war is much like a rubber band. How far can one pull back a rubber band before it snaps back into place? The natural circle and cycle of history for Mankind has always been a state of war, and since the last major war in the late 1930s to 40s, the rubber band has been stretching and stretching. Soon, the laws of physics state that the rubber band will snap back into place, much like the tectonic plates suddenly snapping back after a major earthquake. Dwindling finite resources on earth, and increasing populations mean that the final push for one singular faction to control all — is inevitable.",1
"President Assad, otherwise known as the Butcher of Syria, who has no qualms in gassing his own people, was defiant after the pretty much useless bombing of some factories that were not in use, by the Allied forces of Britain, France and the United States. “Chlorine is a very common chemical that anyone can get or make in large quantities. When we make barrel bombs to drop on civilians from our helicopters that is all we use. Therefore, what have the Allies done? Nothing much really, apart from bomb a few factories which we can rebuild anywhere else.” The defiant stance by Assad is in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has already declared victory with the seminal words seen once before “Mission Accomplished” uttered by the now retired failure, George W Bush. Apart from riling the already angry Russians, this bombing fiasco is not so much an answer to the recent gassing by whoever did it, but more of a cursory reconnaissance mission in Russian capabilities of revenge. “Ideally, the Russians will react to the bombing. This is what the Americans and allies want to see. They want to see what sort of vengeful reaction the Russians will have. This bombing was ultimately not about Assad and his use of chemical weapons on civilians, but on how Vladimir Putin reacts. Most probably, the Russians will not take direct action but will take their vengeance the quiet silent way, i.e. a major hacking cyber attack, or maybe they will do other clandestine operations to destabilise the West. You see, the Russians prefer stealth to direct obtuse action. Overt reactions are too obvious,” a former agency analyst revealed on Monday. The only way to win the war in Syria is for the Allies to invade fully with boots on the ground. Naturally, this will never happen, simply because of Russian bases present in the country.",1
"A recent Nori poll questioned internet users on the censorious biased methods of Google and Youtube staffers, revealing their pariah status excelling even that of traffic wardens. “We found that a whopping 94% of internet users now detest Google and YouTube so much that they actually prefer traffic wardens. Being a traffic warden is one of the worst jobs anyone can do in life, simply because the amount of negativity and hatred that comes your way every day, well, Google and YouTube is now ahead of that and are even more hated than those pesky traffic wardens handing out tickets,” poll manager, Allen Klein revealed. Not Evil One participant revealed that he used to like Google “before it turned evil” but now even the mere mention of the company makes his skin crawl. “Google used to be seen as this friendly company back in the day, but once they got global domination and monopoly, their true colours shone through. Now if I even see the logo I start sweating and have to look away. It’s gotten so bad that I’m using the internet less now. I used to run some websites but Google censored so much that nothing is left now and their monopoly over the world wide web is so pervasive that it’s nothing but a complete takeover.” The recent shooting spree at the Californian YouTube offices because of the policy of unjustified censorship was another indication that the tide has firmly turned from favourable to extreme hatred. “When you take away someone’s livelihood, it sometimes means that the person cracks. One only has to study the 1993 film starring Michael Douglas – Falling Down, to see how things can end up. This is what YouTube staff are doing day in day out, they’re censoring people’s rights to free speech, their right to freedom of expression and ultimately their right to make revenue off of their videos or websites. It is not only the totalitarian censorship that is disgusting but also the biased manner in which they do it,” another ex-YouTube user revealed. One other former YouTube Google user revealed: “After the way Google treated me and pretty much everyone I know; the other day when I got a ticket from a traffic warden, I frankly could not give a damn. It was nothing compared to the way biased Google mistreats its users.”",1
"Back in August 2013, the Daily Squib wrote an article warning of the West’s encroachment into Russian controlled Syria. What pundits on mainstream media are writing about today, we already figured out in 2013, and we firmly stand by our analysis of the situation now as much as then. The West must be weary of the bear backed into a corner, as crossing the red line of Syria is a one way street with no return. Today, we have Donald Trump as president of the United States, who has so far acted cautiously regarding any intrusion into Syria, even after the recent gassing by whoever did it. This is the question we must always ask, who did the deed? In a world where governments happily hurt and murder their own citizens for their own political and geopolitical gains, nothing can be counted out. There is now no trust in any global government as their nefarious techniques have too often been revealed. The news coming from Syria cannot be trusted as the mainstream media is heavily tied to governmental rules and military intelligence propaganda. Unless there are news agencies working independently on the ground free of reporting restrictions, we will never know what is really happening. Amongst the posturing, strutting apes paraded around the news desks barking for war, none of it should be believed. This is why the Daily Squib is so calm about the situation currently at hand, we simply do not believe anything will happen because the West is too fucking shit scared of Russia and the evil mastermind, Putin. If the alleged Assad gassing of civilians continues, nothing will be done again. We will of course get more baloney posturing but that’s it. The game is already won by Putin, his stranglehold of the region is complete, and Syria is the territorial global red line that cannot be crossed unless a fully fledged war ensues. There is nothing to see. Stop screaming in abject terror. This is nothing. Please go back to your boring banal life of nothingness. ",1
"Power nerds, these are a special breed of techie nerds who want to take over the world with their technological prowess. From the birth of the World Wide Web, these power nerds have created and grown companies that are now monopolies controlling every facet of people’s lives. Smartphones, apps, search engines, social networks – power nerds are in everything, their power increases daily as more millions of people use their networks. Power nerds are ruthless, they are creatures who do not balk in crushing their opponents completely without mercy and their greed for complete controlling power over everything is boundless. To quote a few examples of companies that are run by ruthless power nerds, we can of course cite Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google. These companies are not only seeking to rule and control everything, they also are using their power to manipulate data taken from their platforms to make money and increase their influence, as well as shut down any voices that are not left leaning. All Hail Zuckerberg “Power nerds are inherently evil. Zuckerberg is one example of a power nerd so power hungry that he pursues global domination with a vehement ruthless nasty streak. These tech robots are machines, they are not really human anymore, their fuel is pure power and more power, and they will use billions of people to achieve their goals at all cost. Tech power nerds are farmers of people, they farm billions of people for data,” an observer of the current situation revealed. Power nerds also do not have a problem about farming data from billions of people without their knowledge, they also abuse their positions to be politically biased and censor free speech as a means of gaining even more power. One can only hope that companies like Facebook one day are brought to justice for their evil, devious crimes committed against billions of people. In 2009, Facebook was caught lying to their account holders about the amount and type of information it was collecting on them, and the company also explicitly lied about who they were providing that information to. As a result, the Federal Trade Commission censured the company in 2011 for violations of Article 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The core mission of Article 5 of the FTC Act is to protect consumer welfare and prevent unfair business acts or practices from occurring. In defiance of the Federal Trade Commission’s order, Facebook continued to reveal their customers private account information to unauthorized individuals and corporations and is therefore liable for civil penalties of $41,484 per each violation – a fine that could reach $3 trillion Dollars. Talking about fines, Google, a company that controls 91.5% of search traffic in Europe alone, is being slapped with antitrust fines from the EU, but it’s only for a measly £2.14 billion, which for a company that pays literally no tax, is peanuts. At the end of the day, these companies led by power nerds have now spread their octopus-like grip over the whole globe, and to even begin deconstructing their evil plan of complete control, will be nearly impossible now unless these companies are fined, broken up and told to pay the tax they owe. Hopefully one day the power nerds are put in their place, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air on a free internet once again.",1

"Meghan Markle, the latest addition to the Windsor roster, is thinking of introducing some culinary delights from America to the usually bland royal menu. Usually the Windsors sup on boring old fodder. The Queen for example will break out the gin and Dubonnet before chowing down on grilled Dover sole with some sauteed veg on the side, you know maybe some spinach or a courgette. Certainly nothing starchy. Prince Charles, a boiled egg aficionado has them served by a team of twenty servants who wait for approval of each egg presented to the prince. If an egg is slightly too runny or too hard, it fails the test and is discarded. The Duke of Edinburgh is rather partial to barbecues therefore he will fit in with American cuisine very well. Speaking exclusively to Marie Claire magazine, Meghan Markle revealed her intricate plan on introducing the royals to her roots. “My momma told me she always say ‘eat up yo collard greens’ and one day you grow up to be a beautiful princess. Sho nuff, imma qualified to be a bonafide ass princess of royalty and live in a real goddamn palace wit’ servants and shiet! “First off, Imma stand up during lunch and axe da folk ‘Who’s up for some chitlins I be prepared sum earlier?’ and I knows when they smell those chitlins they be salivating at the mouth fo sho! “Once they see the food we done prepare, hmm, hmm, just like momma cook, they will know what real eats is fo sho, honey! We got deep fry ham hock, black eye beans, pork brains and eggs, cornbread, rice covered in gravy with neck bones, all served up in one tasty bowl mixed in wit’ a stick.” Certainly, the Windsors are up for anything, and the introduction of African American soul food into the diet may be just the ticket for an altogether livelier atmosphere in the royal palaces and court.",1
"Bill Pevensey, 49, accidentally called a lesbian transgender woman who used to be a gay bi-heterosexual lesbian man by the wrong gender pronoun at his office last week. Since then he has lost his job, his, dog, his wife has divorced him, and he has lost his kids, friends and home. “I accidentally called Jim who had recently changed to Janine, a he, and that’s when I was ostracised from everyone. It was confusing because he came in to the office one day dressed as a woman. Oh shit, I did it again, I mean she came into the office dressed as a woman.” The Californian body that deals with transgender matters, the Democrat party, was on hand to further Mr. Pevensey’s outsider status in the state. “We have ordered all people to ignore this man completely if he does not adhere to our rules and regulations. He has also been disowned by his own dog which we took into the dog pound yesterday. His kids do not talk to him and his ex-wife has been given 100% of the house.” Even the previously friendly staff at the man’s local Trader Joe’s store now ignore him completely. Subsequently, the Daily Squib was told by Californian legislatures that if we posted this article about the ignored man we would be ignored too. That’s okay folks, we’re ignored anyway so it don’t matter.",1
"YouTube staff coming into work today after the tragic shooting yesterday. One day after the horrendous shooting by a crazed videologger, YouTube staff were bused in to their California campus. The convoy of heavily armoured vehicles began the journey 40 miles away and made its way slowly to the YouTube offices. Police escorts and SWAT teams were on standby, and people even lined the streets to see the spectacle. “Look up there. There’s a helicopter, AWACS and a few drones,” Jon Trench, 34, a local butcher said pointing up. Many of the staff bused in under armoured cover are known YouTube censors so this is why Google is not taking any chances. Security was so tight in the HQ today that if you even dropped a pin on the floor, fifty armed guards were on standby to surround you with automatic weapons pointed at your head. “We’re not taking any chances anymore. I guess what goes around comes around. Censor enough people and one of them’s going to be a psychotic nut with a vendetta,” one YouTube employee said from under his balaclava. Many hated YouTube staff are now in fear for their lives because it is easy to find out where they live. Thousands of former Tubers have had their livelihoods destroyed by being censored and demonetised by the biased censors, so there is definitely no shortage of angry people out there.",1
"Anti-gun campaigner, Piers Moron Piers Moron, former Daily Mirror editor, and anti-gun campaigner when he was in America, has now called for a gun ban in London. The spate of vicious murders in the capital city, are a serious cause for concern for anti-gun campaigners. “We need to ban guns in London especially because they’re using Ak47 assault rifles, automatic pistols and all sorts of guns to murder people,” Moron said from the safety of his Cotswolds mansion cottage. Anti-gun campaigners are now petitioning the government to ban guns in the UK, because gun control really works. Ban them now. I am sure if you ban guns all the gun murders will stop “We need to say to these people. Put down your guns. There is no need to shoot someone. All these people really need is to sit down and have a nice cup of tea and a happy conversation with someone. Guns are not the answer. Ban them now. I am sure if you ban guns all the gun murders will stop,” Moron added. Meanwhile, the capital city’s Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan, said…nothing.",1
"Piccadilly Circus, London, England Whenever London has a Labour Mayor, murders spike, but this week under the expert Labour leadership of Sadiq Khan it dropped below 40,000 for the first time since he was in power. Under ‘Red’ Ken Livingstone, the stabbings were so prolific that Londoners would only venture out into the streets under armed guard protection, today, it’s a lot better, you only need a stab proof vest. Statistics show that Tuesday last week saw a slight drop and only 40,000 fatalities from murder occured. Londoner, Ed Corn, 45, says he only got stabbed three times on one day, and was appreciative of the gesture. “I only got stabbed three times. One in the left buttock, one just above my liver, and the other a mere slash of the throat. Just missed the jug. It has been like a holiday for me. I actually feel relieved.” Labour’s London is a dirty cesspit of violence and hatred Arthur Grenfell, said that living in the capital he was all too appreciative of the current situation: “Living in London these days, an overcrowded cesspit of shit where every road space is filled with useless bus lanes, bike lanes and lanes for mobility scooters. The buses come in sevens and are always empty, churning out vile fumes into every pore of your body and up your filthy nostrils. The rude Eastern Europeans all with their unregistered vehicles hog the roads and pavements fearless of ever getting a ticket. There are no road rules any more, there is no highway code, that went many years ago. The air smells like a festering tramp’s fresh diarrhoea explosion in your local library. London today is an expensive toilet where people pay through the nose to live in tiny squalid houses if you can call them that, they pay through the nose to work in the capital, and invariably, they pay to die in it too.” Life in the capital today under Labour is such hell that getting stabbed or shot by a Yardie wannabe is actually a relief. “I was shot four times on Thursday buying some jam from the local Sklep. It was a relief actually because eventually when the ambulance came six hours later, they took me to a hospital 250 miles away from London. They said there were no beds in the hospitals across the capital, apparently its a new EU initiative where they bring in millions of people from the poorest countries in the world to use up our resources. Anyway, I’m glad to be out of it,” Reggie Carbuncle, 65, said from the operating theatre just before having his kidneys removed due to the attack. Those were the last words the poor blighter said.

"In the past, the youth protested to gain more freedom. Today, they protest to have their freedoms taken away. To protest against the right to defend oneself or one’s family is the sort of deranged state the youth are in today. These indoctrinated lemmings seem to be reading from someone’s script, and they do not really know what they are saying or what freedom fundamentally means. Propaganda crisis-porn Actors in the current chess game, pawns like Hogg, a jumped up little turd who is so autocued you might as well see the strings controlling him as the puppeteers sneer insanely behind the scenes. What’s more, the likes of CNN and MSNBC giving this fucking boil on the arse of humanity air time and demagogue status stinks to high heaven. “These are children. Brainwashed children doing the bidding of their masters. Hogg, is a dastardly yellow stained twink, hogtied by his controllers, told to bend over and take the big one for the money. Superstardom for the little squirt as he spits his fake Goebbels anecdotes, raises his outstretched hand whilst spouting scripted stories to a cheering Jugend audience,” one commentator revealed. Another observer observed: “Fundamentally these kids have grown up in a dumbed-down time. They cannot have a thought for themselves, they do not know how to function without someone telling them how to think. Their indoctrination is so ingrained, that it is scientifically impossible to undo the damage. They have grown up with no privacy, or freedom, so who can blame them when they march to take away the hard fought freedoms that soldiers in both world wars died to protect.” The sickening sound of brainwashed chants coming from the very well organised and funded rallies, does not look like a real spontaneous rally where people do something out of genuine emotion, instead it looks like carefully choreographed crisis-porn. Certain agencies have certainly capitalised on tragic school shootings to manipulate these poor misguided children into an ongoing agenda.",1

"Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knackers yard If one ever needed proof that the Theresa May Remainer led EU single market Brexit Only by Name was in place, the fact that she is not triggering Article 127 by today’s deadline is it.

"You will give up your guns America, you will.. Analysing the current socialist media push in America to repeal the Second Amendment is a sad affair. Here we have the networks on 24 hour shifts pushing out anti-gun propaganda on a constant loop, that is frankly tiresome and old. Then we have the university students, indoctrinated by their Marxist professors, and to top it all off, there’s the tech companies and social media effect where paid Soros shills as well as Chinese globalist operatives constantly bleed out the anti-second amendment narrative. How do you destabilise a country from within? Divide it of course, and this is what China along with Russia are trying to do. Consider the fact, would you want a fully armed up population against you in any invasion? In Switzerland, it is mandatory that every citizen is armed, and this provides a good incentive to not invade. The collective moaning and sulking is not only tiresome to watch, but pitiful. It is however a technique used time and time again to change the views of the masses who are targeted. Amongst the useless marches and lie-ins, nothing is achieved. No gun legislation will ever be achieved by peaceful means in the U.S, so these misguided idiots are rallying just for the sake of rallying. Why not make it a day out in Washington D.C, see the sights, buy that smelly hotdog, then jump on the bandwagon for a few hours listening to communist speakers rally the useless troops? After the Obama Marxist reign, American socialists are even more of a joke, and to see them so triggered is proof that the majority are very easily controlled by their controllers. Most of the protesters who shout for the ban of the AR-15 do not even know that it is a semi-automatic (i.e. it can only make one shot at a time). Fully automatic AR-15s are now banned, but this passes by the deranged ill informed protesters who hold their placards up simply to feel like they are part of a crowd. If they knew they were marching for China, maybe they would think again, however many would probably appreciate the communist sentiment. Similar to sheep and lemmings, the socialists calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, are following a mantra they simply do not understand, and they are completely clueless as to who is pulling the strings behind the scenes. Banning does nothing First of all, banning guns does nothing, because then you have illegal weapons, and the trade for those will increase exponentially. Much like the drug trade, if one bans something, it gains value. Traffickers are begging for gun control, because that means they will have sole distribution rights. One only has to look at Prohibition in the 1920s. The Mafia made billions in today’s money after alcohol was banned in the United States for a period of time. Secondly, why stop at guns? Cars kill, knives kill and if you do it right so can a ballpoint pen. Do you want these things banned too? Thirdly, trying to take away a real Americans’ gun is akin to taking away their right to defend themselves or their families. This right is so ingrained in American society and culture that it will take a civil war to achieve. Naturally, the first people who will be shot in an another American civil war will be the dweebs who don’t like guns and protested against them. What do you think will happen when every gun toting American suddenly wakes up to what is happening? It’s gonna be trigger time. A lot of Americans are positively itching for the gun grab to happen, because they know where the unarmed anti-gun people live. Civil war would be like hunting season all over again, except this time substitute the jack rabbit for the Hogg stooge and his brainwashed commie compatriots. Looting, fucking, shooting, and cold blooded murder, the whole shithouse will go up in flames overnight. Like lighting a match under a firework factory, astronauts will be able to watch the whole shooting spree from the space station all the way up there in orbit. As for the U.K, banning guns was no big deal simply because it never had a gun culture ingrained as much as Americans. The docile British are so well controlled that they happily pay as much tax as possible without even complaining. In America, that just would not stand, and the people would make things happen one way or another. The exact is opposite in the U.K. where every indignity and non-freedom is accepted willingly by the populace without so much as a whimper. America was built by the gun. Maybe, it will die by the gun.",1
"Former Soviet-era spy, Agent Cob, aka Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour party, has revealed his vehement anti-semitism to his followers. Speaking from his dacha in New Malden, the ex-spy revealed his final solution for the Jews. “Stalin, is a great hero of mine. He put millions of Jews into the gulags in Siberia where they perished from hard work and certain starvation. When I am leader, I will solve the Jew problem by putting them all in gulags in Northern Britain, which some say is a worse fate than being in Siberia.” The Great Purge Now that Labour is aligned with anti-semitic policies, when it gets into power, it will purge Britain of Jews as it views them as zionist infiltrators to the Soviet British cause. Momentum, a radical arm of the Labour party will spearhead the purge initiative, by disseminating anti-Jewish propaganda. The Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn will thus rid Britain of Jews, such is their vitriol and hatred towards them. Much like Stalin, who murdered millions of Jews, so too will Corbyn follow in his steps. After the foundation of Israel in May 1948, and its alignment with the USA in the Cold War, the 2 million Soviet Jews, who had always remained loyal to the Soviet system, were portrayed by the Stalinist regime as a potential fifth column and labelled Enemy of the People. Despite his personal dislike of Jews, Stalin had been an early supporter of a Jewish state in Palestine, which he had hoped to turn into a Soviet satellite in the Middle East. But as the leadership of the emerging state proved hostile to approaches from the Soviet Union, Stalin became increasingly afraid of pro-Israeli feeling among Soviet Jews. His fears intensified as a result of Golda Meir’s arrival in Moscow in the autumn of 1948 as the first Israeli ambassador to the USSR. On her visit to a Moscow synagogue on Yom Kippur, thousands of people lined the streets, many of them shouting Am Yisroel chai (‘The people of Israel live!’)—a traditional affirmation of national renewal to Jews throughout the world but to Stalin a dangerous sign of ‘bourgeois Jewish nationalism’ that subverted the authority of the Soviet state. Stalin’s response was to remove many prominent Jews from public office, albeit quietly, and send thousands to gulags where they simply disappeared. The irony is that it was the Jewish Bolsheviks who had played a very important role in the Soviet cultural revolution in the first place, however under Stalin, they were now deemed the Enemy of the People. He also made sure that any cultural references to Jewish people or the state of Israel would be shut down, including museums and cultural centres. Much like Stalin, Corbyn detests anything that is linked with Western democracy, and it is unfortunate for the Jews that they are a scapegoat now as much as in Stalin’s day.",1
"Sometimes satire melts into real life news, and these days this phenomenon is all too common, especially when it comes to the French sensibility. Here we have a news story of a Canadian restaurant firing a perfectly good French waiter simply because he was way too French for their liking. In alleging discrimination Rey said French culture just “tends to be more direct and expressive.” He owes his sacking to his “direct, honest and professional personality,” which he acquired while training in France’s hospitality industry. North Americans and Canadians (even French Canadians) simply do not understand what French manners are like. In Paris, if a waiter spits in your soup just as he is to serve it to you, that is considered a considerable compliment. He will do this while eyeing up your girlfriend or wife, and giving her his phone number. In France, not an eyelid is batted by the locals to such behaviour. For Parisian waiters, to be rude, offhand, aggressive and downright arrogant is just a way of life, it is a form of expressionistic painting, the joie de vivre without life’s enjoyment but sheer purpose in serving the customer their overpriced haute cuisine slop. “For tourists, we put on a show for them. Especially the Japanese ones who have this idealistic view of France, you know cobbled streets, a beret carrying a baguette under the arm. We insult these cochons then charge them through the roof, and they love it, when they leave traumatised for life,” a particularly arrogant Parisian waiter recently revealed. ",1
"Stormy Daniels First go to the Stormy video and press play to listen before reading this article President Donald Trump is in a stormy situation and is consulting veteran musician Carlos Santana about it. “I like his music, and even though he’s a Mexican chicano he can play a mean guitar, you know how he makes the PRS wail like a moaning woman I just grabbed by the …” Carlos in his retirement sits in his Las Vegas mansion watching the weather channel all day, and was surprised to get a call from the Donald asking for advice.

You need longer hair man, acts like an antenna to the universal mind. Plus, reef. You need the reefer or a few tabs to get the real vibrations to life and all the answers to the questions…oh, and while he’s doing this he gotta wear a hat, that bit muy muy importante.” Whether President Trump will adhere to Santana’s advice is still to be seen.",1
"Indoctrinated socialist millennials stage a lie-in at the White House to protest gun laws on February 19, 2018 in Washington DC Gun control is a serious fact of life. If you are holding your prize Deagle primed with some .50 AE ammo and you can’t control the recoil, you might as well be pissing in the wind, this is why you need gun control. You empty a clip, your reload time may be a life or death situation, this is why you need to reload fast, and have many magazines available for the next burst of fire, this is all about gun control. Collateral damage, this is acceptable in the military but on the streets or home can get you locked up for good, therefore when you’re aiming, get the right target (the bad guy) for fuck’s sake. Gun control is a very important aspect of this situation otherwise you could end up with multiple instances of collateral damage. What about jamming? If your weapon of choice is not properly maintained, cleaned and oiled, then you will get more instances of your firearm jamming due to fouling. You don’t want that to happen if you’re in a serious life threatening situation and firing a fully automatic or semi auto weapon. Revolvers are generally more reliable, but they still need to be maintained and under gun control. Gun control is also about what gauge you use with your weapon. What can you handle well? Know your limits. It’s a toss up between blowing major holes in somebody or something or getting that accurate clean head shot into the cranium with little or no recoil. Practice, practice, practice! If you don’t practice with your gun, you won’t know how to control the gun. This is why access to a good shooting range is invaluable. Don’t forget, gun control is not only about controlling the gun but most of all controlling yourself. If someone cuts in line at the fast food restaurant, just let it go, sure you can say a few words, maybe have a fist fight, but no guns will be needed there. Gun control is mostly about responsibility. You should only ever use your weapon when in serious fear of your life, and mostly on your own property to protect your family and yourself. Hopefully with these tips, you will adhere to good gun control and live a long happy life of liberty including the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. Remember, the founding fathers wrote the Second Amendment for a very good reason, and that was to protect you the citizen, not only from daily crimes, but from any tyrannical government that may ever pop up.

"O nline casinos popularity is practically through the roof, and players are constantly looking for ways to spice up their game play experience. Considering that it’s human nature to strive for greater interaction, online casino platform providers have managed to identify several ways to retain and increase player traffic. Live dealer games offer the ultimate level of interactivity with the remaining participants, i.e. the game dealer and the remaining players on your table. If you haven’t experienced the live dealer games available online, you should know to expect a real-life person and table transmitted onto your computer screen instead of the usual graphic design setup. How Do Live Dealer Casino Games Work? In order to function optimally, the live dealer game selection at online casinos does not depend on the same operator. Namely, this technology is still developing and improving, which is why there are only a handful of third-party live dealer game software providers that regulate all its settings and technical support. In terms of requirements, live dealer casino games may be said to be somewhat demanding, even though players using an average computing setup could access and enjoy them. Mobile online casino players, however, are still unable to access live dealer casino games properly, as currently manufactured mobile devices don’t have enough bandwidth to run and support them. This means that you will be able to enjoy such entertainment at the comfort of your own home, or any place that allows you to take your laptop. Regardless of the location and device you choose, there is one criterion that needs to be met in order to ensure the games will run smoothly – the players’ Internet connection. It is highly advisable to use Wi-Fi as a connection, but only from a reliable and secure provider, and ensure that high volumes of traffic are available, as it can use up to a few GBs from your monthly subscription. Which Types of Live Dealer Casino Games Are Available? So far, not all casino games have been adapted to the live dealer mode, but those that have been are blackjack, roulette, baccarat and poker. Blackjack games have no trouble attracting online casino players, but this live mode is definitely ‘the real deal’. Live blackjack is played using actual card decks, which are shuffled in a real life shoe, and dealt by a dealer. Should you have a few blackjack strategies up your sleeve, live dealer blackjack is the best place to use them as it provides the least chance for others to note them. Live dealer roulette is available in all its standard versions – European, American and, on some occasions French Roulette, which offers the best odds for its players due to the number of characteristic betting possibilities. Baccarat is also suited to this specific format, especially since dealing and betting moves are applied without anyone noticing that you still haven’t handled all the rules. As for poker, Texas Hold’em is arguably the most popular variant, but as live dealer games are progressing, so is the number of poker game types available in this format.",1
"As the exodus of white farmers continues from South Africa, the country is descending back to the law of the jungle. South Africa reports that 400 white farmers have been killed in the past 12 months and they were also being forced off their land, as a new policy was implemented through African National Congress (ANC) and its new leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The real Wakanda A motion passed in the South African parliament recently calls for the expropriation of land without compensation of white farmers. Many white farmers are now trying to flee to Australia from South Africa. One fleeing farmer said anonymously: “Once all white farmers go, they won’t know how to run the farms and will probably starve. Good luck to them.”",1
"D onald J Trump has finally clamped down on communist regime China, a brutal totalitarian country that tortures its citizens mercilessly, genocide of millions of Tibetans, has no copyright recognition, and has been booming economically from unjust tariff trade deals. China is a serious threat to Western democracy and needs to go back to its 1970 poverty. Here is a communist country that utilised capitalist systems to gain great wealth, albeit from a skewed tariff trade system heavily in favour of China The devious Chinese in consort with suitably aligned U.S. entities tried to use the ensuing wealth to spread communist ideology by stealth. This is why U.S tech monopolies in consort with China’s communist ideology (Google, Twitter and Facebook) have been pushing Chinese censorship techniques in the West today. Chinese brutality Apart from the brutal dictatorship that knows no human rights or law, China is knockoff central, where they take products from the West then copy them without any form of copyright reciprocation. China has been getting away with their economic murder for too long, by utilising slave labour to make Western products undercutting American workers. One has to also acknowledge that the previous socialist administrations were the ones pushing for China to be America’s factory. China has also infiltrated every business in America and even many universities have seen funding come from China. This is why America is now fighting back from Chinese infiltration into Hollywood; into American universities, into American institutions, into American business. Communist China is a cancer Send the money back. No more economic rape of America will be tolerated. Global communism has today taken a step back. China is a cancer to true democratic globalism, and this cancer like big fat pulsating tumour must be stopped from spreading. The Chinese ploy of spreading communism through the economic backdoor has now backfired. Fuck communist China. The only thing you stand for is brutal torture, censorship, dictatorship and other totalitarian communist ideals.",1
"A nod to the great Duane.. F or American invitees to the wedding of his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales and Ms. Meghan Markle at the chapel in Windsor Castle, these careful words of advice are hereinafter given to provide some pointers to avoid gaffes on your part. “Hi, buddy” is not considered a proper greeting to the Prince, nor “Hi, there” to Meghan. With the British, first names are not used at once as if you are drinking pals. In the case of the Prince and Meghan, this means you cannot address them as “Harry” and “Meghan” (let alone, “Har” and “Meg”). If the conversation becomes boring, it is not considered normal behavior to begin fingering objects at the reception and checking their bottoms for prices. An occasional nod of the head will give the impression of paying attention. Appraising the women’s legs is a no-no. When tea is served, as it invariably is, it will be brought in a cup. Nor should the saucer which accompanies the cup be considered an unnecessary accoutrement; the saucer should not be waived away with distain, nor should you say you prefer “a brew” instead. The little finger should not be pointed (and certainly never at the prince or the bride) but curled in raising the cup, and the index finger should not be extended in lieu thereof, even in emphasizing a conversational point. Actually, points are not emphasized in England, rather they are nudged into place. Napkins are also served, and the mouth should be patted, never swiped at. Sweeping gestures are frowned on. The last sweeping gesture made by an Englishman was that of Sir Walter Raleigh in spreading his cloak for Queen Elizabeth (the First) to walk on, and he subsequently lost his head. The English are a reticent race. Do not pepper them with a lot of rapid-fire talk. On the other hand, you may doze until they finish their sentences, and mumbling is also tolerated, which facilitates answering them if you are in the midst of a tart which the English dote on. Do not ask for a Big Mac instead. The English cannot abide shouting, so your normal speaking voice must be modulated. An alternative technique is to stand further back from your conversant than you do in the U.S. This can only enhance your status, as the English frown on familiarity. Do not worry that you will not be heard, for many Englishmen are equipped with ear-trumpets, a habit no doubt stemming from their use as mouth-trumpets during fox hunts. Touching the English when speaking with them is absolutely forbidden. This touchiness derives (in the case of males) from their public school days, in which such physicality was regarded as a discreet overture. When presented to an Englishman, especially if titled, it is not considered proper to thereupon inquire as to his salary or the cost of his residence, nor even (if it is not abundantly clear) what he does for a living. Many titled Englishman do nothing for a living, nor are they expected to. Caveat: If you are presented to a Lord, do not commence to mention your own favorite schemes for investment. Don’t try to purchase London Bridge as a souvenir. Finally, a general rule: when in doubt, adopt passivity. This may prolong your visit unintentionally a few weeks until your hosts take the initiative, but they will regard you forever after as the most decent of chaps. A final suggestion, do not call the Queen, “Queenie.” This guest article was submitted by a genuine American",1
"Where will this mass censorship drive by left wing tech companies end? The internet is slowly being purged of free thought and freedom of expression by monopoly companies that control 95% of everything now on the world wide web. All there is is silence. No one apart from a few sites and people are speaking up or doing anything about it. Well if you don’t stand up for your rights, then one day you will be next, one day you will be censored, demonetized and deleted, or relegated to page 3,000 in search. Who will speak up for you then? NO ONE! As well as Martin Niemöller’s words that ring so true in this insane Orwellian age, we can also mention Edmund Burke who famously stated — “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” How ironic that Google once said that it’s motto was: “Don’t be Evil” Just as Google has censored our satire and parody so too is China. In retrospect, what is happening right now is beyond evil, because what these monopoly tech companies and their extreme leftist policies are doing is in fact aligning with communist Chinese censorship and its destructive dictatorial ideology. And here we thought we lived in a functioning Western democracy where we had rights of free speech? Alas, the tech companies like twitter, facebook and google have demonstrated otherwise by inhibiting our fundamental rights to human expression and freedom. THIS WILL NOT END WITH US – YOU ARE NEXT Our brand of Juvenalian satire has been punished so severely that we can barely write anything or post a picture without Google punishing our site. Such are the lengths they go to to censor satire, a literary genre borne from the beginning of mankind’s history. How would Decimus Iūnius Iuvenālis have dealt with the Google push against real satire and free speech on the internet? No doubt, he would have reacted with great disgust. Not only at the punishers of free speech but at the media companies, the authors, the writers, the politicians and supposed guardians of democracy who are NOW silent. Even so-called upholders of investigative journalism and satire, Private Eye, who are now merely establishment BBCified stooges towing the line are silent. You are pathetic in your silence, but one day, you may hark back to this moment and realise you were wrong and cowardly. Berners Lee? Where is he? Nowhere to be seen. All we know is, the Daily Squib stood up. We will fight them to the end, to the end of the universe, to the end of time, and to the end of every sinew, every muscle group and every fucking last drop of our spittle for our right to write satire and parody. cartoon: Damien Glez http://glez.org/",1
"Protesters have flung a big flapping wet fish into the River Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament this morning in a demonstration against the Government’s Brexit transition deal. Fishermen and Tory MPs took part in the protest after the Government caved to demands from Brussels that Britain remain in the Common Fisheries Policy until 31 December 2020. The climbdown over the transition deal means that the UK will be subject to quotas imposed on British fishermen from the EU for an additional 21 months. Setting off shortly after 8am, the fishing vessel HMS Brexit set sail under Tower Bridge towards Parliament, carrying more than a dozen journalists and fishermen ready to fling the wet fish into the Thames. Sold Britain down the river “She kept trying to justify capitulating to Brussels and being a wet fish. She’s sold us all down the river with this terrible transition deal which will see our fishermen scuppered,” a protester said before the flinging commenced. Just like everything else, wet fish, Theresa May was pathetic even to the end, and as the Tories and fishermen lifted her up, she blubbed like a soppy sodden sponge. With an almighty splash, the wet fish first sank, then rose, drowned, floating silently down the river that has for centuries been the heart and soul of the capital.",1
"Ooh la la! Mon dieu! Is it true, oui, c’est vrai! Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, has been put behind bars in prison. Sarkozy is in custody as part of an investigation that he received millions of euros in illegal financing from the regime of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, according to a judicial source. “I told him, he needs to clean the money. Sarko, would not listen to me and deposited the millions in a French bank. He thought he was untouchable because he was part of the French elite,” a former associate revealed. Though an investigation has been underway since 2013, the case gained traction some three years later when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told the online investigative site, Mediapart, that he delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff Claude Gueant. Investigators are examining claims that Gadhafi’s regime secretly gave Sarkozy 50 million euros overall for the 2007 campaign. Such a sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time of 21 million euros. In addition, the alleged payments would violate French rules against foreign financing and declaring the source of campaign funds. French prisons are full to the brim of young African men who have not had a piece of ass for a long time, so Sarkozy will be fresh white meat thrown to the dogs. “He better not pick up the soap in the showers,” a former inmate revealed.",1
"Hormones are chemicals produced by the body. They are very small, however powerful, and lack or excess of them can cost one health. Hormones directly influence the majority of organs and tissues, physical and chemical processes, even state of mind and emotions. For example, the most powerful hormones in the human body are: Adrenaline; Testosterone, Human Growth Hormone; Estrogen; Insulin; Cortisol. When these or other hormones are disbalanced, hormone replacement therapy is one of the treatment options. Hormones can be provided in pills, injections, patches, etc. While some people believe that having a diagnosis and knowing what hormone is lacking or in excess is enough to go an buy a medicine on their own, this is totally incorrect. To provide proper treatment, years of experience and profound knowledge in medical field are needed. So, to buy proper pills, patches or injections, go to https://www.hgha.com/ and consult a doctor first. it may even turn out that what you believe is endocrine system problem is actually not, and additional intake of hormones will ruin your health even more. Why You Can’t Get Injection Of Your Own Choice In order to attract clients, pharmaceutical companies started to produce different injections that aim to increase the level of certain hormone in the body. The patients who need injections can theoretically buy those and do injections at home, without need to visit the clinic. However, these injections are and should be sold only after proper research, analysis and calculation of dosage. Here are some reasons why you should not get injections without doctor’s prescription: To decide what injection is correct, the doctor has to make a full medical screening. In order to improve the level of hormone in the body, any injection dosage is not the option. The processes can only be changed in a needed way if the components of injection correspond to particular body needs. You can’t calculate the dosage yourself. General prescriptions are not enough. Each patient’s endocrine profile is different. You have to consult the doctor if you want to get the medicine that will really help you. The efficiency and influence of hormones should be constantly supervised and the indications should be measured, to check the progress and adjust the treatment plan if needed. The dosage may need to be changed already in two weeks, or another medication should be offered. Without proper education and experience, a patient cannot conduct such observation. These reasons show that you can only get the injections by doctor’s prescription. Otherwise, you will simply ruin your health. What Doctor To Address Not all endocrinologists who work in clinics are able to prescribe the right hormone treatment, in other words, only being a doctor in a clinic is not enough. A professional doctor has to have years of practice in the field, having worked specifically as endocrinologist. The doctor also has to have appropriate certification from relevant authorities confirming him as a specialist. medical diploma is not yet an indicator of proper knowledge and skills. It is always a good idea to ask your friends about contacts of a good doctor; the word of mouth is a good recommendation in this case. If the doctor or clinic is awful, people will readily tell you so. The treatment methods, medications and approaches also develop constantly. The scientists discover new options, and modern doctors have to be posted about the innovations. Pharmaceutical companies develop new products that have to be checked, tested, certified, assessed, modified, and doctors take part in all that, too. Therefore, the doctor has to be really experienced to provide proper diagnosis, treatment plan and patient support. Choose your doctor and clinic wisely.",1
"Who would have thought, the supreme Vlad, has won another election. Much like Robert Mugabe, no doubt the Russians are keen followers of the Zimbabwe election winning technique during the ‘good old days’. To celebrate, the Russian leader has gone to town with some extra botox sessions to puff out his face further. Putin’s clinic is of course sworn to secrecy, but the pictures do not lie. The Russian despot’s eyebags now make his face look so puffed up, he resembles a smiling Cheshire cat in every photo. “Along with his glass of polonium which he drinks every day, our supreme leader, Czar Puto, undergoes botox treatment for his face. He looks wonderful afterwards,” a lying official said on Tuesday. Another official opined, “At least he doesn’t look like Jocelyn Perisset Wildenstein…..yet.” ",1
"Jeremy Corbyn (Agent Cob) pictured outside the FSB Lubyanka building in Meshchansky District of Moscow, Russia. October, 2017 Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to move the current Manchester Labour HQ to Moscow, Russia has come under scrutiny from some Labour MPs. Speaking at the Manchester HQ, Reggie Dwumble, MP for South Lanarkshire, was slightly precarious about the move. “Jeremy said that we would all have to speak Russian. There are so many Russians in Britain today, that’s the only language I usually hear when in the streets, but I can’t learn it. To me it sounds like someone who has marbles permanently stuck in their throat.” The move to Moscow, planned for June, 2018, will involve every item within the HQ shipped to Russia. The Labour party has secured the correct papers for the transfer, and were given fast lane status by the Russian consulate. Vladimir Sikorsky, a Russian embassy envoy was on hand to explain the fine details of the move. “You need hats. In Moscow it very cold. Also, you need to be able to drink large quantities of vodka without falling down. Us Russian, we can drink three bottles a day without getting tipsy, but you British will have to learn the Russian way. Also, you have to know about food shopping, in our shops food very expensive, only VIP oligarch can shop there. In some Moscow markets, one tomato is equivalent to £7.50.” Jeremy Corbyn, however, has sought to calm the nerves of his staff and followers. “Comrades, as your supreme Agent Cob, I wish to assuage any form of terror you may be feeling right now when I announced the Moscow move. Remember that I am doing this to get back to our roots, and also because I’m a commie bastard who subscribes to Marxist ideology.”",1
"This week’s twitter hashtag trend has shown a movement away from the victim-led #MeToo tag that had women crying about things like someone asking them out on a date, to hashtags like #YouAsWell, #WhoCares and #GetOverYourself which dealt with people who are fed up of the hysteria. One twitter user, 98Arbunkin was certain that the #MeToo generation of #snowflakes were more of a danger to themselves with their constant moaning and groaning. “Why don’t they just shut up. If you have a legitimate problem, or someone has seriously done you wrong, molested you, raped you, go to the police. Don’t write it on twitter. We don’t care anymore. Get over yourselves for fuck’s sake.” Professor Giles Timberlik, a social media expert at the University of Kentucky Fry in Austin, Texas, has conducted data driven studies into the #MeToo phenomenon of caterwauling women. “It’s simply a way for the hysterical bags of oestrogen to moan about men by using twitter to put the spotlight on the person who uses the hashtag to moan about men. Like look at me I am one of you, I don’t like men either. Hey, look at my profile. Look at me. Look at my beautiful assortment of selfies.” Attention whores This is why paying attention to the #metoo posters is adding fuel to the fire. It is in fact taking women’s rights back to the stone age. “I just won’t employ women any more. It’s that simple. I need people that work, don’t get pregnant and don’t moan about the simplest of things like complimenting her, or asking her out on a date. If they don’t want to be employed, it’s their problem, not mine,” a video production suite manager, who deals with many Hollywood productions told LAWeek magazine. Women who profit from their looks should deal with the fact that they are using their looks to make money, and they are attractive to men. Mosher Libavitz, an agent who caters for Hollywood celebrities is just as sick of #metoo as everyone else. “I see actresses come here, tits hanging out, a dress up to her waist, and they complain to me that men look at them. She said she posted #metoo in disgust. Then she got down on both knees in my office and asked if I got her a part in the latest Spielberg film, she will do this, and that, licking her lips. I said, okay, then after she finished I told her to leave. She did not get the part, so then she posts on twitter that I raped her,” Mr. Libavitz said from jail yesterday.",1
"It has been a nightmare 24 hours for Agent Cob (aka Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn). First he was told that the security forces were on to his double dealing with the Russians, then his own party started to question his soviet orders. Here is an agent who prided himself in his meticulous espionage techniques of hiding under plain sight, exposed for the whole world to see. Issuing a statement to the House of Commons, Agent Cob was adamant that he was innocent to all accusations of spying for the Russians. “I am not a spy. I have not handed secrets or any form of information to the Russians, now or at any time in the past,” Agent Cob said emphatically. Then someone in the audience coughed loudly whilst uttering the word “Bullshit!”. Tenterhooks It is yet to be seen whether Agent Cob will be expelled back to Russia, as he may abscond and disappear once again into the unknown to continue plotting his return. MI6 operative, St John Sinclair, (Agent 00x) has other thoughts. “Agent Cob has been responsible for many leaks that have compromised British national security. If he won’t go back to Russia after being expelled, we’ll just have to get Q branch onto him. They have many contraptions that can delete Agent Cob without even a trace. We are certainly not as messy as our Russian friends when it comes to erasing erroneous assets.”",1
"The majority of military Russians, except for a few portions still subscribe to the old Soviet conscript model and are seriously lax in modern fighting methods or equipment. This is why a ground war with Russia would be a fait accomplis for the crumbling old facade of the poverty stricken rabble that is the Russian army. Yes, Putin can always threaten complete nuclear annihilation of the earth with his grandiose killer missiles, but even he does not want that. His aim, even if it is deluded, is to conquer the West intact so he can be the ultimate Czar of the world with Russian supremacy over all. Modernization needs money, and this is where Russia ultimately falls down. The country, now an International pariah, is sanctioned to the hilt, and its primary revenue streams are diverted by corrupt oligarchs offshore. “Our unit has two rifles to practice with. I asked my commanding officer what would happen in combat, and he told me that we would have to share the old Soviet rifles together, maybe one chap takes a shot, then another might think he can do better. So you pass the rifles around the unit, or if someone is killed and he is holding the rifle, you pick it up and carry on until the whole unit perishes,” Sergei Olkov, a private in Russia’s second division stationed in the Northeastern Group in the Kamchatka Peninsula revealed. To go into battle with today’s modern forces would mostly be suicide for the poor Russian conscripts, who are so ill trained, they don’t even have the capacity to understand the basic battle tactics or maneuvers most other forces utilise to win over the enemy. Only about a quarter of Russian ground forces are fully staffed, well-trained professional troops. The rest are a mishmash of units put together, some don’t even have uniforms, and serve in their tracksuits. They have never even fired live weapons or had access to specialist military equipment. One only has to look at the graveyard of Afghanistan to see the abandoned Soviet tanks and Migs, revealing the realities of how poorly performing the Russians were even when fighting old men in huts carrying 19th century single shot rifles. “The Russian boys would be seen frolicking around in their camps, they run around naked, drunk, slapping each others butts, and doing god knows what to each other. When they came out to patrol once a week, I would shoot one round into the sky. Then they would run away with real fear in their eyes. To us, these were not men but girls,” a Pashtun warrior chief, recalled. Naturally, Putin only sent the cream of the crop to the recent Syrian conflict as a showcase for the world’s media, however these only make up one percent of the current Russian army. What of the conflict in Ukraine? Putin cannot even advance from the small pockets of land he has illegally occupied, as his troops are so weak. All the talk about Russia this, Russia that. It’s all hysteria, smoke and mirrors. There is no threat from Russia on the ground or in the air. If the West wanted to, they could cut through Russia faster than a babushka cuts through her tepid cabbage soup with a mouldy wooden spoon. How about a trip on the ageing only Russian aircraft carrier, the Soviet-era Admiral Kuznetsov. Basically it is an old rust bucket which breaks down frequently and needs its own tug to tow it back to shore on practically every voyage it goes on. This some say is why Russians drink so much vodka, because inherently they are cowards, and have to be so drunk to even get the guts to pick up a weapon let alone shoot it. ",1
"You ever tried to do a bicycle kick wearing a full Hazmat chemical hazard suit in a World Cup final? Well, the England boys are all suited up and ready for today’s training. Their destination is the 2018 World Cup in Russia, which will be a serious test for the team. After a few minutes, there’s a breakaway, Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool midfielder suddenly checks his run, and parries through an instep drive towards centre. Unfortunately, due to the Hazmat suit, his shot hits a stopper, and the opposing side now delve deep into territorial danger bossing the game. After angling to the sweeper, then square passing to Harry Kane who runs the ball right up to the opposition’s line of retreat just outside the penalty box, he suddenly collapses with extreme heat exhaustion and cannot move. The goalie breathes a sigh of relief. The perils of this dangerous endeavour are ever present. Half the team can barely run for fifteen minutes before suffering from heat exhaustion and fatigue wearing the heavy suits. “It’s hard on the legs especially. Plus you try spitting phlegm in a Hazmat? You can’t spit, you can barely run, and your field of vision is shot to shit,” Jamie Carragher says from the sidelines. It’s half time and the boys are knackered. There’s no way you can eat an orange segment let alone have a smoke in a fucking Hazmat. Second half Gareth Southgate, the manager comes out of his hut at 56 minutes and presses a red button. It’s a chemical nerve agent test to see if the England squad will survive. If they have their Hazmat suits on and in proper nick, then it should be okay. Oh dear, one of the boys goes down, the gas got through a little gap as he didn’t put his head dress on properly. Poor bastard, looks like Rose, Tottenham left-back. He is carted off the pitch twitching like an altar boy in a Catholic church. After a few minutes the medics administer the antidote and the foam stops coming out of his mouth. He’s okay. “I wanted to test the team. What if we’re two goals up on Russia, and they suddenly send in their nerve gas while we’re at the other end of the pitch to the Russian team? This is why it is essential our boys wear these suits. Not only could it save our lives but we could win games whilst under chemical attack, the cowardly Russians are dirty players, but we won’t let them get us,” Southgate later revealed. You’ve got to hand it to the brave players for the England squad. They’re really putting themselves forward for Queen and country.",1
"Scientists for the Agricultural Research Center in Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York, have revealed the shocking findings in a recent research journal posted last week. Professor Haley Baum, has shocked the world’s vegetarians and vegans with the research data. “Our initial analysis process was to determine electrical nano-pulse feedback from plants when harvested from the ground. We found that when a plant is uprooted from the earth it has stood in from seed, the plant lets off a high pitched sound above any human register, along with electrical impulses. This reaction led us to hypothesise that the plant was not happy about being uprooted and was in effect screaming for its life. “We then moved on to vegetables being first cut, then eaten. We attached a series of meters and electrical signal sequencers to each vegetable. The noisiest scream and electrical impulse came from a tomato. Each cut of the blade through its flesh would register a shock impulse denoting extreme distress, then when the tomato was put in the mouth and slowly chewed the distress signal increased until slowly ebbing away. “Bananas being peeled are in pain. It is akin to skinning a living animal. Scraping the skin off carrots, we registered the yelps of pain and distress. Putting fruit in a blender however resulted in no electrical impulse or sound, because death came quickly.” Salad It is thought that meat eaters are the cruel ones, but think about those grapes, maybe that slice of lemon, or that watermelon you just sliced and diced. This new revelation by scientists may change our eating habits forever. Maybe fruit and vegetables will have to be stunned first before meal preparation. Restaurateurs are not happy with the new scientific data. Many who were consulted, said that this would mean many meals for customers would take longer to prepare costing them millions in lost revenue.

"T he creative spirit moves on year after year, yes there are little nuances and subtle refinements but the road is a meandering cornucopia of delights encompassing the International advertising and media scene that encapsulates the magnificent Epica Awards. Since its re-launch in 2012, when it went international for the first time, Epica has grown in prestige. Its winners are now taken into account by most major annual rankings of creativity worldwide, as well as rankings published by individual trade magazines. These include Horizont and Werben & Verkaufen in Germany; Marketing Directo in Spain; Adasia in Singapore; and Strategy in Canada. It is this global International outlook that truly delves into the machinations of the Epica Awards and its inclusive yet exclusive attitude when it comes to the variety of global creative richness. The Epica Awards took its reel of winning work on tour in a series of networking events. The Daily Squib attended the showcase in London on January 31, with a soirée at production company GCRS. Then there was New York on February 27, at Weworks, and Milan on February 23 at the Anteo Palazzo del Cinema. Press coverage in 2017 was extensive, but the Epica Awards in 2018 will no doubt be more pervasive, creating even more of a tectonic buzz around these exclusive awards. Further developments are in place with the Epica Awards. In September, Bloomsbury in London will publish The Epica Book, a glossy coffee table tome containing interviews by major journalists with the world’s creative leaders, plus details of all the winners and selected high-scoring entries. The Epica Awards recently posted its final group of winners after calculating points from the awards show last November. The Holding Company of the Year was Omnicom The Brand of the Year was Nike At the same time, Epica named the best-performing agencies by country and region. Top agencies included J. Walter Thompson in the UK, BETC in France, Heimat in Germany, MRM/McCann in Spain, and Wieden + Kennedy in the Netherlands. In Italy, Verba and Y&R Italy shared the top slot. The most awarded agency in Asia was Cheil Worldwide, Hong Kong; while DDB Argentina took the crown in Latin America The 2018 season opens for entry from July 31st to August 30th.",1
"Western tech companies following China's communist censorship techniques Something has brought forward this thought about the major threat to democracy in the West and the rise of China-led globalism. Recently, the monopolistic tech companies like Google and Facebook started to clamp down on free speech, freedom of expression, satire, and other forms of literature. This totalitarian policy was once only seen in China’s communist dictatorship, and censoring regime. Put two and two together and you have globalism led by China. This means that the tech companies are actually following Chinese communistic techniques in limiting freedom of speech, censorship and dictating what people can and cannot say. Therefore, one can see that there is a shift to soviet communism by the tech companies, who are pandering to China’s globalistic aspirations to take over the West. The tech companies are not doing this only for money, but one suspects that they actually subscribe to Chinese communist doctrine. In relation to the communist doctrine that encapsulates China, some tech companies even happily report dissidents to Chinese authorities. Twitter and Google have both done this, which resulted in the dissidents disappearing, never to be seen again. The Chinese authorities can only get the data about someone’s details, from Twitter or Google, therefore they collaborate with the communist regime in arresting individuals who are critical of the state. China’s awful human rights record is of course glossed over when it comes to profit, and so is the treatment of Tibetans who have been tortured, killed and displaced by the brutal communist Chinese state. Imagine being abducted and whisked away to a cell where you spend the next several months or years with no charge or conviction, and your organs harvested. Communist Chinese brutality puts down any talk of democracy, freedom of expression or free speech. This is very similar to how the Western tech monopolies are acting right now. There can be no globalism with communist China. If this happens, Western democracy loses everything. Amnesty International China ",1

"T oday’s world has no borders. Even if a person physically is not in the same country that his second half or a friend, they can still communicate effectively. No matter how far the people are they still can enjoy each other. In order to facilitate the communication with those who live in different countries, messengers and video chats were developed. Messaging online is quite good. It lets us instantly to send the message to people we love. Though, video chats are even more effective. They let the person to see the other person no matter how far he is. The person simply has to use video chat coomeet to get advanced communication experience. What the Internet Friendship Brings You Getting to know new friends on the Internet is not a regular practice for many people. Some still think you can’t find real emotions online. Though, in reality, the Internet is only another type of space, where feelings can be not less realistic than in real life. Often when people meet online they keep a friendship for many years or even for the whole lifetime. Getting friends online has some important benefits: You can find special people whom you can hardly meet in your regular surrounding. Often people find their second halves online. You can get to know people with different beliefs. On the Internet social, cultural and religious borders do not exist. You can get to know an Indian person who is British. This unique cultural experience is very valuable. You can find people who have similar interest than you do. Often a person who lives in the same surrounding for a lot of time lacks communications. He needs to find new people to share his ideas with. Internet friendship is exactly what is needed. These are the main benefits the Internet friendship provides. Use virtual space for the real benefits. Find interesting people and establish new contacts. Does Fraud on the Internet Exist? One of the main disadvantages of talking to unknown people online is that you can hardly know if you talk to real personalities. Fraud on the Internet is a very normal thing. Though, you can protect yourself from it. In order to do so that you have to choose that communication platforms that check its participants. Such websites oblige people who want to register to present their personal photos and scan versions of passport. That is a very efficient way to check if the person is real or not. Another threat that exists in the virtual space is personal details disclosure. Often in virtual space, the information simply leaks. If you would like to protect your personal data, you need to check Confidentiality policy of a given platform. You should find the clause that states that the web-platform won’t pass your personal details to third parties. Virtual space opens great opportunities. Though, it is important to use it accurately. If the person feels secure, he will use the possibilities the Internet provides extensively. He will be able to find new friends and new impressions.",1
"You gotta hand it to Donald Trump, here is a guy who doesn’t do things by half, he goes in all the way, balls deep, clinking and clanging with those huge balls of steel. By stiffing the Chinese and EU with steel trade tariffs Donald Trump is merely saying, the Communist globalist agenda has to take a back door. Who wants globalism dictated by communist China? The answer is Soros, Obama, the leftists, the EU and China. There is nothing more horrible and ghastly than having the Chinese commie bastards dictating to us what we should do, and this is why having the Don dictate back to them is frankly a breath of fresh air. Globalism should only be completed without a China that is communist. If China dumps communism, then there will be a chance of proper democratic globalism. We cannot have true globalism with a dictatorial communist China and an EU which is a collectivist pseudo-Marxist bloc. We must therefore welcome Brexit, and the American president’s movement to shake up the unfair trade conditions which were running previously in favour of communist China. Communist China, with its awful human rights, its communist dictatorial ideology is counter to globalism, because it is anti-free speech, anti-democracy and anti-freedom of expression.",1
"If things can’t get any worse for Netflix, or the users of the streaming service, former U.S. president, Barack Hussein Obama is going to get a series of shows on the platform to push his agenda down peoples’ throats once again. “This guy is like a dog turd on your shoe that never goes away. You wipe it, you wash it with water, and you drag it along the grass, the turd always stays there and the smell too,” a man, sick to the stomach at the mere thought of Obama propaganda stinking up the network. Maybe Netflix has had its day. Maybe it is time to dump the subscription. People just don’t need this type of propaganda stuffed down their throats day in day out. Some may say, just ignore it, but the notifications keep popping up, watch Obama, watch now. “I thought we got rid of Obama. Everytime I turn on Netflix, the last thing I want to see is his big fat head and his feral wife looking at me. I don’t want to see that guy’s face or his wife’s ugly face period.

"Google Maps has mapped pretty much every part of the world, including under the sea, and space, however the company wants to go one step further — your internal body. Google Maps chief engineer, Rama Bangalawa, wants every global person to have their internal body mapped. “We insert the camera through your rectum. Do not worry, the camera is only 12 inches in diameter and will not be intrusive. Then we push it all around your insides mapping the data which is then publicly available to whoever wants to see it. Like, say I want to see my girlfriend’s left kidney or ovaries, just type it up on our Google Maps app, and you will have all the photos there.” Asked whether the new internal body mapping initiative is a bit intrusive, Google denied any invasion of privacy. “It is our policy to map every part of the globe, and you as a human inhabit that sphere of data input. This is not an invasion of privacy but a right that our company is entitled to.” The body map will go all the way up to the brain. That’s a long way to go from your rectum. Yowzer!",1
"We have been given exclusive access to an Eastern European gang boss who controls vast swathes of Inner City London and the suburbs. Eastern European gangsters are a thriving community who have increased their numbers thanks to the opening of borders under former PM, Tony Blair, in 2004. The brutality and fierceness of these gangsters is legendary, meaning they are practically untouchable by other gangs, and the police. Eastern European criminal gangs specialise mostly in people trafficking, gun running, drugs, prostitution, armed robbery, extortion, kidnapping and digital credit card fraud making their annual tax free takings very lucrative. After many months, we have finally been granted exclusive access to the Eastern European mafia’s Barjak (executive committee), who are one big family (fis), comprising of units led by individual bosses (Kryetars), all answering to the highest boss of bosses.

We are urged to get into the back of the van which travels for approximately 45 minutes until it stops and we hear garage doors opening. My assistant and I are frankly a bit nervous, as we have no idea where we are as the windows in the back of the van have been blacked out. Once we are out of the van, I hear a silenced pistol bang.

"Jeremy Corbyn (Agent Cob) pictured outside the FSB Lubyanka building in Meshchansky District of Moscow, Russia. October, 2017 Former Soviet spy, Jeremy Corbyn, or as he was known ‘Agent Cob‘ could use poison to silence any critics of the Labour manifesto, and he could target opposition MPs if they question his communist ideals, a leading terror expert has revealed. Michael Trimbell, who runs an anti-terror unit for different agencies, has revealed that Agent Cob is “a master in poison techniques, learned from his Cold War days spying for the Russians”. “Russian spies, and Agent Cob’s Czech handler would have trained Agent Cob in various techniques to clandestinely kill adversaries without detection. This included concocting poison from everyday materials, then depositing it in the target’s drink. Agent Cob, would then watch from afar as his mark either keeled over on the spot or swerved around like a drunk. These techniques are utilised by today’s FSB, and yesterday’s KGB very successfully.” KGB operatives could incapacitate opponents by usage of aerosol spray containing lethal cocktails of dangerous toxic gases or from afar with a silent air gun shooting a needle infused with poison into the victim. The tiny needle would enter the skin undetected, then dissolve. Once the poison gets into the bloodstream it kills the victim by stopping the heart, then dissipates without any trace, leaving doctors and forensic scientists labelling the death as a simple natural heart attack. “One minute you’re walking along the High Street, the next your blood pressure drops, and you’re out of breath sweating like a pig. Then your heart stops. Voom! That’s it, and to compound the issue, absolutely no traces of how you died.” MPs in Westminster are naturally quite fearful of Agent Cob, knowing his history and when he is around, they are advised to cover their drinks. “If I see Jeremy shuffling his way around the canteen looking around, I immediately cover my drink. Here is an ex-Soviet spy who leaked secrets to the Soviets in the 1980s, and not only is he among us MPs, he is also the leader of the Labour party. Frankly, I find it exceedingly scary, just the thought that this traitor to Britain is in the Commons looking shifty,” a scared MP who dared to speak of Agent Cob, revealed anonymously.",1
"What’s safe today in the era of bland, Kimmel, puritan, America? Men with no penises. Enter, talkshow host, Jimmy Kimmel, a safe bet for the Oscars, which has now been sanitised, and reduced to a bare shell of puritanical socialist rhetoric that decries masculinity and the biological right of men to own a penis. Propaganda Suffice to say that Kanye West’s mother-in-law has more testosterone than the emasculated mangina, Kimmel, who has ingratiated himself in the ways of soviet-style equality propaganda pushes that are ongoing in social media. Hollywood has thus gone from one extreme to another, from being sexy, to being completely Victorian in its attitude. If one knows their history however, the Victorians indulged in lots of sex in private, however prudish and puritanical they seemed in public. Neutering the essence of Hollywood is thus the role Kimmel has in mind, and he certainly does a good job brown nosing to the Marxist equality commission in charge of emasculating all men in the media. Let us cut off all men’s penises and castrate all men, they cry to loud applause from the compliant drone audience. Well, in that case, you first Jimmy Kimmel, you snivelling yellow gelding, cut off your manhood, and walk the talk.",1
"Angry African illegal immigrants demonstrate their right to illegally immigrate to Italy The EU much like the Mafia, is almost impossible to extricate from. In the Mafia, there are only two ways to exit, death or betrayal and lifelong anonymity looking over your shoulder. The EU, we have seen is much like the same as the Mafiosi. The EU winds and side steps at every point avoiding any form of exit of a country it has imprisoned within its economic steel walls. It is a prison without walls you can see, but the walls are there nevertheless. There is only one way of exiting the EU, that is through non-conformity and disobeying its Stasi rules. That is the only way to go with some form of dignity anyway. Yes, there are other avenues, but these mean that you never leave the strongarm leash of the EU, and are forever tied to its prison rules. The jailers are the unelected European Union officials of the EU Commission, who are pampered denizens of high class escorts, unlimited expense accounts and international luxury travel. Naturally, these elite few at the top enjoy their vast pay packets, their 18-year-old ladies ushered into their hotel rooms, and their daily gourmet food in Europe’s finest restaurants. The members of the EU Commission do not want one of their cash cow countries, which provide good tax revenue, to leave. It is almost like a pimp in a bordello losing one of their working girls, it invariably means a loss of income, and then, what if this sets off others leaving? C’est très dangereux! Es ist sehr gefährlich! To see some dissent now in Italy is a relief, however as it has happened countless times, the dissent will be quashed and the European Union will install their own technocrat to restore rule. Southern Italy has practically been destroyed by mass illegal immigration from Sub Saharan and North Africa. This is the primary reason that the 5Star Movement, has come through so well in the recent election. Whether they will be able to form a legitimate government, coalition or not is a big question, and the EU will be working night and day to thwart this insult to their conquered Italian EU province.

"source: max pixel A ccording to a recently published study of 2,000 US adults, there is one topic that is really taboo when it comes to dating, and that topic is money. The statistics show that the vast majority are unwilling to discuss this, with most claiming they would much prefer to discuss other taboo subjects, such as politics and religion, in order to avoid talking about it altogether. Helen Fisher, the chief scientific advisor behind the research, suggested that online daters just don’t want to have that all-important money talk, with the only associated topic they’re comfortable discussing being their career. Keeping quiet about our cash Source: Max Pixel The study in question focused on respondents who were either actively using a dating platform or had met their partner online at Badoo or something similar. When questioned about the subjects they felt comfortable exploring, the vast majority felt similarly about their finances i.e. that they were ‘not comfortable at all’ sharing this information with those they met. The numbers were revealing, with 69 percent claiming they would not wish to disclose information about any debts, and the same number clarifying that they would want to keep their credit score to themselves. 64 percent also said that they weren’t comfortable sharing their income, with 53 percent saying the same of their spending habits. Even more revealingly, perhaps, 18 percent believed that discussing their finances had led to previous break-ups. Fisher suggests that this is because money tends to be a very personal topic, one that “says so much about you.” Expanding on this statement, the study’s lead posited that, for all of us, it is a way of getting clues about our partner, helping us to build a better picture of what they’ll be like as a parent, friend, and significant other. A close-lipped society Source: Max Pixel Given the importance of the topic, one might argue that – discomfort aside – it is essential to talk about it, yet one in five Americans never have such a conversation with their other half. Unfortunately for them, this can have a highly detrimental impact on their monetary health. As expert Greg Heller explains: “The major benefit of speaking about money is getting the subject out in the open.” He argues that this can help to engender a sense of relief, in that people are able to not only discuss their situation, but also any fears or financial insecurities they might have. This sharing can help them to make better decisions, set obtainable goals, and work together as a team to build a stronger financial future. This is a view that Discover’s Kate Manfred agrees with, suggesting that it’s vital to talk about money early on in order to ensure your outlooks align. With it playing such a large part in serious relationships, it means that you can get onto the same page from the start and don’t have to worry about running into problems further down the line. How would you feel about discussing such a topic with your partner? Let us know in the comments below.",1
"T he highlight of April in horse racing and arguably the season in the sport, is the Grand National at Aintree. This 4m2f contest is hugely popular as once a year, punters love placing a bet on this race, regardless of whether they choose form, colours or a name to make their selection. Here is an early look at the horses that stand out from the entries for the 2018 renewal next month. Total Recall The bookmakers look to have got the betting right for the Grand National this year as Total Recall tops the betting at 10/1 to come out on top over the big fences at Aintree and it is really hard to oppose him. The Ladbrokes Trophy winner has won all three of his starts this season and he is trained by the maestro himself, Willie Mullins. This Irish raider could improve for the step up in trip and with Ruby Walsh, who will be seeking his third Grand National winner, on his back in the race, there is so much to like about him. Definitly Red One of the classiest horses to the Grand National field this year is Definitely Red as his form this season is good enough for him to take his chance at the Cheltenham Festival, where he has been backed into 10/1 in the Cheltenham Gold Cup betting. If he is unable to prevail at the Festival, don’t rule him out to gain compensation at Aintree as he should love the stamina test the race presents. Brian Ellison’s chaser has already had two fantastic wins so far in the season as he was successful in the Many Clouds Chase and Cotswold Chase. At nine years old, he is the perfect age to have a shot at the feature race at Aintree, where he is as big as 20/1. The Last Samuri The Last Samuri went close to slaying his rivals in the 2016 Grand National when he finished second in the 40 runner field behind Rule the World. Last year’s attempt was not quite as good, however, as he got around the course again. In four attempts over the Grand National fences, The Last Samuri has always finished his race; he is a very reliable operator. With a bit of luck this year, he could well be the first past the post. At 20/1 in the betting, he represents one of the best each-way bets next month. Vicente Vicente is a two-time Scottish Grand National winning after landing the race at Ayr in 2016 and 2017, which shows he has the stamina for the four-mile plus races on the calendar in the UK and Ireland. Unfortunately, Paul Nicholls’ runner did not participate for long last year as he came down at the very first fence after making a mistake. If you can forgive that error, he is very much overpriced at 33/1. The nine-year-old often produces his best form at the back end of the season so hopefully, he can come good at Aintree this time around. The 2018 Grand National takes place on April 14, but betting is already open on the race if you want to get your money down early.",1
"Extreme left wing hierarchical elements in tech companies like Google and Facebook are pandering to communist China by the massive global censorship push that is going on right now. If you run a site that does not exhibit Maoist communist or Marxist rhetoric then you will wonder why your site got deleted from YouTube or Facebook, or was demonetised by Google on Adsense. This is because the Chinese are taking over the internet right now, and the China market is too lucrative for the tech companies to ignore. It’s already too late as the back deals have been done between high ranking communist party officials and the likes of Google. Sadly, this also signals the end of free speech on the Internet, as the good old days when every opinion was allowed, will soon be a thing of the past. Free speech and its loss will go down the road of privacy, where there is none today. Millennials, for example do not know what privacy is, and the next generation will not know freedom of speech. YouTube, which is now owned by Google, used to be a nice site. Now it is a miserable soup of Orwellian Marxist censorship where extreme left wing groups like Snopes, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Defamation League have been given carte blanche to dictate what is allowed and what is not. These censors ultimately follow Chinese communistic dictatorial processes in their censorship. Suffice to say, any differing opinion to Maoist communist ideology is defined as ‘hate speech’ an all encompassing term used to censor freedom of expression, art, satire, political opinion. Therefore, globally, it now looks like China, this great communist juggernaut that has been nurtured and allowed to grow by the West like some huge puss filled pustule, has effectively conquered the Western ideals of democracy through the back door, the tech companies, which already have a monopolistic octopus grip over every facet of the Internet, are following the route of totalitarian dictatorial regimes like communist China. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been sold out, we have been betrayed, and there is nothing we can do about it now. It is too late. The tenets of Western democracy, free speech, and free expression are now officially dead. Unfortunately, it’s only going to get a lot worse from now on. ",1
"I t is not easy to become a successful gambler. It takes not only advanced knowledge in gambling but also certain personal qualities. In order to win, the gambler has to possess considerable emotional stability. He needs to stay calm when losing and never get overly emotional during the game. The chance to win in gambling depends much on what personal qualities the gambler has. Strong personality plus advanced knowledge of gambling strategies bring success to the player. In order to understand how good you are as a potential gambler, try Gratis-spinn as an example of online casino house to test your luck. Successful players often are very emotionally stable people. They have strong personalities and this is their competitive advantage. They are fearless and very determined. Successful gamblers never overestimate their chances in the game. They keep neutral attitude until the end. It is also good to keep in mind that big winnings happens rarely. Successful gambler is not the one who wins each single game. A successful player is the one who does not lose belief in himself facing failures. Statistics show you have to gamble multiple times in order to win a considerable sum of money, but it is still possible. What Is Needed To Become A Good Gambler Being a gambler is almost like having a profession. The person who gambles has to possess: Knowledge in the field. For many, gambling seems to be an issue of luck. However, lucky gamblers use multiple strategies in order to succeed; it is especially applicable for card games and table games. Right personal qualities. Each person is individualistic, but most successful players have much in common. Sharp intelligence and fine personal qualities help the player succeed in game. Players often have to spend much time to improving their knowledge and personal qualities as well. The well-known “poker face” is an example of emotional skill needed to mask one’s feelings about his cards when playing poker. Personal Qualities That Determine The Professional Player Strong personal qualities are indispensable in gambling. They include, but are not limited to: Strong determination. For a person to be self-determined, it takes real effort. However, it is worth it. Self-determined player follows the goal. If his goal is to win, he will test his luck multiple times. He knows that sooner or later he will get the winning. Being adventurous. It is the personal quality that is hard to develop. Usually there are two types of people. Ones risk without thinking before it, the others are simply too afraid to undertake risk. Successful players are not afraid to risk, but also evaluate their decisions before risking. Being self-motivated. Motivation is key to success in any business. For the successful player it is important to find his source of motivation. It is also important to know exactly what motivates you. Personal qualities often determine whether the person will be successful or not, whether it is in gambling or in any other field. However, in gambling, where much depends on pure luck, personal qualities are able to add at least a bit more to the chances of winning.",1
"Former Conservative PM, John Major The will of the majority of the British people on June 23, 2016 was to LEAVE the EU. Therefore, John Major, former Tory PM, and europhile, is wrong, wrong, wrong in trying to reverse the will of the British people who voted to leave in the EU referendum. When 17.4 million people voted in the democratically held EU referendum to leave the European Union, they meant it then, and they mean it now. John Major was a thoroughly unexceptional prime minister, and as he has got it wrong today, he continually got it wrong in the past too. Black Wednesday 16 September 1992 In 1992, John Major made a serious judgemental mistake that cost Britain dearly. He tried to keep the UK in the ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism) causing massive market upheaval and leading to Britain leaving anyway. His poor judgement was also seen in his disastrous role in the (CAR) Common Agricultural Policy in 1992. John Major, you are wrong, wrong, wrong. However much Soros and his cronies are paying you through the Open Society foundation, please give the envelopes of money back. You are already well looked after with a decent pension you greedy grey salmonella egg rogering whiffle whaffle. Please go away Mr Major. You are a listless limp loser who has had his day.

"hoc est bellum For the last three decades, all ads on television have portrayed men as bungling idiots, emasculated morons and below the superiority of women, but finally ad agency GSD&M have created an endearing short film ad for men’s product ‘Harry’s’ which hopefully will induce other ad agencies to change too. Without any overt macho imagery or inclination, creative director, Luke Crissell accomplishes the delicate subject of what it is to be a man. #metoo people may scoff and scowl at the ad, and may even try to ban it as it shows a tender view of masculinity, but this may be a sign that the anti-male hatred that we have had to endure for years is slowly ebbing away. In a world where regular men are derided, hated upon and punished, there is no wonder that male suicide is at record levels, where at every turn in the media and social networks men are continually attacked and denigrated. With fertility dropping at drastic rates in the industrialised world, resulting in low birthrates, many Western nations have effectively shot themselves in the foot by their overt push to emasculate and denigrate men. Sadly the ad agencies catered to this anti-male hysteria and hatred by peddling adverts that portrayed this view. The ad agencies were simply catering to female spending power, however during this period they forgot that regular men buy things too.",1
"Flea Aww, poor diddums, Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers is telling everyone to get off of the drugs. Here’s a guy who has done more drugs in his lifetime than whole swathes of Los Angeles, and he is a nice boy now? He is supposedly scared of becoming addicted. Like what happened to the Red Hot Chilli Peppers anyway? They used to make cool music when they were on cocaine, speed and heroin, before they sold their souls and became ‘good clean cut boys’ who drink soy and eat cabbage. Albums like The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Mother’s Milk reeked of drug usage, testosterone and creative destruction. This shit could have your jumpin’ jimminies jumping like jumping beans on acid laced with pcp. You know, the days before Hillel jumped the ghost. We got no time for hypocrisy. The RHCP made their name from drug usage. If it wasn’t for the drugs they would not have gone the extra mile musically in the old days. So, this is why to hear Flea, that mean bass bumper, talking like an old man saying stuff like ‘don’t take opioids’ just doesn’t take. Okay, Flea is old now, but still this fucker should know better. Flea, if you and the boys were real rock stars, you wouldn’t be around no more. Instead, you bowed down, sold out, and are now banal mediocre old farts with dyed hair playing boring banal mediocre pop ‘music’ to people with dead ears.",1
"Agent Cob - License to Spill (secrets) Former Soviet spy during the Cold War and active agent to the EU, Agent Cob, has a new mission, to stop Brexit. “Comrades, I have been given new orders from our masters in the EU Commission, and that is to somehow get into power, and then have a Brexit, where there is no actual Brexit. We will do this by staying in the customs union and single market therefore nothing will change before or after ‘Brexit’. This cunning plan will be administered by me and other agents who are implanted in the Tory government. Hardworking agents like Anna Soubry (Agent 45) and Nicky Morgan (agent 36), Dominic Grieve (agent 22) and other traitors to Britain.” Speaking from his dacha, agent Cob left coded messages to those who wish to betray Britain and condemn it to continual rule from Brussels forever. Under the current permissive climate, treason is perfectly allowed in the UK, and the security forces are turning a blind eye to those who betray Britain’s interests for money and other benefits. Thanks to Tony Blair (agent 666), who repealed the 1795 Treason Act in 1998, treachery against Britain is now rife. Many agents working against Britain rely on special payments from Brussels delivered in brown envelopes at secret locations, and continue their anti-Brexit plots with impunity due to the lax treason laws in Britain today.",1
"cartoon: Damien Glez http://glez.org/ Infowars, is under attack from YouTube and America’s liberal media. Here is a site built up primarily by Alex Jones, a man passionate in libertarian rights, who is circumnavigating the blatant censorship by media forces by selling his own brand of health products, just so that he can continue running the show. Jones has every right to do and say what he is saying. Down in the trenches, the Daily Squib has also been affected by the Google push to clamp down on free speech, and censor the Internet of any thought that does not follow socialist viewpoints. We were booted from Google news feed, our site practically erased from search and our YouTube channel demonetised and ghost banned. There were also numerous threats to halt our revenue unless we took down certain articles. We know first hand that free speech is now under attack from Internet giants who are effectively bullying little minnows like the DS. That tells us that we may be small but what we say has power, because you have gone to great lengths to shut us down at every opportunity. We have fought for ten years tooth and nail for freedom of speech and our right to write our brand of satire. Alex Jones and his Infowars team have the right to say what they want. So, we may not always agree but you have the right to free speech and we would defend that right with our lives. What does Google want, an Internet where every opinion is the same? Where the only views you see are written by ‘yes men’ on the socialist payroll? That dystopian vision is something Orwell would have understood in the Ministry of Truth where doublespeak is king and censorship, the norm. The socialists always claim they are inclusive, progressive and fair. Not from the massive censorship we have seen, you are not. Any opinion other than yours is immediately blacklisted and either deleted or relegated to Internet no man’s land. I urge Infowars and all the others to fight, and we will fight beside you in the name of free speech. We will fight with all our might to the last man standing. Fight and never give up our rights.

"In accordance with new laws governing the safety of children in schools, the Federal School Board has agreed with President Donald Trump’s suggestion that teachers should be armed in class. Dionne Fenwick, a school board member at Grassy Knoll High School in Winstow, Alabama, was one of the key proponents to the new legislation which will train teachers in the use of firearms. “First things first. What would you prefer — an unarmed teacher unable to protect her class from a shooter, or a highly trained gun toting teacher that can shoot an invading shooter and save her class?” After the recent tragic shootings in Florida where 17 children lost their lives after a crazed ex-pupil doped up on antidepressants and Antifa brainwashing shot up the school, there was no way of defending the kids. If there had been someone in the school with firearms knowledge, those 17 kids would be alive today. President Trump has vowed that new legislation will allow teachers to have heavy duty machine guns and pistols in class, just in case there is a shooter scenario. “The teachers will be trained in firearms, in safety and taught how to deal with shooters in an emergency situation. The classrooms will have secure areas where the firearms will be kept,” Bill Emerson, headteacher at Johnson Mitre High School, Michigan, told a recent CNN report.",1
"Brainless socialite and social networking celebrity, Kylie Jenner stated today that she has gone off orange juice. The Chicago Board of Trade saw orange juice futures (ICE) plunge over 60% wiping off billions in seconds. “Folks were buying and buying, like something out of Trading Places, then some schmuck puts up a post Kylie Jenner just updated on her Instagram. The calls for sell were so loud that my ears started to bleed. When the bell went off there were people lying in the pits with nosebleeds, suits ripped and paper everywhere,” one exhausted trader, who sadly lost $850,000 today revealed. Oil Futures Last week, oil futures jumped 45% on Thursday when Kyle Jenner tweeted that she was so glad she filled her gold laminated Range Rover SUV with petrol, and that oil was a really amazing thing that made cars move. Market analysts for leading Wall Street firm, Shaboing and Shaboing, are baffled and confused and don’t know what each day holds. “We know that this dumb broad has a brain the size of a pea, but she has clever people controlling her marketing. We also know that they’re making money from the girl, and tell her what to say. So in the morning, they buy up shitloads of x stock whilst it’s sitting at the bottom. Midday they make a post on Instagram and tell Kylie Jenner to say she likes x product a lot. Literally in seconds the stock price shoots up some, and they make a killing. Goes for shorting too.

"Agent Cob It is revealed how Jeremy Corbyn’s Soviet spymasters had instructed him to throw a copy of Karl Marx’s book Das Kapital over a garden fence in Hyde Park, London, if he wanted to contact them. It was also revealed how he was told to carry a squash ball when meeting his handler, who would wear a pair of gloves and carry a red carnation as a “recognition signal”. On another occasion he was instructed to meet his Soviet contacts at a certain table in the Stags Head pub in Islington, north London, and would signal his Soviet handlers by clicking his heels seven and a half times, then spinning around four times whilst whistling the East German anthem a semitone above its normal register. When in parliament, if MP Jeremy Corbyn picked his nose twice, this would reveal a signal to spies that Margaret Thatcher would not be attending that day, however if he picked his nose then ate the bogie, this signal meant she would be attending. However, if he picked his nose, then smeared the bogie on another MP’s jacket, this would mean the PM would be delayed by a few minutes. If in danger, Corbyn would signal to his Soviet masters by clucking like a chicken then conducting a series of semi-circle maneuvers whilst simultaneously dragging his left foot behind him and jumping slightly to the left. Highly Trained Soviet Operative According to former Soviet spymasters, Jeremy Corbyn was also trained in the usage of many spy tools including special gadgets like listening devices, carrier pigeons and abseiling techniques. Trained in the dark espionage arts, Corbyn would casually pass on British state secrets to his handlers via carrier pigeon. The specially trained pigeons would be acquired at Trafalgar Square after midnight from on top of the fourth lion statue to the right, then flown to clandestine addresses across London. House of Commons The files, released for the first time, disclosed how Corbyn revealed details of Margaret Thatcher’s movements and if she was wearing underwear or not on the day of attendance at the House of Commons. This information was crucial to the Soviets for some reason, and Agent Cob never questioned why. If Maggie was wearing underwear on the day of attendance, this would be signalled by Jeremy Corbyn with a series of grunts, and he would hold his breath for a few minutes until his face went red. If Corbyn saw that Mrs Thatcher had not worn any underwear, by utilising his Soviet mirror gadget, he would hoot like an owl, then scratch his crotch four times whilst moving backwards. One of Corbyn’s contacts, Agent 9, would hold a red book in his hands whenever they met. This signal meant that it was okay to talk freely, however if he held a black book, this would mean that they had to go elsewhere to converse. Corbyn was also trained in stealth techniques, as well as military grade combat. His shoes were specially fitted with spikes laced with deadly poison, and would be deployed by clicking the heels three times. As a last resort, Agent Cob was also given a cyanide pill just in case he was ever found out by the British secret services and interrogated.",1
"Former Cold War Soviet spy, Comrade Corbyn is angry with the media after being outed as an informant to Soviet Russia recently. Speaking at his dacha in Islington, the supreme leader of the Labour party said that “changes would be coming” to press freedom. Analyst, Borgmer Lynns, revealed the truth of Corbyn’s deadly message. “What Corbyn is effectively saying is he will squash press freedom and make Britain look like Soviet Russia, or Stasi East Germany during the Cold War. Seeing as he was a spy for the Soviets, as recalled by Czech spy, Jan Sarkocy, who recruited Corbyn in the 1980s, he has a real affinity for the machinations of the Cold War era. He wants to introduce it into Britain with mass censorship and threats.” Pravda The Corbyn press model would be to nationalise all newspapers, where all editorial decisions would have to go through a central Soviet committee linked to the Labour party. This is already occurring with the BBC, who after a week of media reports of Corbyn’s spy past had been revealed, had still barely acknowledged the news, and refused to report on it so as to protect their leader and party chief. The BBC is the official voice of the Labour party and supports its soviet ideals with extreme passion. The offices of the Pravda newspaper were transferred to Moscow on March 3, 1918 when the Soviet capital was moved there. Pravda became an official publication, or “organ”, of the Soviet Communist Party. Pravda became the conduit for announcing official policy and policy changes and would remain so until 1991. Subscription to Pravda was mandatory for state run companies, the armed services and other organizations until 1989. Other newspapers like the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, the Sun, the Times, and Express, would be ordered to tow the Labour soviet line or force being shut down. If Labour comes into power under Comrade Corbyn, many would flee the former nation of Britain and take their business to places where democracy still resides.",1
"With news that Peter Thiel, like other billionaires are setting up safe havens away from everything in case of economic and financial collapse in the West are sadly mistaken. When the collapse comes, there will be complete disorder and chaos. Banks will shut, all social security will stop, and all emergency services will eventually be forced to stop after being inundated. Naturally, disorder and collapse of all financial services will result in rioting in the streets accompanied with mass looting of all businesses and rich people in their homes. No food and water for three days will make any population, however civilised beforehand, into wild savages. One must remember that disorder in the West, is a trigger for the West’s enemies to strike. Therefore, China, Iran, N.Korea and Russia would capitalise on the chaos. Striking while your enemy is at his weakest is a sure way for success in any military attack. The precept for invasion could also be cloaked in aiding the West, where they move troops in to keep order on the premise of helping whichever nation they are invading. South China Sea and All That This is why New Zealand, and Australia, which are only a ship ride away from China would be one of the first places to be attacked. China has had its eye on Australia for some time, and who is to say they won’t have an eye on New Zealand as well? Peter Thiel, and his billionaire friends would thus be rounded up just like everyone else and sent to re-education camps or communist Chinese gulags. Remember that the Chinese are desperate for land, and Australia/New Zealand have plenty for its needs. When it comes to swarm warfare, China wins hands down, nothing will get in their way, and the millions of fighting men and women of the Chinese military are a formidable force. The billionaires who are buying plots of land in New Zealand now can only be labelled as misinformed idiots with too much money and no sense. Are you that fucking stupid, blinded by your riches that you do cannot see the immediate threat lying directly above Australia? Idiots. ",1
"Agent Cob - License to Spill (secrets) The Broccoli family insisted that ex-soviet spy MP, Jeremy Corbyn should be cast as the arch villain in the new James Bond film. “We were going to do the film about Spectre, but after seeing the news about Jezza being a soviet spy in the eighties, right under everyone’s noses, we were intrigued. He is still an MP and leader of the Labour party and is sincerely hoping to seize revolutionary Bolshevik power soon. Old Jezza could take over the world and change it into some sort of communist collectivist allotment where everyone grows prize courgettes and marrows year in year out,” Cubby Broccoli’s niece, Jennifer Lettuce, told the Times. The plot change for the film has been quite time consuming for the writers but when opportunities like this arise, one has to seize the bull by the horns, or in Jeremy Corbyn’s words, the Czech spy by the cheque book. Jeremy Corbyn was allegedly paid a measly sum of £10,000 for the information he handed over to the soviets in the 1980s, but in the film, he will be demanding over a million quid. This money is then funnelled into a cultist secretive group called Momentum. “The secret to a good Bond film is always the villain. This is why Jeremy Corbyn will be ideal, because he has actually lived the life of a spy. Daniel Craig, who is meant to be James Bond hasn’t ever met a real spy before, and he is really chuffed about working with Jeremy,” the film’s director, Johnson Marx, told media outlets on Monday.",1

"Soweto, South Africa today The new Black Panther film is atrocious, and no one with any standards should go and see it, unless you catch it on an internet streaming site for free. People should not fund such a ridiculous racially divisive film which glorifies black supremacy and racism entertwined in impossible fantasy. In the isolationist fictional world of Wakanda; no immigration is allowed, the city has large walls around it, is a homogeneous ethno-state where only black people are allowed, and promotes black supremacy over all other races. Just reverse the colour and you get Trump’s vision of America. Amongst this utopian fantasy world lives black superheros with insane technology that can only be dreamed of, and is not close to reality in any way. Who designed this technological cornucopia of immense intricacy and superior advancement? The Wakanda crew can barely string a sentence together let alone create anti-gravity tech or nano suits which defy the laws of physics. The reality of Africa is that it is a continent of great resources but poor function. There is huge poverty in the continent and a film like this is a disgrace to Africans. It is essentially saying, if we were clever enough we could have the technology of the West within this fantasy but we don’t, the reality thus bites even more, and insults the African states of today who have very little technological advancement or technical knowhow. Apart from the brilliant Blade series, the only real black superhero seen on screen has to be ‘Ghost Dog’ with Forest Whitaker, who was not essentially a Marvel superhero but one of superhuman strength and intellect, thanks to diligent study of the Hagakure. Okay, Forest took the pay cheque for Black Panther, but we should not begrudge him on that. The director of Black Panther, Ryan Coogler, is obviously a black supremacist as can be seen in all his previous efforts, and his vision is one of complete domination of all by the black race. This is therefore not about equality, but supremacy, and where all other races are subjugated by the ‘superior’ black race. In essence, if this film were made of a race other than black, it would be panned as deeply racist, however because there is a special card for African Americans, it is instead lauded, and promoted as the next big thing since sliced bread. Double standards for African Americans, mixed in with hypocrisy and affirmative action. Don’t go and see this fantasy film that disregards everything about African reality, instead please give to the many aid charities in Africa who really need the help.

"Why are people surprised that Jeremy Corbyn gave away British secrets and crucial information to the Soviets in the 1980s? Certainly, here is a man who is a staunch Marxist who wants to come into power and create a Soviet dictatorship in the UK. “Mr Sarkocy, who was expelled from the UK by Margaret Thatcher and now lives in Bratislava, said that the information revealed by the MP – whose codename was Agent Cob – was “rated in Moscow as the number one”. Source: DT One can only imagine the amount of state secrets Comrade Corbyn handed over to the Soviets during the eighties, however one thing is sure, the people who are supporting Corbyn are supporting someone who is a danger to national interests and has allegedly caused great harm to the UK in the past by collaborating with its enemies. Should something be done about this? Well, of course, but it seems the sanitised MI6 are just sitting on their fingers, and everyone else is brushing it under the carpet. In the last elections, when Corbyn nearly came to power, Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, warned that “Mr Corbyn could not be trusted as prime minister and that, rather than be allowed to run the security services, he would previously have been investigated by them.” Is anyone going to act on the new information that has come to light? Surely, someone or some agency, or some entity must investigate further, and bring Corbyn to justice. Naturally, this news has not been reported by the BBC. You can’t have a former Soviet spy running the country, especially someone who sought to harm Britain by giving away information that put us in danger. Anyone out there? Anyone?",1
"I f you’re relatively new to the phenomenon that is bitcoin, you may just be curious as to how you can spend the virtual currency. The answers may surprise you. Here are a few of the craziest products and services you never would have believed you can buy with bitcoin. A college degree Colleges are beginning to realise the benefits of bitcoin and have thus begun to accept the currency as a valid payment method for tuition fees and more. The first university to accept bitcoin was Cyprus’ University of Nicosia. A number of other universities followed suit, including the University of Cumbria in the UK. A trip to Space Sir Richard Branson has a plan. The billionaire tycoon wants to start flying rich people into space on his Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo. Branson is a big fan of the virtual currency and believes that it only makes sense for what he referred to as “the pioneer of a global currency” to be used for the travel of the future. Celebrities who have secured a place on Branson’s trip include Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber, and Lady Gaga. If you wanted to join them, it would set you back a princely 291.41 BTC. The world’s first Mac If you’re a fan of technology, you could own a piece of history in the form of the world’s first Apple Macintosh. It was released in 1984, and if you have around 6.34 BTC (at the time of writing) to spare, you can get your hands on this golden piece of tech nostalgia. Roulette games You can also spin the roulette wheel online by depositing a few bitcoins. It makes sense, as roulette remains one of the more popular casino games to play. When playing with the virtual currency, your gambling will remain anonymous. Further, there are reputable sites such as Gamble.io which recommends where to play, as well as advising on the best bitcoin roulette bonus from each casino. A goat or two Bitcoin isn’t simply about buying internet products or futuristic things. It’s now being accepted by regular real-world companies, as well. Cafes, restaurants, pubs, and even goat salespeople have begun allowing customers to pay by virtual currency. Bitcoin Goat has become something of an internet sensation – and isn’t doing the promotion of bitcoin any harm, either. A private island Bitcoin enthusiast and software developer Ryan Weaver intends to sell his private island, located off Pohnpei, to anyone who has the right amount of bitcoins. Weaver believes that he may be able to negotiate a deal once the price for bitcoin surges again. He hopes to sell the island for approximately 968 bitcoins. That’s not a bad deal when you consider that just seven short years ago, that would have bought you a measly couple of pizzas. Along with the above strange and curious ways to spend your bitcoin, you could also use the digital currency to buy a Canadian gold mine, spy coins, or mammoth tusks. Once you’ve turned your cash into bitcoin, you’re opening yourself up to a whole new world of weird.",1
"Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkinson has revealed after extensive research into the Fake News purge on many sites across the internet, that Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt was the mastermind behind it all. His modus operandi was to smear any news site that held alternative views to the democrats, and Hillary Clinton during and after the 2016 election. Our site has suffered a lot from Google’s bias because satire was wrongly labelled as ‘fake news’, and we were numerously threatened by Google, to remove satirical material or face the consequences. We have also been demonetized and shadow banned on YouTube. Our site was also ejected from Google news feed during the fake news fiasco. “Digging deeper, she discovered that Google was one of the big donors behind First Draft’s “fake news” messaging. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was run by Eric Schmidt, who happened to be a huge Hillary Clinton supporter. Schmidt “offered himself up as a campaign adviser and became a top multi-million donor to it. His company funded First Draft around the start of the election cycle,” Attkisson said. “Not surprisingly, Hillary was soon to jump aboard the anti-fake news train and her surrogate David Brock of Media Matters privately told donors he was the one who convinced Facebook to join the effort.” Attkisson declared that “the whole thing smacked of the roll-out of a propaganda campaign.” The Daily Squib surmised itself that the Fake News scheme was a way for the democrats to purge any form of alternative or conservative thought through censorship and labelling it as fake news. We never thought however that Google would be behind all of this, and are frankly disgusted, but not surprised. This whole sorry fake news debacle just shows the inherent power Google has over the internet and how it uses its power for the purposes of bias, corruption and censorship of large swathes of internet websites for its own ends. One thing about free speech is that every viewpoint should be heard, however much one disagrees with any viewpoint, it has a right to be heard. Censorship and bias thwarts the true tenets of democracy. By trying to artificially skew thought and literature, one dwells into the world of totalitarianism and dictatorship, essentially what Google has become. The only good thing about Google at the moment is Ray Kurzweil, who we are great fans of, and hope he is using his job to really move things forward in a positive way. Schmidt is now the head of an advisory board at the Pentagon, and is now teaching them the dark arts of manipulation, disinformation and propaganda for the internet age.",1

The killing spree started when Cruz set off the fire alarm so he could shoot more people funnelling through the corridors. As Cruz was a member of ANTIFA, and clearly supported their extreme left-wing communist ideology there are several motives for his actions. Firstly, ANTIFA is about disarming Americans, they are anti-gun, therefore what better way to bring up the anti-gun message again with another school massacre, secondly, he could have been targeting conservative students, especially Trump supporters, thirdly, he was angry at being expelled. We advocate for an ideology that has killed 94,000,000+ people in the 20th century and the media doesn’t bat an eye. Why? #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/8XJAjOGBEx — Official Antifa (@OfficialAntifa) August 13, 2017 Of course, Cruz, like many of his communist brethren is brainwashed into the cause of revolution, this can only be done by violence. This is not just another American shooting spree, we are used to them now, but this was a politically motivated shooting. More to come. Before sending your “thoughts and prayers” to #Parkland keep in mind that 31% of the people living in Broward Country voted for a literal fascist dictator. pic.twitter.com/cz3RSzyN2H — Official Antifa (@OfficialAntifa) February 14, 2018 UPDATE What kind of white supremacist shoots a bunch of white people? Some MSM news services are now claiming that Cruz is in fact a far right wing Trump supporter who joined a supremacist paramilitary group that they conveniently do not name. This news is however hard to believe, especially when the Hispanic Cruz was registered to vote as a democrat. Hispanic democrat voters are not allowed in white supremacist groups. Naturally, there will be smoke and mirrors put out by certain agencies and factions, so it is hard to believe what is truth or not. One has to look at the facts, and if people suddenly appear out of nowhere claiming something, there must be questions asked, especially if the articles show very little evidence of what they are claiming, with no actual sources or names. FURTHER UPDATE MSM reports that Cruz was affiliated with white supremacist groups has been refuted by the Anti-Defamation League who backed away from their previous claims. Detectives are investigating a possible connect between Cruz and a small, Florida-based white supremacist group called the Republic of Florida, which seeks to create a “white ethnostate” in Florida. But the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that monitors hate groups, has backed away from its initial report that Cruz had been involved with that group. The league put out a statement saying that a representative of the group, who had earlier claimed Cruz was involved, now says he had been “misunderstood.” via Sun Sentinel",1
"Liberals and politically correct censors who censor linguistic language inadvertently make those censored words more powerful, more delicious, and liberating to use. Every day, we hear of another word in the English language that has been banned by the people who think they control speech, however what they are doing is strengthening the very word they seek to ban. When you’re at home or in the car, you can say those words with a devilish glee, however you cannot say them in public without being called out by the pc-police and their mission to shut down language. These banned words increase in power everytime they are censored. “Yes, but these words may offend someone?” they cry, yet their censorship offends people who value free speech. We are continually told that we have to like ‘selected’ people. You have to like them. You are forced to like them because it is the politically correct thing to do, but can you force people to like people they want nothing to do with, and NEVER will? Can you force someone to like things they just have nothing in common with? According to the globalist, this is called tolerance, however stick one of these high hat globalists in a room full of these people and you will soon see intolerance. The elite globalist may dictate you live among these people, yet they live themselves in secluded luxury away from the detritus. Even the most tolerant people can get fucking pissed off. It should be ones given right to detest others as they wish, and even to display this if they want, however in polite society this is a no, no. Try and fucking force me to like you, but I will fight you to the end to have the right to detest and disagree with certain segments of humanity if I want to and vice versa.",1
"Fantasy versus Reality Doctors and physicians have come together to label the painter who painted the Michelle Obama portrait as someone with severe visual impairment problems that technically make her blind. “We don’t know how she can function in daily life, let alone be procured to paint the official portrait of the former first lady, Michael Obama?” Hernandez Consellio M.D, is the Director of the UCLA Laser Refractive Center and Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology at the Cataract and Refractive Surgery Division at the world renowned Weinstein Eye Institute. Many experts in the mechanics of eyesight and Ophthalmology have asked the painter to come in and get urgent help as she is in danger of not only hurting herself but others too. “I mean does this woman drive a car or operate heavy machinery? She is a danger to herself and others and must seek urgent medical assistance,” eye surgeon, Balthazar Medley M.D. appealed on Monday. According to the Obamas, the painter of the Michelle Obama portrait only got the role because of ‘affirmative action’. In the United States, even though some black people may not be qualified or able to do a job, they are still given the role not for their ability but for the colour of their skin. For many, this is seen as ‘positive discrimination’ and is not a justified way to run employment, however it is a valid American system and has been running for many years. The painter of the Michelle Obama portrait, Ambingo Shaquanda Fantasay, was adamant that the portrait she painted is what she saw: “I axe her, I said is that you Michelle, she say yeah? I thanked her fo’ da job. So I painted whut was in ma mind of whut I thought I saw.” Blind artists in the art world are not rare. Last year, deaf, dumb and blind artist, Damien Hirst sold one of his paintings for £4.8 million.",1
"Working for a charity has never been so lucrative, what with astronomical salaries given to parasites who ponce around behind their desks pretending to help suffering people in need. Oxfam have been caught indulging in orgies in sunny Carribean climes, according to the news, and to capitulate on this, the charity have decided to capitalise on the frenzied mass media coverage and free publicity. Oxfam Orgies to Fund Another Salary Increase Oxfam marketing manager, Celia Ortens, salary £465,000/annum, who works for the company only three days a week, reveals the plan: “Orgies are good for headlines. We need to up our salaries, so we will be holding Fundraising Orgies in the Bahamas every two weeks ongoing. To attend the orgy, each participant has to pay $60,000.” According to the Oxfam accountant, Bernie Fenster, all it will take is a participation of “200 orgy fuckers every two weeks so that Oxfam HQ staff can have another pay rise”. With most charities only giving away 1% of their take to charity work, and the rest to massive lucrative salaries, plane flights, unlimited expense accounts, parties, taxis and alcohol, most sane people do not give money to charities, however, the world is not filled with sane people it seems and charities bring in millions every day. The Romans Speaking from one of her mansions, Ms Ortens revealed that the orgies will include anything that has ever been thought of or conceived in history. “The Romans liked their orgies, and we will certainly include as much from that era as today’s Tinderized Bachinalian sex riddled internet generation. As for things like AIDS and other STIs, well, like Tinder, we do not discriminate. If you want to go for it, why be a downer? Our orgies have a condition where everything is allowed — as long as you pay the price at the door, because you will certainly be paying the price when you walk out the door.” The Oxfam Orgies will start in Nassau, Bahamas in April, then much like a hurricane move through the Caribbean islands. Charity worker, David Miliband, whose salary is £530,000 per annum was consulted on the Oxfam Orgies, and agreed it is a great idea, and he might even attend a few.",1

"I f you got to grips with writing your university paper and after an hour of work got stuck on the first paragraph, don’t worry, you are not the only who experiences difficulties with written assignments. Who said that expressing your thoughts on paper is easy? Even people who make a living by writing articles and journalists who write columns for the Wall Street Journal often admit that it is demanding. There are quite a few reasons why. It might be hard to write on a given topic. First of all, not every theme is to your liking. Sometimes you are assigned to write about something which is boring to death. Secondly, you have to be more or less competent about what you write. A prior research always helps to write a powerful and effective assignment. But if you are sitting in a class and have to write on demand, you might find yourself at a complete loss. All you can think of is grinding words and making sentences to make that x-hundred of words. Same about a doctoral thesis in which you have stated your main arguments, have written 50 pages and discovered that there are another 60 to go while you are running short on ideas. Luckily, you can resort to coursework writing service that will help you out. Another extreme is to write a concise article or a column limited to 500 or 700 words on a topic that you would like to cover in depth. You have so many excellent ideas and arguments, one more brilliant than another. You see the problem from different angles and would like to dwell on various aspects but you only have those 700 words. In the end you end up presenting general terms and feel dissatisfied with your writing. Sometimes you are simply not confident about your skills. This is particularly true for someone who studies abroad and uses a foreign language at a university. The questions that pop in your head are, “Does my writing sound authentic? Am I using trite phrases? Does it make sense? Does it read well?” In the end you are struggling to compose a sentence not because of insufficient language skills or poor vocabulary but because you feel insecure and are afraid of a bad reaction to your piece of writing. You should not worry. No one was born as a writer. Everybody can learn, and everyone can improve their writing skills. It just takes practice. Do not be intimidated to write in your own manner. Be yourself. Try not to sound like someone else. Read more. When you read a good piece of writing, you start noticing how nicely words can be woven together. Check out some books that provide insights on how to write effectively. Make writing part of your daily routine. Do not stop even if at times you feel discouraged. Have someone read your essays. Be ready to accept some criticism and pieces of advice. With time you will see how your writing improves. In case you have a good head for figures or sciences and you hate writing as such, but you still have to submit that essay for your Arts class, you do not have to struggle. Hire a professional team of writers who will complete your assignment and write a high-quality writing, whether it is an essay or a course paper, free of errors and plagiarism. You can set the deadline and get your paper in as little as three hours. Play to your strengths, do what you are great at and feel good about yourself.",1
"What the Daily Telegraph is claiming to have uncovered today about Soros funding Gina Miller to thwart Brexit the Daily Squib knew about in 2017 with our satirical interview alluding to her evil practices. Certainly, there is no secret to George Soros funding the most hated woman in Britain to stop Brexit. Can George Soros thwart Brexit? All the Remoaner MPs and other cohorts of money obsessed traitors are given the impetus to act against Brexit, especially when they are handed brown envelopes or suitcases full of money. The treachery of those in government who accept these payments to Remoan and thwart our democratic right to Brexit is something that is not only despicable but inherently immoral, and some would say illegal. In these times of treason, even if these money-grabbing cowards get caught in the media spotlight, as has happened with the established Daily Telegraph reporting, they will still get away with murder. The reason being, the underlying establishment who are Remainers are supporting them. How much wrong has to be committed on the people who voted for Brexit on June 23, 2016 until justice, and a bona fide exit from the EU is conducted? Leavers have been punished, denigrated and side-stepped for too long. Now is the time to fight back for democracy and to punish the crooks, scumbags and shit heads who are actively trying destroy our democratic right to leave the EU whilst getting paid huge sums of money by their masters. Fuck you Soros and fuck you Gina Miller, and all the other crooked Remoaners on the take. You are vile, corrupt criminals.",1
"http://www.epica-awards.com/ The Editors & Publishers International Creative Awards A busy Epica Awards London Showcase took place on the rooftop of production company GCRS in Great Marlborough Street on January 31. The event was designed to give London audiences a chance to enjoy the work awarded at Epica’s ceremony in Berlin in November. At the well-attended event, creatives Giles Hepworth and Bill Hartley of J. Walter Thompson London were congratulated for their award-winning entry “Ashes to Art”, which led to the agency becoming Epica’s UK agency of the year. Campaign Campaign’s global editor-in-chief, Claire Beale, who joined the Epica jury for the first time last year, praised the work. But she also encouraged more British agencies to enter Epica in the future. “I saw so much inspiring work from other countries; I felt sort of humbled really. It was a fantastic opportunity to appreciate the breadth of work from around the world. But I also thought: ‘Come on the Brits, where are you on this?’” J. Walter Thompson’s campaign involved encouraging artists to turn ashes from a catastrophic fire at the Glasgow School of Art into original artwork. This was then auctioned off to help pay for the school’s restoration. Bill Hartley remarked that the hardest part of the campaign was convincing the artists themselves to take part. “In the end we resorted to good old-fashioned direct mail, sending them charred pieces of wood in the post.” Creative Review Regular Epica juror Eliza Williams, associate editor of Creative Review, remarked that the awards show had seen an increase in brand-purposed or charity work recently. She added: “The best thing for me is not only seeing the work, but getting the journalists’ impression of it…You get a perspective that perhaps you don’t get in any other setting.” Daily Squib First time attendee at the Epica soiree, Daily Squib editor, and champion of creativity, Aur Esenbel, was truly impressed by the show of advertising and media talent: “Meeting with Mark Tungate and other denizens of the advertising, publishing world was inspiring. “It has been a great honour to have been accepted as a juror for the creative Epica awards, and one has to say that the essence of all creative work lies in intricate controlled chaotic exploration. “Defining that singular moment in the creative process when out of the ether, the creative plucks out an idea, an essence, a cherished spark that is then catapulted further with experimentation and work, to eventually create the final polished output, is not easily described. “Everyday, the Daily Squib works its creative juices whether in literature or illustration, and we are dedicated to the field of Creative Science in constructing our satire and news stories. “In line with Claire Beale, from Campaign magazine, the Epica Awards definitely needs more British input. Hopefully in 2018, the awards will see a bigger Brit emphasis. “Once again, thank you to the Epica team, and sponsors for holding such an event, and for inviting the Daily Squib to participate, it has been a true honour.” Epica Awards Director – Mark Tungate Epica editorial director Mark Tungate extended a warm thanks to GCRS for hosting the evening for the second year running. He also thanked the other sponsors: Adobe, Euronews, Screen Vision and Global Production Network. Film CataCover, which provides weather insurance for shoots, sponsored the drinks. Tungate added: “The event was as good-humoured as last year’s. Networking and socialising around a reel of outstanding creative work is a great way of shrugging off the gloom of January.”",1
"Anna Soubry protects the EU like the devil’s maiden, Mrs. Baylock protecting the Antichrist Damien in the Omen series of films. Such is her crazed EU obsessive look and her mad spiky hair that to see her walk down the halls of Westminster, many get out of her way so as not to catch that stare in her demonic EU maddened eyes. She lives for the EU, and she will certainly die for it too, her glazed over eyes pointing backwards, and the spittle foaming at her mouth. The devil’s maiden, Anna Soubry, has planted herself somehow into the Conservative party, and within it she wreaks havoc, constantly preaching about how great her satanic masters are in Brussels, and how leaving the curtain of evil in the EU will destroy Britain. Whenever there’s a parliamentary debate, Anna Soubry suddenly appears out of a hidden door, with a puff of smoke, this demonic feral creature and her furry raspy tongue spits out vitriol against anyone who values Britain’s freedom from the EU. She is against freedom, she is only for the EU and its heaving laws of certain imprisonment. So who is Anna Soubry? Borne from the puckered popping anus of a jackal in a cemetery somewhere in Lincolnshire, this priestess of the infernal was schooled in the dark arts from an early age, and was once a journalist and TV presenter for Grampian Television North. She somehow appeared in the Conservative party as a plant from her masters in Brussels and has to this day continued to undermine not only the Tories but the Brexit process at every turn. This evil, festering boil from the leaking asshole of Hades follows the cult of the EU with such fervour and brainwashed dedication that she has had the EU flags tattooed on her buttocks, as well as a hammer and sickle tattoo on her sagging swaying hag breasts. Nevertheless, no one knows how she got to Westminster? The only thing they know, as MPs and their staff mill around the hallways and offices, is that if she is heard coming, hide, jump, run, get away with you, do not look into her devil eyes, or you too could succumb to her satanic demonic ways as well and forever be damned to Hell.",1
"B urstcoin is the future of cryptocurrency because it is ecologically green to mine, and is safe to use. Mining Bitcoin and other graphic card utilising cryptos is killing the planet. The amount of resources used to mine these heavily electricity reliant currencies is causing an ecological disaster. Look at the Bitcoin farms in China/ Russia/ Iceland/ America where vast amounts of electricity are used to mine these coins; where the amount of heat generated by these number crunching GPU/ASIC graphics modules have to be cooled down.

"When the whole shithouse goes up in flames The usually comatose fear index (VIX) has jumped 115.60% and is rising by the hour. Stockbrokers are running around their offices scurrying like rats from a sinking ship! Investors are getting the fear..like serious fear. If Bitcoin can drop like a rock, why not legitimate stocks? Maybe this is revenge by the hackers and dark netters after their Bitcoin high was spiked by various governments. It only makes sense, if governments want to hurt Crypto, the hackers and users on the dark net will fight back. Shit flies when the shit storm hits, and fear rises faster than it takes a margin call to liquidate your positions. Sure, this could be a correction, hang in there, maybe even buy more, but what if it ain’t, you’ll be locked in as the stocks hit the floor, your once tidy profit now a worthless piece of shit. Can you seriously watch the whole market drop while holding? No, siree! Better to dump, keep what cash you have. There’s also the Democrats, obviously they are enjoying this every moment with avid appreciation at the destruction of the Teflon Don, but what if the Dems engineered this fall? Well, they’ll hurt their people as much as others, although the hierarchy will only see that as collateral damage, and a necessary evil. Who frickin’ knows what will happen now? The fall is contagious as much as fear is, and it spreads like wildfire, it speeds up, accelerates and burns every corner of the global financial markets. Some say we need to burn sometimes, but c’mon, it’s way better to ride the waves of a bull market than suffer the burn of a bear market. If you can short, that’s good for you, you should have been shorting from 26,000. Bully for you, you’re actually making a packet right now, and it’s going to drop further. Silicon valley, the place where all the big geeks and companies live will be hit, we’re talking Google, Amazon and Facebook. Their fat smiles will be wiped off their faces as tech stocks smash into the ground leaving their once-upon-a-time billionaire faces nursing some serious smacked ass hole grimaces. Come to think of it, the carnage is only just beginning and the VIX tells all. Two things rule this world, FEAR and GREED. The carrot or the stick. At this moment in time, that stick is beating down hard, and if you don’t get your money out, there won’t be a pension, there won’t be a nice holiday home, or a retirement fund, it will all be a dream people once had, and it’s all gone, like a sniff of the panties of that girl you had only once, never to be encountered ever again.",1
"The reality The Dow may have dropped 1,500 from a high of 26k, but look on the bright side folks, inflation is rising at an astronomical level. What that means is everything just keeps getting more expensive. Your credit cards, mortgages and all the other shit created by bankers to siphon off money from your wallets at ridiculously high rates. Will we see further drops in the stockmarket? Ah, it’ll go sideways here for awhile, consolidation, then up a teeny bit, but mostly down from now on. Don’t blame Trump, this is cyclical, and cannot be controlled. We wrote about the bubble popping awhile ago, last year to be precise, and here we are. The Dow dropping 1,600 points is a drop in the ocean though when the market falls 60% then there will be cause for concern. How can you tell where the bottom is? That’s a hard one, almost like trying to find the highest high, but the lowest low will be the place where buying interest starts again. At the moment the stockmarket is so overbought that there is no intrinsic link to reality in the economy. Corrections are a natural phase. There may be acceleration in momentum on the downside, if this occurs, don’t bother phoning the broker, the phone will be off the hook. Just gently put your head between your legs and kiss your stocks goodbye. Sit back, break out the Schlitz, dip in the popcorn, and fucking relax…but only if you sold everything like yesterday.",1
"A recently unveiled EU poster sports the oppressive Soviet hammer and sickle symbol numerous times T he EU is a Soviet construct utilising collectivist techniques to strip former sovereign nations of their ability to construct their own laws, and dictating fiscal rules that rob former nations of making their own economic decisions. Ruled by an unelected core of technocrats, the EU Commission, they answer to no one, unlike a democracy where elected officials answer to an electorate. Ask any European to name one single person who rules over them in the EU Commission, and you will get a blank answer. The sad part about this is that the regular EU citizen is not phased by this, instead they go on living their simple lives without questioning anything. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet officials in the Eastern German communist government were integrated into the EU ruling hierarchy. Today we are seeing the fruits of their endeavours, with an EU so closely integrated that it is nigh on impossible for a nation to remove itself from the dictatorial structure. The UK may never leave the EU because of the various Marxist economic rules intertwined within its makeup. In the unlikely event that Britain does manage to escape this Eurocommunist construct, one can only pity the nations left behind, who will have the rest of their sovereignty eviscerated and integrated into ‘Ever Closer Union’. To see the proud Gaelic Irish race, who fought tooth and nail to gain freedom from rule for thousands of years, join the EU without even a whimper, not even a fight is sad beyond belief. These proud fighters have condemned their nation and people to be ruled as slaves by Brussels, where their every move is dictated, where their every law is ordered and where their every economic decision is instated without their say. To fight for thousands of years, then surrender your sovereignty without a single fight is a sign that there are defeated people amongst us, and the Irish are a lost race in the EU. Socialists, Marxists, and ill-informed actors, always cite Winston Churchill as wanting this communist sovietised EU construct, but they are wrong, Churchill hated communism, and to see a massive communist bloc emerge in Europe would have frightened his political sensibilities. His vision of a European future was to see an Anglo-Franco union, but this never happened. Instead, we now have a Germano-Franco union ruling over the subsidiary countries. The Soviet style that the EU has adopted is more of a Maoist modern Chinese communistic counterpart incorporating little utopian bits like the free-movement amongst all states Schengen Zone. EU communism can also be coined as the New Communism, or Eurocommunism. Economically speaking, the EU values capitalism, and yet is communist, much like China which embraces free market capitalism opposed to communist economics, yet is still a communist state. Mikhail Gorbachev once commented after the fall of the Berlin wall: “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Current Russian leader, Vladimir Putin has said: “Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.” And from this disintegration of Old Soviet Russia came a New Soviet EUnion construct deep in the heart of Europe, called the European Union, and in the future, it will admit what it really is, ‘The Soviet European Union’. As for Russia, the plan probably highest in EU military circles, within the newly formed EU Army will be integration of Russia. From there, Putin and his cronies will have their old Soviet state back, that is if they survive the purges. Modern communism within the EU is softened down version much like China, where religion is tolerated relatively, and there is heavy use of censorship to limit alternative viewpoints to its socialist ideologies. In essence, the EU wants to spread as far as it can go. The planners deep in the EU Commission would like the EU to take over the world economically, much like they have conquered European nations, without a single shot being fired. What the EU is is the Fourth Reich backwards. Where Hitler began militarily to conquer Europe, the EU conquered Europe economically. Once this was completed, this is when it was safe to talk about creating an EU Army so as not create fear amongst its conquered subjects. The future of Europe is one that will be fraught with conflict thanks to the aspirations of the unelected leaders of the EU who will invariably coax Russia into skirmishes along the borders. It was EU meddling in the Ukraine that finally awoke the sleeping bear, and Putin decided enough was enough. There will be more of these incidents occurring, until the Russian bear is mobilised completely, and the EU leaders will have what they want, a full conventional ground war, and more of a reason for ever closer union.

"Much to the chagrin of Democrats and socialists, President Donald Trump is such a success, that the American Heritage Foundation (AHF) has reserved a place for the president on Mount Rushmore. The foundation’s secretary, Janice Anderson, was adamant that president Trump deserved the honour of being remembered on Mount Rushmore with all of America’s other great presidents forever. “President Donald Trump has brought America up again after many years of stagnation under that other guy. The economy is zooming ahead, manufacturing, exports, oil production, jobs, and low unemployment. The stock market just rises and rises beyond any levels we could have ever dreamed of, and the Democrats are dumbfounded, lost, and speechless. What Mr. Trump has done for the American people is beyond anything we have seen ever, and he’s got more, there’s more to come. The Teflon Don. What a guy? What a prez!” According to tradition, the Mount Rushmore Donald Trump statue would be completed a few years after he leaves office. “We have commissioned the finest sculptors from Italy to come here and complete the statue. It would take about one and a half years to complete. The sculptors have also compensated for the Don’s haircut, which would effectively make the statue 75 feet taller than the other statues, but we are sure that would be pleasing to the president. “Donald Trump’s head would go next to Abraham Lincoln’s, as there is a spot there ready for crafting. Altogether, the statue will cost the US taxpayer $42 million, that’s a drop in the ocean compared to what Donald Trump has brought to America economically.”",1
"Four Japanese tourists who ordered a fish platter consisting of one slice of trout, one slice of salmon and a few lettuce leaves, plus a round of cokes to drink were astounded to receive a bill from the Trattoria Mafiosi, in St Marks Square, for 450,000 euros. “Like all the dumb Japs, they paid up and left,” Luigi Montagna, the eatery’s laughing 5″1 owner told the local Venetian news. To say it is dangerous to eat in Venice if you are a foreigner is an understatement. The unscrupulous restaurant owners love to rip off tourists who they think don’t know better. “The tourist he say to me he want a lasagne. I slap on a teaspoon of mincemeat, half cook, then throw on a piece of lettuce over the top. He smile like it best Italian food in world. I charge him 670 euros not including tax. He leaves happy, I leave restaurant straight to my mistress, happy. We all happy, innit?” another Venetian restauranter revealed with jocularity. It takes fucking balls to charge someone that amount of money for a mediocre meal and get away with it. We asked an Italian psychologist what kind of person could get away with such behaviour? The balls of an Italian – Avercele “Balls! Avercele! Only an Italian can charge such large amounts. We have the biggest hairy balls in the world. As a man during the day, you have to touch your balls every few minutes, you know pat them, treat them nice. This is why Italian restaurants can charge obscene amounts of money to tourists and get away with it, like nothing happened. Balls. That’s what Pacino said in Scarface, the only thing that give orders is Balls. Women can’t do this shit, they don’t have the balls, and they don’t have Italian balls, the biggest fucking balls in the fucking world. That’s why we drive Ferraris and Lamborghini. That’s why we shoot for goal from halfway line, that’s why we can charge a Japanese tourist 750,000% over the normal asking price — Balls!” Professor of Psychology at Venice University, Gianluca Palle, revealed. The Venetian Tourist Board advised all visitors to Venice to be prepared to be ripped off at all restaurants as it is an “Italian customary right to inflict ridiculous prices on tourists”. In November 2017, a British tourist dubbed a Venice restaurant “horrible and disgusting” after being charged €25,526 (£22,420) for lunch for three. The tourist from Coventry ate with his parents at Trattoria Stronzo in the central San Marco district, ordering a spread of food and sharing it between them. Italian restaurants often charge by weight rather than portion, and the restaurant denied any wrongdoing. Venice mayor Luigi Coglione introduced fines last year of 2,000 euros to dissuade tourists from littering, walking around topless and other acts deemed inappropriate, but also said tourists “need to shell out a bit” when eating in the city, following criticisms of extortionate bills at restaurants.",1
"Hylas and the Nymphs by John William Waterhouse, 1896 When it comes to the #metoo new puritanism that is sweeping the politically correct sovietized West, there is no place sacrosanct. Now that the art world and museums are being targeted worldwide by the cultureless puritans and their ISIS-like penchant for erasing history with destruction, new levels of censorship and banning are being reached daily. “I saw a Roman statue of a female nymph. The statue objectifies the female form and accentuates her breasts and privates. This is disgusting. We should ban everything Roman,” one social justice warrior yelled at the British museum’s Roman section. The woman was then pointed towards the Greek section of the museum where she went even more hysterical after spying a sculpture of a Greek Goddess fellating a male lion according to some myth or something. Of course the sculpture of a nude woman objectifies the female form, that is what art is meant to do, it is meant to present this piece of stone, then transform it into this wonderful curvaceous objectification of the beautiful female form. It is in essence a celebration of the female. What the fuck is wrong with that? Sculptures and painters have been doing it for thousands of years. Celebration of Fertility Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting “The Origin of the World” The vagina and vulva have been depicted in art from prehistory to the contemporary art era of the 21st century. Visual art forms representing the female genitals encompass two-dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g. statuettes). As long ago as 35,000 years ago, people sculpted Venus figurines that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. Feminist activist Gina Warte, has applauded an obscure Manchester art gallery — which will either hopefully be burned to the ground or attendance dropped to zero — that recently threw out a Waterhouse painting depicting some salacious nymphs coaxing a man into a pond. This pre-Raphaelite masterpiece has now been consigned to the bin thanks to the feminazi puritans. “This Waterhouse painting showed a vile depiction of young women as objects in a pond asking a man to join them. In 2018 wimmin hate men and we would never ask a man to join us in the water only if we could drown the bastard. I myself have never slept with a man or had relations with a man because I have big arms, a hairy chest and my vulva looks like a pair of testicles dangling between my legs. I am therefore angry at men for rejecting me.” All galleries worldwide were warned in a global poster campaign funded by shady socialist groups that they have until next week to remove all depictions of women from all galleries, especially if nude. John D. Salinger, a gallery owner from New York was not amused by the anti-art, anti-female form puritanical activism that has been going around. “Puritans have a choice. They can stay away from the art gallery, they can switch off, they can hide in their room, but for fuck’s sake, let us other people enjoy what we’ve been enjoying for thousands of years, i.e. the female nude body. Just go and shoot yourself in your brainwashed nazi brain.”",1
"W omen in film have not only had a hard time on the so-called ‘casting couch’ throughout history, but at the celebration of film, the yearly Oscars ceremonies where sadly women have suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, by being trumped on the podium by male actors/producers/directors. Betway Insider has analysed the dire situation for women at the Academy Awards. Out of 442 Oscar ceremonies, only five women have ever been nominated for Best Director. This massive discrepancy can also be followed by the statistic that out of the five nominations, only one woman has ever won an Oscar for directing, and that’s Kathryn Bigelow – ‘Hurt Locker’ at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010. Greta Gerwig, was nominated for ‘Lady Bird’ at the 2017 Academy Awards, the first since Kathryn Bigelow in 2010. The other female directors nominated for Best Director were: Lina Wertmuller, ‘Seven Beauties’ (1977), Jane Campion, ‘The Piano’ (1994) and Sofia Coppola, ‘Lost in Translation’ (2004). In an industry dominated by men, the film industry has to change its inherent bias, and address the multitude of female talent whether in acting or direction. Who would ever think that a film celebrating woman power like ‘Wonder Woman’ and actress Gal Gadot was completely snubbed at the 2017 Academy Awards? This says it all. As for screenwriting, only 14 out of a possible 162 winners have been women at the Academy Awards. It was not until the 64th Academy Awards in 1992 that a solo female screenwriter was honoured with an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and that was ‘Thelma and Louise’ writer, Callie Khouri. Three female screenwriters have won the award since then: Jane Campion, ‘The Piano’ (1994), Sofia Coppola, ‘Lost in Translation’ (2004) and Diablo Cody, ‘Juno’ (2008). Betway Insider Outlining the other categories at the Academy Awards, a woman has never won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, or even been nominated for the award until 2017 when Rachel Morrison was nominated for ‘Mudbound’. The only category that has produced the most female winners is Best Costume Design, with 58 of the possible 86 awards going to women. So why is this happening? Women have as much talent behind and in front of the screen as men. Should women not be treated equally in Hollywood with regards to their capacity for talent in important film roles? Well, the reasons for this bias can only be found in the fact the Academy is a male-dominated industry. As of 2018, 72 percent of Oscar voters are men. Only two women have ever hosted the Oscars solo: Whoopi Goldberg and Ellen DeGeneres, who have done so six times between them (1994, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2007 and 2014). In comparison, a man has hosted the ceremony on his own 56 times. Will Hollywood, and the Academy Awards ever address this massive bias towards women, or will it always brush this subject under the red carpet as it always seems to do? Now is the time, in the millenium, to finally bring forth women in the industry’s important roles, and to say goodbye to the old days, and old way of thinking.",1
"A s paramedics carried the Daily Squib fan to the hospital on a stretcher, he begged his friends to keep on reading satirical articles for him, according to a report on Chinese media. The man, Long Tam Rei Ding, 23, allegedly started reading the Daily Squib from the evening of January 27 until his friends called for an ambulance in the afternoon of January 28. According to Chinese news site QQ.com, Long Tam Rei Ding was trying to go to the toilet when he realised he couldn’t move the lower part of his body at an internet cafe in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province. One of his friends, who was at the scene, was quoted as saying: ‘It seems he had lost sensation completely, and couldn’t move at all. The only thing he had was a huge erection that would not go down. The medic called it a priapism or something. We had to call for an ambulance.’ It remains unclear what article the man had been reading at the time. A video shows the man’s friend and paramedics working together to move the man from a chair to a stretcher. The man is reportedly under hospital observation. Satire Addiction Satire addiction has become a prominent societal issue among the young people in China, with an increasing number of young people choosing to ignore their studies, social lives and family to surf the web for quality satire. Last October, a 21-year-old woman in China became blind in one eye after reading Daily Squib articles on her mobile phone non-stop for six days. She was thankfully cured after the doctor told her to read the Squib for a further six days with her remaining eye. Sadly she now cannot close her eyelids and has a permanent stare dubbed the ‘1000 mile Squib stare’.",1
"When the Conservative party is no longer conservative, when Britain is preferred to be a nation ruled by others with laws governing the UK, why not go for Jeremy Corbyn as the next inhabitant of Number 10? In essence, the whole of the system has gone to pot anyway, so let us reach out for more chaos, more disorder. Let us bite the bullet in ridiculousness, in utter monstrous change that ruins Britain further, because this nation has already gone way below any viable meter, it has in fact plumbed the depths of depravity that can never be fixed ever again. When we have members of the Conservative party openly deriding Britain, openly causing harm on the country and plotting its fall, and these people are applauded, they are not thrown headfirst from the Tory party, no, they are allowed to continue to create discord, to plot with Brussels, to receive payment from the nation’s enemies to hurt Britain and its interests. There is no hope in the Conservative party, and their stance on Brexit is the defining moment when the people who championed the Tories once should punish them dearly by voting and supporting Jeremy Corbyn to come to power and his high tax, unholy crusade to punish the rich, to punish the royals, and to punish the landed classes with his antithesis to capitalism, and his Soviet Marxist ideals of collectivisation. Yes, the country would fall even further into debt, and multiple generations of Britons would be saddled with paying that off, but the Tories squandered their chance, especially with the unelection of Theresa May as PM. It is too late, it is too far gone to say anything else other than let us unite behind the communist shisters in Momentum and their champagne socialist Islington affairs resplendent with the horrendous Marxist agenda brought upon by Comrade Corbyn. Let us support the grey bearded, red socked, sandalled one who shall step over the hallowed doorstep of Number 10, Downing Street, and defile the very corridors, and rooms that Margaret Thatcher once resided. The blood, crimson, bubbling with ardour and oozing from the blue stained Tories is one that has come to be poured into a bucket, and tipped gently over the head of Theresa May. She had her chance, she squandered it. Now, she and the country will be punished forever by a Corbyn win — a pure hell that will envelope the nation like a dark tumultuous curtain of death. Not only will Labour condemn the nation to hell economically, but it will also turn around any EU Brexit wins, of which there are none, and soon we will all be embroiled in a euro currency, and forever servitude to the dastardly EU. No one had the balls to stand up to Theresa May. Not one single Tory stood up. Not one. This is why Jeremy Corbyn should be the correct punishment for the Tory apathy, and silence. And as Edmund Burke once said: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men should do nothing.”",1
"Theresa May and her Remainer Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, and all the other Remainers who are in charge of the watered down Brexit are a key factor in Britain’s democracy dying a death so horrible that to look upon the UK as a democratic country with its own sovereign laws ever again will be met only with sickening laughter. Such is the watering down process by the insipid May, who has capitulated to every EU demand without even a word, that her contempt for the British people and their wishes is all too evident. How Britain has fallen from once a proud nation, sailing the high seas, conquering new lands, trading worldwide, exporting their wares, and importing other products. The death of Brexit ultimately means the death of democracy, from whence the vultures and crooked scum traitors sold off their country for a pittance and aided our enemies against the Crown. The people of Britain are thus deemed worthless, they are mere chattel to be thrown from one place to another without say, democracy, a long forgotten memory amongst the dead eyed treasonous traitors who take backhanders from Brussels and defend their immoral ill gotten gains by backstabbing the voter. Contempt for democracy, contempt for law, contempt for the will of the people, and contempt for Britain’s honour, only shame remains, shame and cowardice. The crooked have won, as Tony Blair laughs into the faces of the British people, he gains more riches off their misery, and he laughs even more, the delight of getting away with treason, getting away with all that he has done, the blood soaked membranes of dead Iraqi children moulded into each and every mansion he owns with his evil witch wife. Theresa May is a cowardly grey mutt, a withering faltering non-entity who has succumbed to the EU, she has sold the British nation to the dogs, condemned us to many more years of transitionary purgatory, just as her barren womb aches for a child, she herself aches for redemption from the people who she has so callously betrayed. A stinking rotten womb black with injustice to the British people, Theresa May is a malevolent tawdry puss filled pustule that will one day burst onto her gilded mirror, a gooey reminder of what she really is, and how she cannot sleep at night any more. None of them who betrayed Britain should ever be allowed to forget their crimes of treason, their abandonment of democracy and their treacherous selling of Britain to our enemies and their corpulent envelopes filled with dirty euros handed to them under tables, in dark alleys, and EU offices. Betrayal of the fundamental tenets of democracy is what they have done by watering down Brexit. If one cannot hold a democratic referendum and have the result stick, what hope is there for democracy? We all know that the EU, a body of unelected officials does not value democracy, BUT BRITAIN SHOULD VALUE DEMOCRACY! You cannot have a referendum and then say it was not the right answer you wanted then have another one, then another one until you get the correct answer according to your nefarious agenda? That IS NOT DEMOCRACY! The people were assured that the result of the EU Referendum, held on June 23, 2016, would stand. This result was agreed to be respected by all parties, but they did not, and this is why we are here now in the year 2018, with a watered down Brexit in name only. We have had enough of Theresa May. She has delayed, allowed Remainers to dictate what happens, and she has agreed to all EU terms without question. Theresa May is inoperative. There is no other way than to oust this fucking turkey, and put her in the oven. Get some fucking balls someone and get up, oust Theresa May right now. Decisions can be made in less than thirty seconds, do not think, ACT. You must do this right now, to save Britain from an un-democratic future under the EU. This is a fight for Western Democratic rights, it is a fight for our right to make our own laws, our own sovereign national state, it is a fight for the basic tenets of δημοκρατία dēmokratía, or “rule of the people” NOT by unelected faceless Eurocrat officials from the European Commission. NO!",1
"hansard.parliament.uk Somewhere under here is the answer to the problems we are dealing with today. Can you spot the elusive solution? The Prime Minister (Mrs. Margaret Thatcher) With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council held in Rome on 27 and 28 October, which I attended with my right hon. Friend Douglas Hurd the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. The conclusions of the Council have been placed in the Library of the House. The Council had to deal in the first place with some urgent items of current business: namely, the Community’s failure to agree a negotiating position on agriculture for the Uruguay round of trade negotiations; the situation in the Gulf, and the position of the foreign nationals held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait; and the problems which have arisen in Hungary. Looking further ahead, the Council also dealt with the preparations for the two intergovernmental conferences, on economic and monetary union and also on institutional reform, which are due to begin in December. I shall report on the Council’s business in that order. The Uruguay round of trade negotiations is due to be completed before the end of this year. The outcome will decide whether world trade becomes steadily more open, or we repeat the mistakes of the past and relapse into protectionism. The most difficult item is agriculture. All the major participants in the Uruguay round committed themselves to table negotiating offers by 15 October. All except the European Community have done so. The Community has been discussing this problem since the round began in the autumn of 1986. It gave an unequivocal commitment in April last year to make substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support. That commitment was repeated at the Houston economic summit in July this year. The Commission has put forward a proposal for 30 per cent. reductions, backdated to 1986. So what has already been done by way of reduction of support since then will be set against that 30 per cent. There have been six sessions of European Community Ministers to discuss the proposal. The most recent, lasting some 16 hours, was on Friday last week. But no agreement has been reached. The main opposition has come from France and Germany. The Community’s failure has harmed its reputation. Negotiations between the leading groups of countries cannot start until the Community’s proposals have been tabled. The European Council requested Ministers to meet again and put the Commission in a position to table a negotiating offer. The Netherlands Prime Minister suggested that the basis for this should be the position reached when Agriculture Ministers suspended their work early on 27 October. But President Mitterrand made it clear that France would continue to vote against those proposals. It remains for Agriculture and Trade Ministers to try yet again to reach a conclusion. If we fail, it will give a signal to the world that the Community is protectionist. Next, with regard to the Gulf and the position of the hostages, the European Council agreed a firm statement calling for Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait and confirming Europe’s absolute commitment to full implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The [column 870]statement makes it clear that we shall consider further steps if Iraq does not comply. The message is that Saddam Hussein must not gain anything from his aggression. The Council also strongly condemned Iraq for holding foreign nationals as hostages and for using them in an unscrupulous way. This is totally unacceptable. Moreover, Iraq is negotiating over the hostages with the purpose of trying to divide the international community. After considerable discussion, the Council affirmed our determination not to send representatives of our Governments in any capacity to negotiate with Iraq for the release of hostages, and to discourage others from doing so. I believe that the unity of the Twelve, and our determination not to allow Saddam Hussein to divide us on the question of hostages, will send a very powerful signal to Iraq. The third point is assistance to Hungary. In the course of the Council, member states received appeals from the Government of Hungary for help in dealing with the serious problems that have arisen as a result of the reduction in the supply of oil from the Soviet Union. The consequent price rises have given rise to unrest. The Council issued a strong statement of support for Hungary in pursuing its path towards democratic and economic reforms and the rule of law. The Council also agreed, at the United Kingdom’s suggestion, to bring forward and disburse rapidly the second instalment of the $1 billion Community loan for Hungary which we agreed last year. This will be of direct practical assistance. Those were the urgent matters on which the Council had to act. Looking further to the future, we also discussed the preparations for the two intergovernmental conferences, or IGCs, which will start their work on 14 December. For the conference on political union, the Council had before it a report by Foreign Ministers listing a wide range of possible institutional changes which the intergovernmental conference might consider. Heads of Government called for further work to be done on these proposals between now and December. My right hon. Friend Douglas Hurdthe Foreign Secretary and I argued that it would be wrong to prejudge the conclusions of the intergovernmental conference. We were on strong ground, since the Community’s original decision to call the conference specified that it should set its own agenda. Nevertheless, others wished to give specific directions to the IGC. We therefore reserved the United Kingdom’s position on, for example, extension of the Community’s powers into new areas, greater powers for the European Parliament in the legislative sphere, defining European citizenship, and a common foreign and security policy. All these are issues for discussion at the intergovernmental conference itself rather than to be settled in advance. On economic and monetary union, I stressed that we would be ready to move beyond the present position to the creation of a European monetary fund and a common Community currency which we have called a hard ecu. But we would not be prepared to agree to set a date for starting the next stage of economic and monetary union before there is any agreement on what that stage should comprise. And I again emphasised that we would not be prepared to have a single currency imposed upon us, nor to surrender the use of the pound sterling as our currency. The hard ecu would be a parallel currency, not a single currency. If, as time went by, people and Governments chose to use it widely, it could evolve towards a single [column 871]currency. But our national currency would remain unless a decision to abolish it were freely taken by future generations of Parliament and people. A single currency is not the policy of this Government. I should like to offer four comments in conclusion. First, the Community finds it more difficult to take the urgent, detailed decisions than to discuss longer-term concepts. Moreover, no one should underestimate the extent to which national interests prevail among those who most proclaim their Community credentials. Secondly, Britain intends to be part of the further political, economic and monetary development of the European Community. That is what the great majority of member states want, too. When we come to negotiate on particular points, rather than concepts or generalities, I believe that solutions will be found which will enable the Community to go forward as Twelve. That will be our objective. Thirdly, we are fighting in Europe for British farmers, for British consumers, for a new world trade agreement, for help to the newly democratic countries of eastern Europe, and for the interests and concerns of our people. Fourthly, while we fully accept our commitments under the treaties and wish to co-operate more closely with other countries in the European Community, we are determined to retain our fundamental ability to govern ourselves through Parliament. I believe that that is the wish of this House, and we on this side will do our best to see that it is fulfilled. Mr. Neil Kinnock (Islwyn) I thank the right hon. Lady for that statement and welcome the summit statements on, first, the complete solidarity of the Governments of the Community countries against Saddam Hussein and, secondly, economic support for the Soviet Union, Hungary and other central and east European countries. On the central matter discussed in Rome, is it not clear that last weekend the Prime Minister managed to unite the rest of the European Community against her, to divide her own party and, more importantly, further to weaken the influence that Britain needs in order properly to uphold our national interests in the European Community? Can the Prime Minister tell us why she was apparently taken by surprise by the proposals put by others in Rome? Does she not recall that in 1985 she whipped and guillotined the Single European Act through the House, in June 1989 at Madrid she formally agreed with other heads of Government to be determined to achieve the progressive realisation of economic and monetary union, and at the Dublin summit this year she agreed to intensify the process of European union in economic, monetary and political terms? Those were all steps which raised comment at the time. Did she not know what she was doing on those occasions, or was she living in cloud cuckoo land? The Prime Minister says that the Government would not surrender the use of the pound sterling as our currency. Perhaps she will therefore tell us how she regards the advice of her fellow Conservative, Commissioner Brittan, when he said: “YOU DON’T HAVE TO LOSE THE POUND STERLING UNDER THE SINGLE CURRENCY PLAN. YOU CAN PERFECTLY WELL HAVE A NOTE OR A COIN WHICH STATES ITS VALUE IN POUNDS … AND ITS FIXED EQUIVALENT IN ECU … IT’S BEEN AGREED THAT THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE.” On the connection between currency and sovereignty, can the Prime Minister, who abandoned her own Madrid conditions before she put sterling into the exchange rate mechanism, tell the House what will be her conditions now [column 872]for putting sterling into the narrow banding of the ERM? The Prime Minister could come to a debate and explain all these things from the Dispatch Box if she was willing to do so. When the Prime Minister conducts herself as she did in Rome this weekend, is it any wonder that she cannot even get agreement for the necessary reduction in farm subsidies? [Interruption.] She has no influence at all. When she conducts herself as she does, is it any wonder that some members of her own party believe that she has undermined the Chancellor’s efforts to build support for the so-called hard ecu? Does she not realise that such an attitude makes the Heads of other Governments even less susceptible to listening to the sensible arguments that can be deployed in favour of sovereignty in the Community? Does she accept that it is reasonable to put the view that the determinants of the pace and direction of economic and monetary union should be the realities of economic performance and the degree of economic convergence, not arbitrary diary dates? Does the Prime Minister not understand that, with her method of conducting affairs, she is throwing away that sound argument and losing both potential allies and necessary influence? Does she not appreciate that, even now, her tantrum tactics will not stop the process of change or change anything in the process of change? All they do is strand Britain in a European second division without the influence over change that we need, the financial and industrial opportunities that we need and the sovereignty that we need. The Prime Minister It is our purpose to retain the power and influence of this House, rather than denude it of many of its powers. I wonder what the right hon. Gentleman’s policy is, in view of some of the things that he said. Would he have agreed to a commitment to extend the Community’s powers to other supplementary sectors of economic integration without having any definition of what they are? One would have thought, from what he said, that he would. The Commission wants to extend its powers and competence into health matters, but we said no, we would not agree to that. From what the right hon. Gentleman said, it sounded as though he would agree, for the sake of agreeing, and for being Little Sir Echo, and saying, “Me, too.” Would the right hon. Gentleman have agreed to extending qualified majority voting within the Council, to delegating implementing powers to the Commission, to a common security policy, all without any attempt to define or limit them? The answer is yes. He does not have a clue about the definition of some of the things that he is saying, let alone securing a definition of others. We have agreed to wait to give support to the Soviet Union until the IMF report is received. That is coming at the next summit. It was not we who stopped unity on agriculture—it was France and Germany. Had the right hon. Gentleman even read the statement, which he had before I came in, he would have noticed—and had he even listened to the statement when I made it, he would have known—that it was Francois Mitterrand who said that he would not agree to the Commission’s proposal. We are not to blame in any way for not reaching agreement on agriculture. But for the insistence of my right hon. Friend Douglas Hurdthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and me, the chair would not even have had the matter discussed, so urgent was it that [column 873]it should be. I told the chair over a week ago that, if the farm Ministers did not reach agreement, we must discuss the matter, and I wrote to him. He did everything that he could to see that a matter so urgent was not discussed, but we succeeded in getting it discussed. As to the right hon. Gentleman’s strictures about economic and monetary union, that phrase was agreed by the European Community before we went in. It is one of those things that we inherited. It was agreed in 1972. When it came to defining it—[Interruption.] We went into the Community in 1973, and I had understood that most Labour Members were in favour of that. I wonder today if they are changing their stance for the sake of debating points. Leon Brittan is a loyal member of the Commission. Yes, the Commission wants to increase its powers. Yes, it is a non-elected body and I do not want the Commission to increase its powers at the expense of the House, so of course we differ. The President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, said at a press conference the other day that he wanted the European Parliament to be the democratic body of the Community, he wanted the Commission to be the Executive and he wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. Perhaps the Labour party would give all those things up easily. Perhaps it would agree to a single currency and abolition of the pound sterling. Perhaps, being totally incompetent in monetary matters, it would be only too delighted to hand over full responsibility to a central bank, as it did to the IMF. The fact is that the Labour party has no competence on money and no competence on the economy—so, yes, the right hon. Gentleman would be glad to hand it all over. What is the point of trying to get elected to Parliament only to hand over sterling and the powers of this House to Europe? Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will understand his brief a little better next time. Mr. Nicholas Ridley (Cirencester and Tewkesbury) rose—— Hon. Members Speak for Germany. Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Ridley Mr. Ridley May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on standing up for the interests of the people of this country and ask her whether she thinks that the eleven are not now both isolated and intransigent in relation to agricultural policy and the GATT round? Does she think that they are deliberately working for the failure of the GATT round in order to achieve their objectives of a fortress Europe? If they are, does she agree that that is not a destination for which we want to board the train? The Prime Minister My right hon. Friend is right. The European community is the only group of nations which, after years of studying the problem, has not tabled an initial negotiating position on agriculture in the GATT round. The United States, Japan, the Cairns group, Canada and Switzerland have tabled theirs, but from the Community—nothing. It really is a disgrace that we have not even been able to agree on a negotiating position, let alone start to negotiate with all the other groups by between now and the end of the year. [column 874] Yes, I agree with my right hon. Friend that several countries in the Community are highly protectionist. The common agricultural policy is a protectionist policy, but we will try to reduce the protectionism, first because it would help the third world, secondly because it would mean that we would not have export subsidies—and thereby take business away from other countries—and thirdly because in this country we believe in open trade. This was the most serious matter to be discussed at the European Council, and I most earnestly hope that this time Agriculture Ministers—there will be no difficulty with us, but I mean the French and German Agriculture Ministers—will accept the proposals of the Commission for the negotiating position in the Uruguay round. Mr. Paddy Ashdown (Yeovil) Does the Prime Minister realise how welcome it was to hear in her statement that she has at last been forced to admit that the hard ecu proposal can be a transitional mechanism to a single currency? Will she congratulate the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary on levering her forward towards reality on that matter? Does she realise that that is good news for Britain? Does the right hon. Lady realise how much of her performance at Rome was bad news for Britain? Does she realise that in a single meeting she has isolated this country in Europe, weakened our voice in Europe, divided the Government and betrayed this country’s long-term best interests? Does she realise that if she faced a Labour party that was not equally divided, muddled and confused on this matter, she would today face a motion of no confidence in her failure at this historic moment? Does she realise—[Interruption.] Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Ashdown Does the Prime Minister realise that for as long as she hangs on to power, so long will Britain be held back from its future, and that she no longer speaks for Britain—she speaks for the past? The Prime Minister Oh dear, it seems that there must be quite a lot of late parrots in cloud cuckoo land, judging by the right hon. Gentleman coming out with that stuff. Of course, if there is a parallel currency and people choose to make more and more use of it, it could evolve into a single currency, but that could not be done without a decision coming back to this House and, I believe, to the people of this country. I take it that the right hon. Gentleman’s policy is to abolish the pound sterling, the greatest expression of sovereignty. In any event, it would be totally and utterly wrong to agree to that now. That matter is one to be decided by future generations and future Parliaments. Parliament is supreme, not the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Democrats. Mr. Robin Squire (Hornchurch) In the light of last weekend’s discussions, will my right hon. Friend reconsider in the near future the proposal to separate the Bank of England and make it independent so that it may serve as a buttress in this country’s battle against inflation? The Prime Minister Independent banks are mostly either answerable to a parliament—as in the United States, where Mr. Greenspan is answerable to Congress—or have a number of politicians on their boards. I do not believe that the structure that this country currently has would be [column 875]served well by the proposal that my hon. Friend mentions. It is far better to increase democracy than to reduce it, which I believe would be wrong at this time. Mr. James Lamond (Oldham, Central and Royton) What is the point of the Prime Minister trying to wrap herself in the union jack for electoral purposes—[Hon Members: “Better that than the red flag.” ]—and then coming to the Dispatch Box to tell the House that she is prepared to sell the working people of this country down the river by opening Britain up completely to free trade without any protectionism whatsoever, destroy the multi-fibre arrangement, and give the emerging democracies in Europe £1,000 million in loans to produce goods on wages of £80 a month, so that textiles in particular will flood into this country, which would destroy hundreds of thousands of British jobs? Is that what the right hon. Lady was elected to do? Is she really protecting this country, or is she only pretending to do so? The Prime Minister The hon. Gentleman probably heard the comment made by some of my right hon. and hon. Friends, “Better to wrap yourself in the union jack than the red flag.” The hon. Gentleman’s remarks amount to a totally protectionist policy, which would lead to retaliation against us, reduce the capability of our export industries and therefore our standard of living, and make our industries inefficient and therefore cost the housewife a great deal more. I note also that the hon. Gentleman complains about goods entering Britain from Third world countries where wages are far lower. I have heard the hon. Gentleman say several times in the House that Third world countries need help. They need trade as much as they need aid. Mr. Norman Tebbit (Chingford) Does my right hon. Friend agree that the mark of a single currency is not only that all other currencies must be extinguished but that the capacity of other institutions to issue currencies must also be extinguished? In the case of the United Kingdom, that would involve Parliament binding its successors in a way that it has hitherto regarded as unconstitutional. The Prime Minister I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. This Government have no intention of abolishing the pound sterling. If the hard ecu were to evolve and much greater use were to be made of it, that would be a decision for future Parliaments and generations. That decision could be taken only once. It should not be taken in the current atmosphere, but only after the greatest possible consideration. I believe that both Parliament and sterling have served this country and the rest of the world very well. We are more stable and influential with sterling, and it is an expression of our sovereignty. This Government believe in the pound sterling. Mr. James Molyneaux (Lagan Valley) Does the Prime Minister recall that Britain was in a minority of one in the Europe of 1940? Does she further agree that, 50 years on, the basic issue is still the same—undiluted parliamentary democracy and not imposed diktat? The Prime Minister I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. There are some things for which there was majority voting within the Community when we went in, and we accepted that, and for the specific objective of achieving the Single European Act only, there have been [column 876]more matters. Now there is an attempt to get far more things passed by majority voting. That means that we would have more laws imposed upon us, even if the House was flatly against them. We expect our people to obey the law, mainly because it has gone through all the legislative processes in this House, and we should be very slow to add to any majority competence on the part of the Community. Mr. Steve Norris (Epping Forest) Does my right hon. Friend accept that there is wide support in my constituency for the stance that she took at the intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union? Does she further accept that that support is based not on the niceties of international economics but on the clear and firm belief that those who dictate fiscal policy to the United Kingdom should be fully and directly answerable to its electors? The Prime Minister I totally agree with my hon. Friend. The Delors report is proposing that those people should be answerable to no one. It is very ironic indeed that, at a time when eastern Europe is striving for greater democracy, the Commission should be striving to extinguish democracy and to put more and more power into its own hands, or into the hands of non-elected bodies. Ms. Joyce Quin (Gateshead, East) Is it not true that the British Government are far more reluctant than Germany, France or Italy to give economic assistance to the Soviet Union? Is the Prime Minister not aware of the political risks within the Soviet Union if we do not respond generously at this time, and of the long-term risks for British industry if other countries step in and establish aid and trading relationships with the Soviet Union before we do? The Prime Minister The German banks—the Deutsche bank—made a considerable loan to the Soviet Union of some DM6 billion. That had all gone within a matter of weeks. It was guaranteed by the Government of the Federal Republic, and it was all gone in a matter of weeks—used to repay debts which the Soviet Union owed to German manufacturers. That has done nothing to help the economic situation in the Soviet Union. When we got the request for help, we suggested that we should not consider general loans which would not help a country that was already in difficulties, but should see if we could give specific help in certain spheres—for example food processing, transport and oil exploration. We are studying that, and the International Monetary Fund is judging what it is necessary for the Soviet economy to do to get it out of its present difficulties. Fortunately, between the Houston economic summit and now, the Soviet Union has had a windfall in the sense that the increasing price of oil has given it a much better balance of payments position on a much greater scale than here, so that has improved its position. We shall make up our minds when the IMF has reported. Mr. Cranley Onslow (Woking) If these partners of ours—France and Germany—persist in blocking the reform of the common agricultural policy in December, what useful purpose does my right hon. Friend think that the intergovernmental conference is likely to achieve? The Prime Minister My right hon. Friend puts his finger on it absolutely. Agriculture and trade are two [column 877]subjects in which, as national countries, we have no competence at all as it is all negotiated through the Community. They can therefore do that—they can even do it in the Agriculture Council—by majority voting. If France and Germany stick together and refuse to have reductions in their subsidies, many of the other countries where farmers are far poorer than those in France and Germany will say, “How in the world can we agree to lower subsidies when the Community’s two sets of richest farmers will not do so?” I hope that the compromise solution that the Commission hammered out with Agriculture Ministers will nevertheless go through, but that is only the start, not the end, of the negotiating position with other countries; otherwise, we shall be responsible for reducing world trade. Dr. David Owen (Plymouth, Devonport) Is it not perfectly clear that what was being attempted at Rome was a bounce which led only one way—to a single federal united states of Europe? Is it not vital that, in this House and across party lines, it should be possible for a Prime Minister to make it clear, if necessary, that Britain is prepared to stand alone? We should not relish it, but if we were faced with the imposition by treaty of a single currency and with a situation that prevented the enlargement of the Community to include Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, would not Britain be entitled and right to use the veto? The Prime Minister I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. That is precisely the stance that we took. It is the stance that we have taken on many previous occasions. The European monetary system to which we belong is designed for 12 sovereign states, in co-operation with one another, to come to an exchange rate mechanism. What is being proposed now—economic and monetary union—is the back door to a federal Europe, which we totally and utterly reject. We prefer greater economic and monetary co-operation, which can be achieved by keeping our sovereignty. Mr. Hugh Dykes (Harrow, East) Does my right hon. Friend agree and confirm that her words today mean in effect that she would prefer to withdraw from the treaty of Rome and the Single European Act? The Prime Minister No. We should like to have the kind of Europe that we believe in and the Europe that we went in to join. If my hon. Friend looks back at some of the speeches, he will see that we were absolutely assured that we should not be giving up sovereignty. That was the basis upon which we went in. On 24 May 1971 Edward Heaththe Prime Minister said: “WE AGREED IN PARTICULAR THAT THE IDENTITY OF NATIONAL STATES SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DEVELOPING COMMUNITY. THIS MEANS, OF COURSE, THAT, THOUGH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE FORUM IN WHICH IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE TAKEN, … IT PROVIDES A CLEAR ASSURANCE, … THAT JOINING THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT ENTAIL A LOSS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY OR AN EROSION OF ESSENTIAL NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.” —[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24 MAY 1971; VOL. 818, C. 32–33.] Mr. Nigel Spearing (Newham, South) Despite what the Prime Minister has just said, is it not clear that it is the [column 878]wish of our partners that there should be a loss of national identity on currency? Is it not true that even the hard ecu, coupled with fixed exchange rates, would lead inexorably to economic and monetary union and to government either of bankers for bankers by bankers or to a strong political central government that would usher in a new Euro-state? If the Prime Minister is to save Britain as a self-governing nation, had she not better make that clear and galvanise the people of this country and all parties in Parliament to say a very polite no to economic and monetary union? The Prime Minister If I believed that, I would do just as the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not believe that his interpretation is correct. I accept that many in the Economic Community would like to have their version of economic and monetary union, which would lead to passing powers away from national Parliaments to a non-elected body—in fact, to a central board of bankers—to majority voting and to the giving of more legislative power to the European Parliament. That is their version, but it is not the version that we have accepted. The Single European Act defined economic and monetary union as “Co-operation in Economic and Monetary policy” . That is all you need, in my view. The hard ecu is a proposal that does not require a central bank, which would make it an inflation-proof currency and which could be used if people chose to do so. In my view, it would not become widely used throughout the Community—[Interruption.]—possibly most widely used for commercial transactions. Many people would continue to prefer their own currency. Therefore, I do not believe that the fears of the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) will happen. I am pretty certain that most people in this country would prefer to continue to use sterling. If, by their choice, I was wrong, there would come a time when we would have to address the question. However, that would not be for us but for future generations in the House. Mr. Terence Higgins (Worthing) Will my right hon. Friend take time between now and the conference in December to explain to her European colleagues what any first-year economic student could tell them, which is that the imposition of a single currency, as opposed to a common currency, would rule out for all time the most effective means of adjusting for national differences in costs and prices? Will she explain that that in turn would cause widespread unemployment, which would probably exist on a perpetual basis, and very serious financial imbalances? The Prime Minister Yes, I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. It would do just that. It would also mean that there would have to be enormous transfers of money from one country to another. It would cost us a great deal of money. One reason why some of the poorer countries want it is that they would get those big transfers of money. We are trying to contest that. If we have a single currency or a locked currency, the differences come out substantially in unemployment or vast movements of people from one country to another. Many people who talk about a single currency have never considered its full implications. Mr. Jim Sillars (Glasgow, Govan) Will the Prime Minister ignore the advice of the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen), who talked about the British state standing alone? Will she bear in mind her humiliating experience when she was forced into the ERM [column 879]against all her instincts and her declaration in Madrid? Is the Prime Minister aware that many people in Europe, not only in the United Kingdom, are aware of the formidable economic, political and social problems inherent in stage 2 and moving to a single currency? Does she not think that she would have a far better chance of getting people to talk about a sensible and cautious approach if, in addressing her colleagues in Europe, she used the moderate language of a 21st-century European and not the intemperate language of a little Englander? The Prime Minister Bearing in mind that the hon. Gentleman was not there, will he tell me of any language that was intemperate? Those who seem to know most about this are the people who were not there and heard nothing of what was said or of the way in which it was done. Radio and television broadcasts are outside and after the finish of the conference. We have always said that we would join the exchange rate mechanism when the time was right. That was part of our going into the European monetary system, to which we have belonged for many years. We have put some of our reserves with the European monetary system and have the usual swap arrangements that that entails. The completion of the European monetary system is the exchange rate mechanism. All that can be done by nation states co-operating with one another. We do not need to have a federal structure at all. The time came when most of the other countries had abolished their foreign exchange controls and we had led them, way ahead. Yes, I think that it was we and Germany who were isolated in that we got rid of foreign exchange controls first. The others followed, but Spain still has not done so. When they had done that, and when we adjudged that the time was right—I think that every figure that has come out since has indicated that we were right in our timing of joining the ERM and in reducing the interest rate—we completed our obligation to join. That does not mean that we agree with the next stage, which is a totally different definition of economic and monetary union. Mr. Anthony Nelson (Chichester) Does my right hon. Friend agree that the prospects for the British people enjoying a higher standard of living and sharing in greater prosperity will depend in no small part on securing a currency that is strong and stable—something that has dogged us in the post-war years? Is that not more likely to be achieved if we have a common currency based on the great economies of Western Europe rather than relying on our going it alone? The Prime Minister No, I think that many of my colleagues in Europe—in our European Council and certainly in the Finance Council—will say that there is no way in which there can be a single currency until all economies are at the same state of development, the same state of prosperity and in a Europe with one economy right across it. I do not think that there is any possibility of that stage being reached for a very long time. To take a single currency long before that has happened would be to weaken it and not to strengthen it. We will have a stronger sterling, with all its history. Many securities and contracts are denominated in sterling. We shall trade better with the great history behind sterling than we possibly could with a single currency. [column 880] Mr. Ron Leighton (Newham, North-East) There is no majority in the House for EMU, but is the Prime Minister aware that I attended a conference in Italy last year at which an Italian Minister spoke to me about EMU? I said, “What if Mrs. Thatcher opposes it?” Ungallantly, he laughed out loud and said, “We have met Mrs. Thatcher many times—she squawks and makes a noise at the beginning but always comes round and gives way in the end.” What assurances and guarantees can the Prime Minister give the House that she will not give way on this issue, as she gave way on the Madrid condition about British inflation before joining the ERM? The Prime Minister That is what they said when I was negotiating for a better budget deal for Britain. Twice, the people in the Commission—our people in the Commission and the presidency of the Commission—advised me to give way. They found out differently. Mr. Paul Channon (Southend, West) Does my right hon. Friend agree—— Hon. Members We cannot hear. Mr. Speaker Order. Hon. Members are not alone in that. Mr. Channon Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a grave risk that unless the Community can get its negotiating position together the GATT round of talks may collapse in the next few months? If that happens, it would be no dry, academic exercise but would mean higher costs for consumers in many countries in the next few years. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Community’s compromise proposals on agriculture, which have been rejected, are ludicrously modest? Will she urge our colleagues in the Community to try to reach a solution—if not now, at least during the next IGC? The Prime Minister I agree with my right hon. Friend. If we do not reach a solution in Geneva in the Uruguay round, it will mean retaliation against us, and people’s worst fears—that the Economic Community is nothing but a fortress Europe and a protectionist club—will be realised. If we did not get a result on the agriculture round, it would not be our fault but the fault of France and Germany. There are certain protectionist elements in France, as my right hon. Friend knows. Even when we get our own negotiating position, as I hope that we shall within a week, I hope that it will be on the basis that we have been negotiating for six previous meetings. We still have to have negotiations on the other proposals that we put up with all the countries. There is still a tough way to go before we get a conclusion, but the important thing—important for the welfare of all our people—is that that round meets with success. Mr. Jack Ashley (Stoke-on-Trent, South) A single European currency means loss of control over our monetary policy. Our monetary policy has been an absolute shambles, so what is the Prime Minister fussing about? The Prime Minister Monetary policy was in its greatest shambles under Labour, when inflation reached 27 per cent. Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston) Will my right hon. Friend make it clear that, if the procrastination about export subsidies by the European Community on surplus [column 881]food continues, with the result that the Uruguay round collapses and the United States then resorts to a protectionist policy in self-defence, the one country in the EC that will suffer will be the United Kingdom? The Prime Minister As my hon. Friend knows, we always try for open trading. We also try to defend our farmers to see that they get a fair deal because, mostly, the subsidies in Europe go to the smaller farmers. By subsidising the smaller farmers, the efficiency of the larger family farm is undercut. We will do everything that we can to ensure that the picture that my hon. Friend has painted does not come about. Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones(Ynys Môn) Does the Prime Minister agree that her isolation at the Rome summit will seriously damage Wales’s prospects of benefiting under the single market, and from the exports and investment opportunities that will arise? Does she also agree that Wales, which is on the periphery of Europe, needs to be at the heart of the decision-making process in Europe and that a positive approach to Europe is needed? Does not her isolationist stance prove that Wales needs direct representation in the Community institutions? The Prime Minister The hon. Gentleman’s strictures would have been better directed to France and Germany, which have taken an isolationist stance on agricultural subsidies for three years. It would have been very much better if they had come along with the rest instead of sticking out for their own farmers against the good of the EC as a whole. It was those countries which were isolated on that most urgent matter. As for investment, Wales—like the rest of the United Kingdom—has benefited enormously from the economic policies of this Government. We have brought in tons and tons of investment from overseas to Wales, to Scotland and to the north of England, greatly to the benefit of jobs here. People have great confidence in this Government, which is why they invest in Britain. What a pity the hon. Gentleman cannot speak up a little more for his own country. Mr. Tony Favell (Stockport) Next Wednesday, the doors of this Chamber will be closed to Black Rod as a symbol of the independence of this House. What would be the effect on the independence of this House and on the nation that elects it if the power to veto proposals affecting social affairs, the environment and taxation were to be removed? The Prime Minister I hope that, when the next election comes, people who want to come to the House will come to uphold its powers and its responsibilities, and not to denude the House of them. We have surrendered some of them to the Community, and in my view we have surrendered enough. Mr. Tony Benn (Chesterfield) Is the Prime Minister aware that what we are really discussing is not economic management, but the whole future of relations between this country and Europe? This issue is not best expressed in 19th-century patriotic language or in emotive language about which design is on the currency. The real question is whether, when the British people vote in a general election, they will be able to change the policies of the [column 882]previous Government. It is already a fact, as the House knows full well, that whatever Government are in power, our agricultural policy is controlled from Brussels, our trade policy is controlled from Brussels and our industrial policy is controlled from Brussels. If we go into EMU, our financial policy will also be controlled. It is a democratic argument, not a nationalistic argument. However, given that the right hon. Lady is a member of the Government who took us into the European Community without consulting the British people, given that she was Prime Minister in the Government who agreed to the Single European Act without consulting the British people, and given that she has now agreed to joining the exchange rate mechanism without consulting the British people, we find it hard to believe that she is really intent on preserving democracy rather than gaining political advantage by waving some national argument around on the eve of a general election. That is why we do not trust her judgment on the matter. The Prime Minister I think that I would put it just a little differently from the right hon. Gentleman, although I recognise some of the force of some of the points that he makes. When the Delors proposals for economic and monetary union came out, it was said immediately by my right hon. Friend Nigel Lawson the then Chancellor of the Exchequer that this was not really about monetary policy at all but about a back door to a federal Europe, taking many democratic powers away from democratically elected bodies and giving them to non-elected bodies. I believe fervently that that is true, which is why I shall have nothing to do with their definition of economic and monetary union. We shall continue the co-operation that we have come to establish, as nation states. The Act that enabled us to go into Europe was passed on Second Reading by eight votes and it was made very clear then that we would not surrender our national identity, that it was a matter of co-operation. It was on the strength of that that many people went in. I am afraid that it would be quite different if we went for a single European currency and a central bank and for their definition of economic and monetary union. Mr. Churchill (Davyhulme) Will my right hon. Friend tell the House how far she believes that, when the moment comes, Germany will be prepared to see the transfer of its monetary policy from the Bundesbank to a European central bank on which it will have one voice out of 12? The Prime Minister I think that it is wrong to think that all the Twelve have similar votes or influence in these matters. I think that some in Germany—only some—are backing the scheme because they know that the dominant voice, the predominant voice, on any central bank would be the German voice. If we did not retain our national identities in Europe, the dominant people in Europe would be German. The way to balance out the different views of Europe, as we have traditionally done throughout history, is by retaining our national identity. Mr. Andrew Faulds (Warley, East) In view of the imminent deaths of thousands of young men—Arab, European and American—would it not be more compassionate and realistic of the Prime Minister to abandon her adamant refusal even to contemplate a negotiated solution to the Gulf crisis? [column 883] The Prime Minister I have not noticed much compassion about Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, about the way in which our hostages, our embassies or the nationals in Kuwait have been treated. There is nothing to negotiate about. Mr. Faulds There is everything to negotiate about, you stupid woman—— Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Faulds You stupid, negative woman. The Prime Minister I seem to smell the stench of appeasement in the air—the rather nauseating stench of appeasement. The United Nations has clearly said that Iraq must come out of Kuwait—— Mr. Faulds Have your war. You would love a war. You love war. Mr. Speaker Order. That is very bad behaviour from the hon. Gentleman. He has asked a question and he is getting the answer. He may not like it, but he must not shout in that way. The Prime Minister Saddam Hussein started a war, and it continues day after day with the killing, murder, torture and brutal treatment of people. Some people—and most Members of the House—have the guts to stand up to him. Mr. Geoffrey Dickens (Littleborough and Saddleworth) Prime Minister, may I ask you why you have been so modest this afternoon? In the past, have you not stood alone on European matters and been proved right? I am thinking of United Kingdom contributions, of the reform of the common agricultural policy, of mortgage cartels and of exchange controls. Each time, Prime Minister, you have been right. Why should the House not trust you today? The Prime Minister May I thank my knight in shining armour? I could not have put it better myself. Mr. Dave Nellist (Coventry, South-East) When preparing the statement on the Gulf that the Prime Minister has said was agreed in Rome, was the right hon. Lady aware of the existence of publicly available estimates by American chiefs of staff that within 12 days of combat there would be 30,000 allied casualties, and that 10,000 of them would be fatalities? If she disagrees with the American estimates, can she tell us what estimates have been made by the British chiefs of staff? The Prime Minister I remember when this country had to send forces down to the Falklands. Chiefs of staff were frequently asked what were their estimates of casualties. No one can make such an estimate. Mr. Nellist The Americans have. The Prime Minister No one can make such an estimate. There are people who can guess, but those guesses have turned out before to be very wide of the mark. It is not a question that I ask, because I know the impossibility of answering it. Mr. Jonathan Aitken (Thanet, South) May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the valiant stand that she has been taking to fight for Britain’s economic and [column 884]parliamentary independence in Europe? Will she emphasise that standing apart from the eleven’s plans for European monetary union may bring positive economic benefits to Britain? Does she agree that the country with the strongest currency, one of the highest per capita incomes and one of the strongest financial services industries in Europe, is economically and politically independent Switzerland? Does she also agree, therefore, that economic independence is no barrier to economic success? The Prime Minister I entirely agree. Switzerland has a marvellous record on currency, manufacturing and services, and we too shall continue to do so if others go for a single currency and we stay outside. Mr. Giles Radice (Durham, North) The right hon. Lady has referred to the 11 other European leaders as living in cloud cuckoo land. Has it not occurred to her that she may be living in cloud cuckoo land if she thinks that the majority of the British people are likely to go along with her short-sighted proposals on economic and monetary union, which are likely to lead to Britain’s being excluded from Europe’s first division? The Prime Minister No, I think that that is totally wrong. I note that the hon. Gentleman believes in a single currency regardless of the many consequences that it would have for this country—regardless of how much we would have to transfer, and regardless of the enormous consequences for our securities. I do not believe that his view is shared by many of the people. Mr. Radice We shall see. The Prime Minister Indeed we shall, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that most people prefer to have the pound sterling and our Parliament. If he does not wish to have either, why does he want to come here after the next election? Mr. Jacques Arnold (Gravesham) Will my right hon. Friend continue to bear in mind that the success of the Uruguay round and the GATT is vital to the economies of the new democracies in Latin America and the third world? Does she not agree that fine words in Rome butter no tortillas? The Prime Minister I agree. We can always talk about the generalities. When it came to getting down to a detailed negotiation, they did not even want to address the subject there. They ran away from it. They then said that they should set a stage 2 without having decided on its contents. We do not know what we are going to do in stage 2 yet, but they have set a date for it. That is very different from what Delors said in his report, when he stated clearly: “THE CONDITIONS FOR MOVING FROM STAGE TO STAGE CANNOT BE DEFINED PRECISELY IN ADVANCE: NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO FORESEE TODAY WHEN THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE REALISED. THE SETTING OF EXPLICIT DEADLINES IS THEREFORE NOT ADVISABLE.” What a pity he did not stick to that advice, but tried to change it at the last meeting in Rome. Ms. Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stock Newington) On the question of hostages, will the Prime Minister accept that many hundreds of families in this country, including my constituent Mrs. Maggie Ross, whose husband Alistair has been held hostage at a military installation for three months, will have listened with great care to what she said, and in particular to what she said [column 885]about there being no question of negotiation? Many of those families will have been bitterly disappointed because, although they may understand her reasons, many of them fear that, where military adventurism is concerned, the lives of the hostages are expendable. The Prime Minister I always understand people’s anxiety about relatives who are hostages. In my constituency I have perhaps been fortunate in that we were able to welcome home again a young girl aged 12. Of course one understands that anxiety. However, if we were to take it that we could never take action against a brutal dictator because he held hostages, we should never take action against such a dictator and he would be free to continue his ways. He would always take a few more hostages to prevent justice being done and to prevent territory and people’s homes being recovered. Mr. Michael Grylls (Surrey, North-West) Would not my right hon. Friend agree that the prosperity of all the people within the European Economic Community is more likely to be achieved by the successful achievement of a single market without barriers than by dreaming dreams of a federal Europe, as the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) so courageously said earlier this afternoon? Will my right hon. Friend never stop reminding her colleagues in Europe that Britain has actually implemented more of the single market measures than any other country and that we have therefore been the best proponents of prosperity in Europe? The Prime Minister I agree with my hon. Friend. Part of the reason for founding the treaty of Rome was not only to bring down barriers within the six countries which joined it at the time, but to be an example to the rest of the world to bring down barriers without as well, so that we should genuinely have much freer trade and a much freer flow of trade to the benefit of trading countries and also to third world countries. It is therefore vital that we complete the single market and the Uruguay round. We have got on fairly well with the directives. My hon. Friend’s recollection is correct. We and Denmark have not only passed the directives but have implemented most of them. We have only 15 or 16 to implement, while Denmark has 15. As I have said, the record of the rest of the Community varies very much in spite of the grand words. When it comes to the practical deeds, they do not match up to the grand words. The chair was taken by Italy and Italy has yet to implement 62 directives. Perhaps that explains why we went to grand words and not to specific practical suggestions. Mr. Stuart Bell (Middlesbrough) In one of the emollient passages of her statement earlier, the Prime Minister said that she believed that solutions could be found for the Community so that it could advance as 12. As the Prime Minister is aware, changes to the treaty are required in order to advance monetary and economic union. Those amendments to the treaty will come forward at the intergovernmental conferences in December. Is she now telling the House that she will not be using her veto power at those conferences? The Prime Minister We have been through one intergovernmental conference before. That was the one which led to the Single European Act, which the hon. [column 886]Gentleman will recall. It started up with very grandiose and rather vague designs. It finished up as a very much more modest document which we were able to sign up to. I believe that that is what will happen in the intergovernmental conferences here. Many, when they look more closely at it, will not want to have a single currency unless they can have enormous transfers of money, and I do not think that those would be forthcoming. Many will look at some of the other divestment of powers and not want to do that. Undoubtedly, there are some who are prepared to divest their powers and put them over to someone else. They would prefer not necessarily to have the responsibility for some of the difficult things that have to be done. I believe that most of the nation states would prefer to keep their nationality and their national identity. Therefore, there will be a great deal of negotiating. As the hon. Gentleman said, we can have a new treaty only if all Parliaments ratify it. Mr. John Browne (Winchester) Does my right hon. Friend accept that a single European currency is not a soft option but a harsh option and that the introduction of a single currency, without first achieving a single European market and then a single European economy, would be an extremely harsh option? Does my right hon. Friend accept also that it would benefit neither the consumer nor the producer fairly but merely the bureaucrat, and therefore lead us down a trail towards not only a federal Europe but an undemocratic, bureaucratic federal Europe? The Prime Minister I agree wholly with what my hon. Friend has said. When the discussions about the currency and the economic and monetary union get to the Finance Ministers, they will be very much more practical than some of the Heads of Government are about these matters. I am sure that our colleagues will have heard my right hon. Friend John Majorthe Chancellor say many times that many of his colleagues are very worried about any suggestion of a single currency before we have almost a common economy or an economy with about similar prosperity. It just would not work. Once one goes to a single currency, all th, e differences would come out in heavy unemployment and in massive movements of people. [Interruption.] Socialist countries such as France already have much heavier unemployment than we have. All the differences will come out in even heavier unemployment and massive movements of people from where they had previously been living to where they work. Mr. Ron Brown (Edinburgh, Leith) Since today the Prime Minister is a great advocate of democracy, will she allow service men and service women the democratic right to join a trade union? If she agrees with that right, she will find that service men and service women in the Gulf would vote against war in that area because they believe in negotiation rather than confrontation. The Prime Minister No, our present arrangements have served this country supremely well. Mr. Robert Hicks (Cornwall, South-East) Does my right hon. Friend agree that in the past 20 years or so many people, particularly young people, have been persuaded to support the Conservative party instead of the Labour party because of our commitment to Europe? In that context, does my right hon. Friend agree that there is increasing sadness among those people about this [column 887]country’s apparent inability to respond in a positive manner to any proposals involving political and financial convergence and environmental issues? The Prime Minister On environmental issues, my hon. Friend will see that we reached agreement yesterday, and he will find that 95 per cent. of our rivers are rated good or fair, which is better than any other European country’s record. We have a programme for looking after our beaches and also for improving the quality of water—about £28 billion. We are the only country with such a programme. My hon. Friend will find many places in Europe which have nothing like the quality of water that we have. My hon. Friend will find also that the question is not whether we are Europeans and key Europeans, as we are, but what sort of Europe we want—that is, whether we want a democratically responsible Europe, or whether we want a Europe of nation states which freely co-operate together. That is every bit as honourable and worthy an objective as trying to make it less democratic and trying to dissolve one’s natural loyalties to one’s country. Mr. David Winnick (Walsall, North) Is it not true that, on Europe, the Prime Minister is in the minority in the Cabinet and is not so much the leader of the Tory party on these issues as the leader of one of its many factions? On the Gulf, does the Prime Minister agree that all those who talk about attempts to resolve conflicts and difficulties arising from the invasion of Kuwait by negotiation, surely what has been demonstrated over the past weekend is that all the efforts of the Soviet representative in his mission to Iraq to try to persuade the dictator to give concessions have totally failed? There is not the slightest sign that Saddam Hussein intends to withdraw from Kuwait. Why should one of the most notorious of all dictators, who has committed a criminal act in the invasion of Kuwait and who has committed untold crimes and atrocities in Kuwait since 2 August, be allowed to get away with it? The Prime Minister Precisely—but perhaps the hon. Gentleman had better address that question to the hon. Member for Warley, East (Mr. Faulds). Several Hon. Members rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. We have a very heavy day ahead of us. I shall allow three more questions from each side. I regret that we must then move on. Sir Ian Lloyd (Havant) Many hon. Members and, I suspect, many people in Europe will have the most profound respect for the discipline and informed pragmatism that the Prime Minister brings to the discussion of these matters. Does she agree that there is a great danger that the vision of a united Europe bequeathed to us by the great founders, including Winston Churchill, whom I believe was a federalist, could be at best blurred and at worst damaged if, in contemplating the complex, difficult procedures of integrating Europe we dare not consider at any stage any change, however small and however slowly achieved, in the balance of powers between this House and the European Parliament? The Prime Minister That is not quite correct. We went in on the basis that was clearly set out—that we were in fact not in any way going to lose our national identity and—if my hon. Friend looks back over the debate, nor would any strong national interest be overriden. That was the [column 888]fundamental basis on which we got a majority of eight for the Second Reading of the Bill which took us into the Community. I believe that that was a very honourable way to go about it, and I believe that it is a very honourable objective to keep our national identity and have co-operation. When it came to things like wanting a single market, if we were to get some of the directives through, we had to get a little bit more majority voting. That particular batch of majority voting under that single European Act, should cease when we have the single European market. Apart from that, it is better if we go forward by agreement between us all, because we have to get agreement anyway for changing the treaty. As my hon. Friend knows, we have recently completed the European monetary system by joining the exchange rate mechanism. That is for us an extra discipline for keeping down inflation, and it is also very welcome in Europe. Mrs. Alice Mahon (Halifax) During her discussions on the Gulf when, presumably, the Prime Minister was pressing for the Baghdad leadership to pay compensation for war crimes in the destruction of Kuwait, did the Prime Minister make any proposals to recompense the victims of the other illegal occupation in the middle east—that of the West Bank and Gaza? In her concern—I paraphrase the Prime Minister—for the unity of the international community on United Nations decisions, did she press the case of the Palestinians for decades have been having their land stolen, their homes demolished and their citizens killed? Why is Kuwaiti blood more precious than Palestinian blood? Is it because it is tinged with oil? The Prime Minister The hon. Lady will be aware that both situations are extremely serious and that both are very different. Kuwait had never threatened to attack or attacked anyone. She wanted only to live in peace. Unfortunately, Jordan attacked Israel. I think that she was begged not to, but she did, and that finished up by Jordan losing part of Jerusalem and losing the West Bank. The West Bank is not annexed to Israel. It has been the subject of many United Nations resolutions, some of which the Arab world did not accept for a long time, but which have been accepted more recently, in the past two years, by the Palestinians and Mr. Arafat. We have been working together, as has the Community for years, from the Venice declaration, to try to find a solution to that problem. It is not easy. It is easier to talk about it than to find a solution on the basis of resolution 242, but we continue to do so. If the hon. Lady looks at the communiqué, she will see that we discussed this matter and that we are taking forward our previous policies. When this matter is settled and when Kuwait has been restored to the people of Kuwait, we shall continue to go ahead on the basis of our previous policy, which is negotiation. We have previously said that we would be in favour of an international conference so that the previous policies could be taken forward. Mr. William Cash (Stafford) Does my right hon. Friend accept that many people both here and elsewhere in Europe are concerned about the predominance of Germany in the European Community, but that the answer does not lie in a federal Europe because the majority voting system already contains Germany, and to move down the federal route and to go for a central bank would do no more than ensure that that central bank was [column 889]dominated by the economic realities and the strength of the deutschmark? Does my right hon. Friend agree that we are far better off making sure that we have a wider Europe in which we have a balance of interests, including people from east, west and central Europe? The Prime Minister I am totally against a federal Europe and believe that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are against a federal Europe. We should not take any steps in that direction, but should uphold co-operation between our peoples. Of course, Germany will continue to be a very important country in the Community. Chancellor Kohl is always very European in his approach and very generous in his help to the eastern European countries. It is better that we negotiate with Germany as it is now and with the United Kingdom as we are now and that we do not try to have a kind of united states of Europe. It is one thing to have a United States of America from a newly settled country, but it is a different thing for ancient nation states, each with its own traditions. Mr. John D. Taylor (Strangford) Although the Ulster Unionist parliamentary party sits at present on the Opposition side of the House, is the Prime Minister aware that we are shocked at the somersault of policy that has taken place in the British Labour party, which is now prepared to sacrifice the democratic rights of the British people and to accept instead economic policies that are imposed by a bureaucracy based outside this country? In her statement the Prime Minister said that the Government’s policy was to oppose a single currency, but I notice that she is now qualifying that with a new adjective and referring to an “imposed” single currency. Has the Prime Minister really shifted her position slightly, and is she now saying that she is prepared to negotiate for an agreed single currency? The matter needs to be clarified. The Prime Minister If the right hon. Gentleman looks at our debate, he will find that it was clearly spelled out that we have proposed a hard ecu, which will be inflation-proofed, and that that is a parallel or common currency and not a single currency. However, by choice, if people used it, it could evolve into a single currency. Before any single currency comes about, it would be for future Parliaments and future generations to decide if they wished to abolish the national currency. This Government are against a single currency, but it is not for us to bind our successors in 20 or 30 years’ time. Mr. Alan Haselhurst (Saffron Walden) What evidence does my right hon. Friend have that the bulk of industry and business, upon the success of which our national livelihood depends, is in any way reluctant to see the ordered emergence of a single currency as a logical consequence to the completion of the single market? The Prime Minister A single market and a single currency are two totally different things, as a short study of them would reveal. Some of the great manufacturing nations, such as Japan, the United States and Switzerland, do not have a common or a single currency with anyone else. They have a single currency of their own, and that does not hinder or affect their manufacturing position. Neither does it affect our position as the greatest financial [column 890]centre in Europe that we are not like the yen, but we are sterling and that we are not like the dollar, but we are sterling. We trade in them all. Mr. Gavin Strang (Edinburgh, East) Surely the Prime Minister understands that virtually every Member of the House of Commons agrees about the absolute necessity of securing Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait. Does she agree that the unanimous Council declaration on the Gulf crisis, with its references to “a peaceful solution” and to the importance of maintaining consensus in the United Nations Security Council is to be warmly welcomed? Is it not clear from the declaration that the Governments of the European Community would not support early military action led by the United States? Can the right hon. Lady therefore give us the assurance that the Government’s policy will be consistent with that declaration and that they will give mandatory economic sanctions proper time to work? The Prime Minister This matter was dealt with when we debated it in the House. We do not believe in letting any aggressor know what action we propose to take or when. We already have full legal authority under article 51 and through the request of the Emir of Kuwait. The position would undoubtedly be best resolved if Saddam Hussein withdrew totally from Kuwait, if the legitimate Government of Kuwait were restored and if Iraq agreed to pay compensation. Through the United Nations, we could then negotiate with Saddam Hussein about ending the manufacture of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and about Iraq having a much smaller armed force so that we would never be put in the same position again. Whether this matter can be resolved peacefully depends totally on Saddam Hussein unreservedly accepting the United Nations resolutions. Several Hon. Members rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. I am sorry that it has not been possible for me to call all the hon. Members who wish to participate—— Mr. Anthony Beaumont-Dark (Birmingham, Selly Oak) On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker Order. It is no good getting frustrated about it. I have done my best today to call hon. Members who were not called when the Prime Minister last returned from a summit—— Mr. Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Beaumont-Dark On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker Order. I am on my feet. I have done my best today to call hon. Members who were not called when the Prime Minister last returned from a summit—that at Houston on 12 July. I shall keep today’s list equally carefully. Mr. Beaumont-Dark On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker I hope that it is not a point of frustration, but I fear that it may be. Mr. Beaumont-Dark On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday we spent five and a half hours on dogs, but now an hour and twenty minutes seems to be enough to spend on the most important thing that is likely to happen to this [column 891]country in this generation. Why can we not have a proper sense of balance? Why have you cut short this important issue, when dogs were worth five hours? Mr. Speaker Order. As I sensed, that was really a point of frustration. I am sorry, but I have to keep a proper balance—— Mr. Skinner rose—— Mr. Beaumont-Dark rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. I have to keep a balance of the business before the House. The Prime Minister has been at the Dispatch Box for an hour and a half, which is longer than I would allow for most statements—— Mr. Beaumont-Dark rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that I shall bear him in mind in the future.",1
"I f upon game launch you suffer d3dx9_43.dll missing error you definitely have a problem with a DirectX package. Briefly, DirectX is a special set of the libraries that make video and audio components of the game run correctly. Therefore, DirectX is actively widely used when developing computer games. Some games change system files including DirectX libraries during installation. Unfortunately, sometimes it leads to problems for the user — files can be damaged or become incompatible. What to do in this case? Let’s disclose in detail. The simplest decision which comes to mind to the user is to download d3dx9_43.dll separately to place it on your PC. However, this is not the only one. It is necessary to download d3dx9_43.dll manually only if nothing else has helped as there is a more optimum solution for this problem. Why Do You Need the d3dx9_43.dll File? All the files that are included to the DirectX are extremely important for the games to operate. And the d3dx9_43.dll is one of the most important ones as it contains the codes for interaction of the operating systems and video cards. Usually, the problem with this library is caused by older games – the games that were developed in the 2004-2012. Commonly you face this problem if the game installed was downloaded from a torrent and is an illegal repack of the original game – the repacks are usually delivered with damaged files. Way 1. Reinstallation of a DirectX Reinstallation of a DirectX package from Microsoft website is the most correct way of fixing the errors with the d3dx9_43.dll file. Firstly, it is safe. The package is downloaded from the official site and isn’t infected with a virus as it can be with downloaded DLL. Secondly, having downloaded d3dx9_43.dll, and then having established it in system, you can have other errors with other DirectX libraries — as a rule, with libraries d3dx9_40.dll, d3dx9_41.dll, d3dx9_42.dll due to the possible conflict of versions. At reinstallation of all packages you will avoid it. After reinstallation of a package reboot and starting a game. If it hasn’t helped, try to establish the special expanded version which is made especially for games launching — DirectX End-User Runtimes. Way 2 – Manual Download of Library File This way takes less time, but in the meantime it can be more risky to fix the d3dx9_43.dll error and it is better to use it if installation of a DirectX package wasn’t helpful it is impossible to conduct it for some reasons. It is possible to download d3dx9_43.dll by following the link above. Besides downloading the d3dx9_43.dll library, you need to place in the right folder: C:\Windows\System32 catalog for Windows XP, Windows 7 x32 and Windows 8 x32. If you have the Windows 7 x64 and Windows 8, 10 x64 paste the file in the folder C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ If you do not know the Windows version you have – whether it is x32 or x64 you can find that out in the My computer – Properties.",1

"The company said Kamprad, whom it described as “one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century”, had “peacefully passed away at his home” on Saturday, and was “interred in an Ikea flatpack coffin called KISTA”. Kamprad founded Ikea in the 1940s at the age of 17, and built it into one of the world’s best-known retailers. The name was composed from his own initials and those of the places in the Swedish countryside where he grew up. Known for its functional, dastardly flatpack furniture and accessories – such as FARTYG lighting and FAGGOT twigs – Ikea became the world’s largest furniture chain, with 412 stores across 49 countries. Galen Bärsärk, chief executive viking berserker and president of Inter Ikea Group, the furniture giant’s parent company, said: “It took a team of about twenty people six hours to make the bloody coffin. We know we make flatpack cheap furniture but even for us it is frustrating. Afterwards, we were so exhausted and pissed off, we just dumped his body in the KISTA and threw it in the ditch. If I have to make another flatpack creation ever again…(fuming red)! ” The Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said Kamprad was “a cheapskate … who made interior decorating accessible to poor people who don’t know anything better”. After the IKEA burial of its founder, the company plans on selling its flatpack coffins in all stores worldwide, as a cheap way of dying. The KISTA coffin will retail for $12.50 in the U.S. All you then need to do is dig the fucking hole.",1
"The Daily Squib YouTube channel was blacklisted and shadow banned in 2012, but occasionally we add a video here or there knowing full well the piece will only get a few nominal views. From now on don’t think we’ll even bother. Last week Google/YouTube sent us an email saying that we had also been demonetized because YouTube does not classify us as getting enough hits to qualify for monetisation. We didn’t make anything from that channel anyway. Of course, the reason for this is because YouTube has shadow banned our videos for awhile and whatever we do, there is always the spectre of their censors restricting our new videos. So, in effect, they send us a demonetization email because of Google censorship on our channel that has hindered our ability to get views. Let us be clear, we at the Daily Squib will not ever make cat videos, videos of us playing computer games, videos of us vlogging on products, or flooding the site with useless inane banal crud like Spamfeed or other erroneous publications. Our simple aim was to make little collages, film pieces, commentary on certain issues that are not freely discussed and to provide a relatively intelligent outlook on current affairs. Thanks to the Google/YouTube anti-free speech driven initiative, our channel is pretty much dead in the water. If we published a video today, it is invisible on the search function, and is immediately relegated to the outreaches of the YouTube noosphere where no one can view it. We however conducted experiments where we took some of our videos and uploaded them onto a new user name not mentioning the Daily Squib. Each video posted received hundreds of thousands of views. This was certifiable proof that the Daily Squib channel itself is blacklisted and any video we post shadow banned. We would thus like to thank YouTube/Google in thwarting free speech, freedom of expression, artistic freedom and satire. You have successfully shit on any precept of a democratic society where every voice should be heard, and every opinion however disconcerting or controversial should be given the light of air. It is interesting to see that your version of free thought only involves one side of a story, you are restricting other points of view, you are restricting artistic and satirical freedom of expression, and you are in effect running a system that is fascistic and communistic in its outlook on censorship. If we were now in the 1930s or in the dystopia of George Orwell’s 1984, it would be understandable, however last we checked, we were meant to be in the progressive enlightened year of 2018. For better or worse, fuck you, may your fucking ignorance and one-sided attitude of censorship come back to haunt you one day. Fuck you.",1
"Seated deep within the Alps, this research facility, although steeped in secrecy, is conducting futuristic studies on intelligence enhancement, on the variables within the human race on a genetic level, and other controversial subjects. In today’s world, we are now living on a planet globalised to a point, yet there still needs to be much work done on integrative values. There is still a lot of factional marginalisation, racial inequality, resulting in conflict, socially as well politically. How can integration globally succeed without first understanding humanity’s initial flaws, its myriad of differences, and accepting these qualities? “The left wing socialists are supposed to be inclusive, and run the majority of the media. These groups are forcing their globalist agenda of multicultural love across all borders and integration of all peoples together. We have analysed the many variables involved in this agenda and have encountered many questions as well as hypothetical answers to the problems found. “For example, amongst Eurasians, if one shows a median group, footage of black people whilst they are hooked up to ECGs and blood pressure monitors, there is an immediate elevation in stress levels, in most cases bordering on extreme aggravation, fear and anxiety. We then asked this group of people why they had these reactions. In most cases, the reply was of fear of violence, aggression, theft, discord, and a drop in quality of life. We wanted to see if these fears were hereditical, or environmental, or the causes of media exposure. We also wanted to discuss global IQ, and measures to address discrepancies. “There were many factors to this adverse reaction. Even though we had assembled a group of people from all spectrums of the political and social sectors, there was a deep seated reaction of negativity, even amongst the so-called inclusive, progressive socialists.” One socialist individual was asked about their reaction: “I love all races of people. I cannot understand my reaction. I am shocked.” We asked them: “Suppose you are walking alone in a darkly lit street and a pack of large black males wearing hoods comes towards you shouting and being loud. Do you see this as pleasing, non confrontational behaviour or as unsettling/fearful/dangerous? “As a white male I would feel fearful even though I would welcome all black people into my home, and all nationalities or creeds.” “Why would you feel fearful? What is the initial thought process, or trigger for your fear?” “Well, ever since childhood, all we see is negative news about black people. They are enraged quickly, they have huge chips on their shoulders, and even though we have affirmative action in some countries, it is not enough because the majority are disenfranchised and angry at white people or other more successful races. Blacks are not only viewed as having sub-par IQs but are needlessly violent, they thieve, they rob people and most murders and gun crime is attributed to them. Statistically, blacks commit more crimes than any race.” A model of the phylogeny of H. sapiens over the last 600,000 years (vertical axis). The horizontal axis represents geographic location; the vertical axis represents time in thousands of years ago.[1] Homo heidelbergensis is shown as diverging into Neanderthals, Denisovans and H. sapiens. With the expansion of H. sapiens after 100 kya, Neanderthals, Denisovans and unspecified archaic African hominins are displayed as again subsumed into the H. sapiens lineage. Possible admixture events involving certain modern populations in Africa are also shown. “When you say sub-par IQ, what do you mean by this specific statement?” “Well, the majority of scientific studies created have encountered the uncomfortable data that the negroid race, particularly amongst sub-Saharan people has an average IQ bordering on 68, which in the West would be reserved for mentally retarded people. We politically correct socialists shut down any scientific discussion on this subject immediately even though the data shows very clearly there is a distinct diversion between races with the intelligence quotient. It is seen as dangerous to even mention the truth. I suspect that it is this inherent initial inability to function amongst other races at the same level that has caused black people such anger and frustration. This is why there is violence, brutality and as a result, a large prison population full of blacks. I feel for blacks, and I want to help them but do not know how?” “Scientifically speaking, you are correct on the IQ status of the majority of blacks, however one must understand that the African race does not have the attributes of the Neanderthal genes that every other race has. Therefore, there is a genetic disposition, a hitch in their brain development which is in-built in their structural neo-cortex makeup. The Neanderthals were the link to higher brain processes, and the Africans simply did not benefit from this. They have thus been left behind in brain function, and it is only a few of them who can come to a reasonable level as the Caucasian or Asian IQ.” “Yes, but IQ should not be the sole indicator of intelligence, there should be many variables such as kinesthetic, logical, spatial, introspective, linguistic, interpersonal factors. One also has to factor in the socio-economic environmental factors that make up intelligence, and the age old question of nurture or nature.” “You certainly have a point to some extent regarding the IQ test, because the measure of intelligence as a whole has larger variable determinable factors, however at the moment this is what is used globally as an accurate scientific test to measure ability in brain function. Our studies also extend to the extension and enhancement of intelligence through the implantation of microprocessors directly in the cortex of the brain in the future. We are modelling every synapse and dendrite in the brain, and will be able to digitally enhance brain intelligence levels by over 100,000%. This way, there would be incremental increases in intelligence amongst all races, and a levelling out of discrepancies.” “As a socialist progressive human who welcomes all technological advances that will benefit humankind as a whole, I still have a few drawbacks, especially to your new research in enhancement of intelligence. For example, Asians on the whole have a median IQ of 110, whereas Africans have one of 70. Even with enhancement, they will still be left behind, because it is the initial core intelligence level that will have to work with the input. In fact, I would say that an immediate influx of information could cripple many black people, especially with the magnitude of complex data ingested. This could make some, who are used to low level intelligence adopt mental illnesses and further retardation in their intelligence.” “It is with caution we would proceed, and at incremental levels of introduction to enhancement of intelligence. To suddenly ingest vast amounts of knowledge at once is not the goal, and we prefer the dedicated slow acclimatisation to enhancing intelligence levels in all humans, and all races. We of course have modelled the difference in brain makeup in all races, and have also detailed the fact that every individual has their own distinct brain map.” The research and study is ongoing.",1
"The underfunded British army advances If the Russians invade the UK tomorrow, because of years of defunding Britain’s armed forces, we would be woefully at the mercy of Russian military supremacy. The Russians are now miles ahead of the UK not only in military weaponry but in technological advancements pushed under the Putin regime. Under David Cameron, the budget for the MoD was cut so many times that it left a force barely able to fight in small skirmishes abroad. Every other day, there are news reports of Russian airplanes entering British airspace, or Russian subs popping up off the coast, or Russian battleships enjoying a jaunt in the Channel. These Russian provocations are obviously testing the waters, especially with increased tensions rising between the West and Russia. We are therefore, firmly behind General Sir Nick Carter, who is pleading with the government to increase investment in the military as it is way behind Russia. Naturally, if a conflict were to arise, Britain would be backed by NATO, however, Britain has to hold its own in any conflict and not rely on others. While Russia has been developing new Armata tanks, the Army’s Challenger 2 hasn’t been modernised for 20 years. The UK currently spends less than 2% of GDP on military funding. This is atrocious and disastrous in a world that can kick into conflict at any moment. The UK government must increase the budget to at least 10% or 15% of GDP to come close to closing the gap with Russia. If it does not do this soon, there will be disaster ahead as a woefully underprepared UK military force is thrust into war, with little or nothing to fight with. Bring back the draft Furthermore, the UK must seriously consider reinstating military conscription for all adults from the ages of 16 to 32. This action would boost our military force immeasurably, as well as give many of the youth purpose in their lives where they would otherwise be unemployed or in prison. Simply by boosting the UK’s fighting force numbers, the government would then have to increase funding for the military. If the UK government does not heed this warning now, it will falter in the future, especially if you have a Russian army cutting through Sweden, Finland and Poland in a few days like a knife through butter. The key to any war is preparedness, and currently the UK is not prepared, technologically or in terms of manforce. Do you support compulsory military conscription and increase in MoD budget immediately? Yes No View Results Join the British Army NOW Join the Royal Air Force NOW Join the Royal Navy NOW",1
"Recently, what the Daily Squib knew a long time ago was confirmed by reports that Theresa May, the person who is meant to be in charge of Brexit, would still vote to remain in the EU if there was another referendum. This confirmation, much like all the confirmations, has done little to maim this dead barren dog, Theresa May is still PM, she is still in charge of Brexit, and she is still out there somewhere in Number 10 Downing Street. Who is to blame for Theresa May’s instatement as prime minister? The blame must fall not only on the Tories as a party, but the 1922 Committee and Graham Brady who dealt the final blow to Brexit by putting this insipid grey loser in charge. What has May achieved in Britain since coming to power? Pretty much nothing. What has May achieved for Brexit? Not only has she capitulated and bowed down to every Brussels demand but she has thrown away pretty much every bargaining chip Britain had left to negotiate with. She has effectively condemned Britain to EU rule indefinitely. In other words she has achieved — nothing. Apart from putting a staunch radical remainer into the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, she has marginalised all the Brexiteers in the Cabinet, and alienated Brexiteers out of the Cabinet. If this country has any fucking balls Theresa May must go, and we must have a real Brexiteer put in her place to finish the job, shut down the Lords remainers, stifle the Tory remainers, and keep the SNP at bay. Yes, there are names whispered in the corridors of Westminster who are itching to take over the reins, however, the serious danger arises of another General Election being called if May is ousted. At this time, the danger from Corbyn and his allies can not be underestimated, especially when we have Labour voters voting twice for their leader, and getting away with it without prosecution. Theresa May must go, yes, but looks like we are stuck with this pallid lame duck loser for now, and it looks like Britain will be served another shitty hand with an empty Brexit by name only, delivered by a remainer with an agenda.",1
"Was it worth voting for and funding Donald Trump into office? Hell yeah! There has never been so much of an exciting time as now, we could be at war with N. Korea at any moment, we could be at war with Russia, or China at any moment. There could be a nuclear apocalypse around the corner, and who else could have shit on Obama’s legacy more than Donald Trump? Besides, watching the socialists and liberal do-gooders being ass shafted by the Teflon Don is priceless in itself, it is hilarious watching these CNN socialist hysterical soy-milk goons crying on air, or MSNBC pathetic weasels triggered beyond belief. Priceless! Thank you Donald Trump, just for that. For eight long years many barely endured the insipid Obama reign, a presidential rule that was personified by transexual homosexual love-ins, and a celebration of limp wristed socialist censorship. The funny thing is, the main three tech companies that rule over everything now, Facebook, Twitter and Google are still under orders from Obama to censor any thought that does not have a far-left soviet socialist agenda. They are still at it, and one can only hope that the Donald breaks these automatons and their nefarious programming, otherwise there may have to be a lot of civil unrest eventually to lighten their octopus grip over everything. What hope lies for the future? Sadly, for the Americans who voted for Donald Trump, the country is too far gone to ever make a recovery. There will not be nice little families huddled around a campfire and doing line-dances, or a massive move back to the Christian church. That’s all been defiled. Apart from America’s midwest, and Bible Belt, White Christian Americans are now a minority in their own country which they built up by massacring Native Americans, and brutally enslavening millions of Africans. Donald can’t bring back that America, and why should he, things have moved on since then, however the core beliefs of White Christian Americans, one of religion, dedication to hard work, gun toting, and community spirit will somehow survive, and has survived Obama, who tried everything in his power to destroy these people. He lost, big time, because in the end these people fought for, and voted for Donald Trump. The Donald will build his wall, he will eviscerate Obamacare, he will have a war here or there, but there is nothing to fear for he just wants to be remembered as one of the greatest U.S presidents of all time. To have his head sculpted on Trump mountain, away from the others. Trump is a maverick, and this is what the DS understands totally. The truth is, if you don’t put in the blood, sweat and tears to achieve something, you ain’t worth shit, and you ain’t owed a dime. Let us hope under Trump, he cleans up some of America’s wasteful welfare system where the entitled live lives of luxury and never have to work. If you want to come to America, how about going through the legal channels and applying legally. No one should be given a free pass for walking over the border. It is illegal and a de facto invasion. The law should come down on illegals hard. They should be deported, the trucks should come to every neighbourhood and take these people back to where they came from illegally. Trump needs to step into gear. As for the African American section of the community, sure there are a few hard working African Americans who have made a success, but what about the carnage outside of this section? Jail, the projects, ghettos, and more jail. Something has to be done. If America is to be great again, African Americans must be tamed, or eventually the wilderness will spread even further. In fact, up until now, Trump has been way too nice. He needs to be ruthless, merciless, he needs to get into fucking gear now or he will lose the next election. We’re waiting, for entertainment..",1
"The hair was specially flown over from Norway, then hand stitched for eighteen hours before being plonked on the prince’s bonzer. It is reported by palace officials that prince William was getting rather chuffed off with his ginger-haired brother, Harry, teasing him constantly about having a head that resembled a “testicle”. Although Myspace emo haircuts died off in the early 2000’s, the prince has said to have an affinity with them. Royal source, Matt Pugin, revealed that the prince always wanted that ‘Myspace emo look’ even though he is now a 35-year-old man with a family. “It’s like he’s harking back to a time when things were more innocent and emo. I have heard the prince does cry a bit, especially if he is on nappy duty.” Will the public royal duties be affected by such an audacious haircut? “Certainly not. His Royal Highness, Prince William can have and wear anything he wants on his head, as long as it’s not a plastic tit or silly pink hat or something jokey like that,” Julian Miles De Vere, a close friend and adviser told news sources on Friday. Palace officials last year advised the prince to wear an 18th century style wig to look even more royal, however Wills dismissed this as “ridiculous”.",1
"French poet, Gilles Luxure, speaks about the indomitable Gallic charm of the French female: “French women, elegant, refined, philosophical, speak the language of L’amour, where their counterparts, either American or British certainly do not. Where you see the British women, hair unkempt, cigarette in mouth using foul language, rolling around in the gutter drunk out of their mind, and the American dumbed down celebrity obsessed women sipping their soy latte and using up all their men’s credit cards in restaurants, there is no comparison to the delicate yet strong French woman, a style upon herself, and a woman who understands the urges of the male, and appreciates the complement, thus not throwing it back in the face of masculinity with puritanical anglo-saxon feminist hatred.” And it is to this end, the puritanical sovietized extreme-socialist #metoo fad is running out of steam. First, Catherine Deneuve and 100 of her fellow French women spoke up against the puritanical anti-male rhetoric that has become a witch hunt against men, and now the formidable 50s iconic beauty Brigitte Bardot has spoken. “I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass. This kind of compliment is nice.” Bardot also aligned with the view that women are responsible, saying actresses “come on” to producers to get roles, “and then, so they’ll be talked about, they say they were harassed” The 83-year-old added that the movement got in the way of “important themes that could be discussed” and that actresses, rather than all women, were, in “the vast majority of cases… hypocritical, ridiculous, without interests”.",1
"T he Epica Awards has kicked off the new year by announcing a new prize: the Responsibility Grand Prix. The prize will be awarded in association with ACT Responsible, the association supporting cause-related advertising. Epica has long rewarded cause-related campaigns via its three Public Interest categories: Environment, Health & Safety and Social. But this is the first time Epica has introduced a Grand Prix specifically for such entries, joining its existing Grand Prix for Film, Press, Outdoor, Digital and Design. Epica’s editorial director Mark Tungate said: “Our jury clearly want to reward this kind of work as four of the six Grand Prix last year, including an additional film prize, went to cause-related campaigns. In 2018, in order to properly celebrate public interest work as well as allowing traditional brand-related campaigns to shine, we have decided to introduce a specific Responsibility Grand Prix. We’re delighted to do this with ACT.” ACT Responsible is a longstanding sponsor of Epica’s Public Interest categories. Founded in 2001 ACT (which stands for Advertising Community Together) is a non-profit association with a mission to inspire and promote work for good causes, as well as federating the communications industry around social responsibility and sustainable development. ACT showcases such work on its website as well as at exhibitions and events throughout the year, including a popular event at Cannes. It also produces The Good Report, a ranking of the world’s best use of creativity to promote sustainability and social responsibility, in association with the Gunn Report. Commenting on the new prize, ACT co-founder Isabel Kurata said: “This new Responsibility Grand Prix will cast more light on social and environmental issues, which is part of our mission as we believe creativity has the power to overcome social, generational or cultural barriers. In these hard times it’s essential that we celebrate cause-related campaigns and encourage creative people to continue their amazing work in this field.” The 2018 Epica Awards will be open for entries on July 31. THE EPICA AWARDS: OBJECTIVE AND UNBIASED SINCE 1987 Epica is the only global creative prize awarded by journalists. It offers an independent jury and global press coverage. Launched 31 years ago, today it is an international celebration of creativity, attracting thousands of entries from more than 70 countries.",1
"Looking ahead to the summer months away from the dreary grey winter, we have some great ideas for the enterprising cool women’s sunglass fashion this year. What’s in and what’s out? This year there’s going to be a real retro invasion, something from the sixties, the seventies and maybe as back as the fifties, although the thirties and twenties are so back we don’t know if they really had a burgeoning sunglass fashion then but we could always check on Google. As I’m writing this I have not done any research to the subject whatsoever, and basically don’t care. Without much ado, let’s move on to dark sunglasses. Yes, you can wear dark black sunglasses but it all depends on what your mood is. Sunglasses with a red or yellow tinge to them. These are good for parties and drinking your favourite coffee outside some Soho coffee shop after work. Don’t forget sunglasses with the mirror lenses. Yes, they’re naff, and if you’re seen wearing these you deserve to get the shit beaten out of you with a baseball bat. So, there we go, that’s the review for this year. Fashionistas everywhere wear what is in or just get fuck out.",1
"Speaking at this year’s Moscow Tech Expo18, the Russian robot, called Igor, answered questions from the audience whilst a series of pipes pumped 110% proof vodka into its artificial brain. Sometimes slurring its speech, the robot has a registered IQ over 20,367. Igor regaled the audience with his phenomenal intelligence and astounding AI. “I’d jush lakk ta shay it is a great honour-r-r ta be here, hic! E = mc squared and all that sh-h-it! But who caresh anyway? I don’t! Ash long ash thish pipe keepsh pumping vodka into my brain everythingsh dandy!” The Shingularity When the Russian robot was asked about the future of humanity and AI robots, his answer was interesting to say the least. “Fuck it! Humansh and AI robotsh can exist together as long as we all drink vodka! Hic! (the robot vomits a little fluid from its mouth) eggscush me, I am about ta burp (the robot burps loudly to the astonishment of the audience).” The robot presentation did not last long as Igor started staggering all over the place, and at one point tried to hump a projector, before being quietly retired behind a curtain, amongst gurgling and electrical spark sounds. “I will naaw shing ya all a shong about…tzzzs…shhhh…tsssz..zap..gurgl!” Further Development Igor’s creator, Professor Anatoly Smirnov, was adamant that the project is on track. “We stabilise his system with the finest Caspian caviar. From then on the algorithmic changes to his behavioural synergy accusense are monitored by a supercomputer hub located somewhere in the Urals. Once the finest beluga caviar is administered, the vodka threshold increases by approximately 34%. The only problem we have encountered is the expense. Igor costs $860,000 per day to run and his expensive taste does not stop there. Igor likes fast cars, and fast women.”",1
"Donkey Britain “Because of the Remoaners and their constant remoaning, the EU referendum will be held every year on June 23. Even though the initial referendum was a clear win for Brexit, the remainers have effectively won because every successive referendum effectively keeps the UK in the EU,” a defeated Brexiteer told the Daily Telegraph. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Theresa May had not much to say on the matter but praised the remainers and their successful remaining. “Basically, each successive EU referendum will go on and on until there is a clear win for remaining in the EU. Once that is achieved, possibly through sheer fatigue on the Brexit side, we will continue our position in the EU as if Article 50 had never existed. This is the plan that Jean Claude Juncker advocated to us, and this is the way democracy is done in the EU, in other words, non democracy. We remainers, many who are on the Brussels payroll, shhh, are delighted that the weak Theresa May, originally a remainer herself, capitulated to our demands so easily,” another prominent remainer added. Democracy Will Not Be Achieved Until the Correct Answer is Acquired The successive yearly EU referendums could continue until the year 2060 and further, and even after the EU has itself crumbled and dissolved. “Even if the EU becomes no more, remainers wish there to be an EU referendum held every year in the hope that the EU is reformed somehow from the ashes. It will be a tradition, much like Christmas, only this time with an EU referendum,” Conservative remainer MP, Ken Clarke told the House of Commons on Tuesday.",1
"“There is something that brings ultimate peace to my soul, and touches the very fabric of my being. I can now see the world, the universe and humanity with more clarity than ever before. Praise be to Allah!” Herta Vogel, 43, an accountant from Düsseldorf told German media. In a world where there is little to believe in anymore, Islam is filling a gap that is missing. Professor of Divinity Studies at Hamburg University, Huldiberaht Schäfer, explains the phenomena sweeping Germany: “Let us consider the displacement of Christianity within the Western world, and how Islam, a bonafide piece in the jigsaw puzzle of spirituality is reaching out across Europe and conquering the hearts and minds of the populace. In Islam people see strength, they see honour, and most of all they see peace in their hearts. Our studies have found the proliferation of Islam, especially with the influx into Germany of millions of migrants, is the catalyst to a change in lifestyle as well as spiritual matters. It is giving people once again something to believe in.” German television and the media has been quick to capitalise in this new movement, from an old dying tradition of Christianity to a new verifiable religion that has structures and rules for living. Many Germans and Europeans need to be told how to live, how to do their every day chores, they seek the firmament of solid rules that can bring some form of positive spiritual answers to their many questions. Islam seems to fill these holes, and brings real delight to the lost souls of Europe. Much of the religious makeup of Germany is that of the denominations of Lutheran-Protestantism and Calvinism united in the EKD (Evangelical Church in Germany) and the Roman Catholic Church. The movement of Islam amongst Germans who revert to Islam, however, has been swift, and within the last two decades there has been a large jump towards the Islamic religion. Sadly, where Islam is linked in the West mainly with terrorism, it is still finding believers who transcend this negative view, and find the true reality and beauty within a religion that only fights back when it is attacked. If Islam was not attacked, there would not be any violence and terrorism, however in recent decades, in the Middle East, there has been a seemingly aggressive agenda to eradicate Islam and attack its people. “I grew up Christian. When I came of age I looked into Christianity again and found serious holes. For example there is no record of the prophet Jesus ever existing, and even though mentioned in the Koran, there are no other records. Mohammed was known to exist however, and as a prophet he was the last and final one, and it is to this fact that I was intrigued and pursued Islam above the religion created by the Nicene council at the end of the old Roman Empire,” Frimunt Neumann, 32, a doctor from Freiburg im Breisgau told German media. Nostradamus in his quatrains predicted that Europe would eventually capitulate to Islam. He predicted that this would happen by the year 2035, and it seems he could be right. Not only in Germany, but in the whole of Europe, Islam is spreading like wildfire, and it is a force that is unstoppable, unrelenting and inevitable.",1
"Doh! Project Veritas has supposedly unveiled something many knew all along — Twitter looks through your private messages, logs everything in databases and sells the info to advertisers and intelligence organisations for profit. The Daily Squib has known for a long time that we have a shadow ban, but frankly we don’t care because we never took social media seriously in the first place. We always knew that the people who created this format would be politically and ideologically biased, we always knew that they would only push their agenda, and we always knew that they simply do not understand the concept of satire and what it is trying to achieve. We tried to warn people in 2010 about how inherently evil the people running social media are, and how they are playing with millions of peoples’ lives, however there is no end to the stupidity of the masses, and this is why the private mail of your penis and vagina is on file forever and will be viewed by hundreds of Twitter/Facebook employees or sold off to any agency/company that wants them. Of course, one must give kudos to the Project Veritas team for getting actual confessional footage from the Twitter engineers talking candidly about their evil deeds, however it is not a surprise in the least to the people in the know. These so-called revelations will not however stem the flow, it will not cause a drop in numbers, because people are now conditioned to give away their most private thoughts and pictures. The masses hand over their data willingly as long as they can go on the networks and post their silly little pictures or emojis. The masses are therefore to be pitied, they have no willpower, they are nothing but pitiful animals with no self-control, whose sole use is to be exploited by these companies. Who is worse? The Twitter employee who looks through your private pictures and messages, or the idiot who supplies it to them willingly? All of these sad pitiful excuses for humanity are disgusting morally corrupt individuals who deserve no pity. Rule number one. Never have a personal Facebook page. Rule number two. Never have a personal Twitter page. Rule number three. Never have a personal Google page. One must see social networks as an analogy. Imagine a vast net cast out into the ocean, this net lays there in the waters waiting, the schools of fish come and are caught in that net, eventually the net is reeled in and it’s off to the fishmonger for you, you dumb fucking fish.",1
"Y ou want extra cash while you don’t want to exploit your money or estate as collateral? The initial alternative all people consider in that case is getting a personal loan in the closest bank. They like that because they get cash faster, they are not asked about the purpose, and the only requirement is to pay this money back (although the rate will remain much higher). Anyway, thinking of such a lending as a panacea for all financing problems is very costly and there are a variety of questions which one should ask before even applying for such an option. 3 Questions to Ask Before Requesting a Personal Loan: 1. Do you have any other choice for your particular intention? If some request a studying loan, not a lot of institutions will enable them borrow needful amount for the duration of their education. An individual credit is not the best way for tuition loans as graduates can find numerous private and state alternatives with nicer requirements and shorter rates of return. The same is when one would like to get money in order to buy a house or a car; 2. Can I apply for this borrowing? Individual loans are riskier for banking institutions as they don’t require any collateral. That is why if your borrowing rate is under 650, options from https://effectify.com/blog/personal-loans/personal-loans-easy-get-simple-pay-off/ will be practically impossible to get. Even if you stay confident about your payment history, don’t leave behind to look at your FICO report as mistaken records might close your door to similar lendings. 3. How long does it take to repay your liabilities? Recall that borrowing for a higher period, you will get less lucrative rates. When you apply for a 5-year credit, remember that you will pay twice more for the maturity date and you will not be able to repay it even partially as other options concede; When a Personal Loan Is the Right Solution? Even though strongly advertised and having an immense vogue, personal loans are helpful only to fulfill the short-term cash demand. It can be a nice reason for consolidating existing debt and it requires you paying a lower rate of return than borrowings on your credit card. But you should always keep in memory that rates of return can be even less as there are a lot of other specific loan options for financing tuition, cars or houses. You may even not pay any interest if you use your own funds for that. If you stay still strong about receiving a personal loan, don’t forget to shop around and look after different options. Look at loan opportunities in different banks and don’t compare them only by rates offered. The final rate will depend on your credit score and maturity period so better seek better conditions and apply for five best of them (you can reject some offers but you will waste a lot of time if you get a rejection and only then apply for another lending).",1
"O ne can easily understand what makes roulette so attractive in land based casino, but even then some people tend to prefer playing online live version of this game. Whatever their reasons may be, one thing is for sure that Roulette is certainly the king of all casino games. The most attractive thing about playing physical roulette in a casino is the fact that this game come with a whole lot of charisma and crowd tends to get attracted automatically to it. This actuality can be wholly corroborated by the number of people thronging roulette tables in casinos. The other thing which makes roulette so popular is its pace. Unlike poker it is a fast paced game and even the bystanders enjoys watching it. On the other hand it is slower then Craps, but there is nothing to watch there. In contrast to other casino games, multiple people can participate in this game at the same time. There are various claims about a roulette systems that can guarantee a win etc. According to bestroulettesystems.com there is no best system for roulette that can guarantee you a win, but there are ways that you can decrease the house edge and have more of a chance of winning. Traditional Roulette vs. Online Live Roulette There is a major difference between virtual online roulette and online live roulette. The first one is controlled by gaming software while the second one is administered by a human being. There is not much difference between traditional roulette and live roulette as both of these versions are administered and controlled by a croupier. In online live roulette, a player only uses software to make a wager, while everything else is done physically in a studio and aired live. The only major difference between these two variants is that a player is required to visit a casino to participate in traditional roulette. In live roulette you can participate in your favourite game from the safe and secure environment of your home. Easy to Understand and Learn In comparison to other casino games, roulette is quite easy to understand and learn. There are no complicated rules or sophisticated skills required to play this game. In majority of cases in casinos, the bystanders tend to step forward to participate. This can be attributed to the simplicity of roulette. In other popular games like poker, a player must be skilful to understand the complexity of the game. In roulette you just choose a number/colour and let your luck do the rest. Ease of Availability of Roulette A game can only become popular and followed by masses, if it is easily available. Roulette on this front surpasses all other games. This game is not only available at casinos, but also in the form of online as well as live version. There are also casino apps which can be easily downloaded on mobiles and allows the user to participate in their favourite game even while on the move. The other thing which can be attributed to this game is the social experience. Unlike other games you are not competing against other players. Even the number of players participating in the game does not influence the outcomes or the winnings. This helps in creating bonhomie as well as sense of fraternity between players participating in the game.",1
" “You ever been to Detroit? You ever walked down Skid Row? Been to Camden, New Jersey? What about St Louis, Missouri or Chicago? Luckily I have not, but I seen pictures and videos of those places.” The president was angry that much of America is now a shithole and wondered how it got that way. Botswana President “I don’t know. I got some president guy from Botswana, some place in Africa, coming up to me and saying that Detroit is a shithole. Please can someone tell me how most of America is now a shithole? It certainly was not like this before things turned nasty?” Mr. Trump, who is only surrounded by gold furniture, elaborate decor and the finest things in life has never been to Detroit, or walked down the slum of Skid Row, so he lives a closeted life that only the very rich can afford. Trump’s lavish golf courses, resorts, and hotels are a far cry from the places where immense poverty lies with homelessness, drugs and crime. “Why are these places in America shitholes? Why? I want to ask somebody, somewhere to tell me why Detroit is a wasteland, why gangs are all over the place shooting shit up, why there is so much homelessness in Skid Row? Someone must have the answer?” What can be done about America’s cities sweltering in the heat of poverty? “Like what the shit is goin’ on here? All I see is liquor stores, gangs and people on the streets. I don’t see an America that I thought was America. I suppose I never ventured into these places, probably because I’m white, privileged and damn rich!” Mr Trump, has also not mentioned American prisons where the population is made up of 70% black people. How about the fact that out of 171.3 million tax units, 77.5 million Americans—or 45.3 percent—didn’t pay income tax in 2015. American shithole cities are also blighted by gangs but that’s another story..",1
"This was due in part to its citizens emitting a long, deep breath expressing their relief that The Donald would not be setting foot across the pond any time soon. “The huge gusts of wind caused my papers to fly everywhere!” said Amir who distributes the Evening Standard outside of Oxford Circus tube Station. Though he was quick to add, “It wasn’t really an issue because people seemed so pleased by the headline news, that the papers were quickly picked up by passersby. In fact, I finished early that day!” A spokesperson for the British US Embassy explained that the winds caused minimal damage to the newly finished American Embassy at Nine Elms, stating that the response of the London population was “Completely understandable and mutually reciprocated by Embassy staff.” The spokesperson went on to reassure that there was “no doubt” that they would be able to find the money needed to make the repairs using the generous profits obtained in the sale of their Grosvenor Square property. Having been opposed to a visit by Trump for some time now, Mayor Sadiq Khan took to the president’s favourite form of communication by tweeting that “Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here […] It seems he’s finally got that message.” The Mayor soon followed up with a second tweet stating that he felt “Proud to witness the physical demonstration of Londoners’ disdain for Trump through today’s heavy winds.” With President Trump’s visit seemingly at bay for the near future, BBC meteorologists assured Londoners today that with winds now calming they could expect clouds to be returning to, once more, the usual gloomy grey London.",1
"Not only has the web become a place where a mere brain fart can give you a one way ticket to jail, it has become a Big Brother heaven where your every secret is logged, filed and can be used against you at any time. You are watched now at every step, and your details filed in data centres to be used by conglomerates, insurance companies, banks, and anyone else that pays for it. The advent of home organisers like Amazon echo now listen to your every conversation at home, and can easily be hacked to acquire whatever information is needed. The further shutting down of web freedoms through the misuse of copyright censorship; through the use of threatening reduction of ad revenue over an alternative viewpoint, and blatant misuse of censorship on social networks to limit speech is another nail in the coffin of the internet. We are now in a digital prison resembling an echo chamber of doublespeak, and the forces that are diluting free speech continue their foreboding quest for even more data, this time from within your own living room. How much data is enough? What more do these cantankerous denizens of clandestine surveillance want from the everyday joe? According to them, George Orwell’s Big Brother was nothing more than a manual on how to act, and this sickening reality is seen through the eyes of a dismayed bystander who never believed it would get this far. The curious part of the new Facebook Telescreen is that people are being asked to pay $499 to install the surveillance system in their homes. This ability to make people pay for their own surveillance either tells us that people are dumber than was thought previously or that Facebook is so arrogant that they actively think that people will pay for their own digital imprisonment. The internet, once a free portal of knowledge and creativity is now bogged down with bureaucracy, red tape, litigation and lies, its digital cogs messed up by the aspirations of mega tech companies, monoliths that dictate their rules and regulations to all and sundry. Where is the creative spirit that once burned through the internet, a free catalogue of knowledge, explored, discussed extending the human condition to higher heights? The creative spirit is now dead, crushed by corporate assholes, and demented bureaucratic number crunchers bereft of any humanity, or soul. ",1
"One would have really thought we had re-entered an age of puritanism with the way some feminists are conducting their campaigns of male hatred across the media. Enter, Catherine Deneuve, and a coterie of 100 other like-minded females who are sick to death of the anti-man world we seem to all live in now. It is quite telling that this is a French fight back against the mainly anglo-saxon puritanical feminists who have adopted the puritan Sovietized feminazi ideals of vindictive cultural-Marxist hatred. A breath of fresh air The French teach their children and students philosophy at every turn, and it is an important part of French culture. This is why they understand things much more than the dumbed-down American feminists who can only see things in black and white. In an open letter published in France’s Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday, 100 well-known female French writers, performers and academics, who co-signed the letter, said: “Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone’s knee or try to steal a kiss. “Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not – and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack. “What started out as a “legitimate protest against the sexual violence that women are subject to, particularly in their professional lives” has become a “witch-hunt” and led to a “puritanical wave of purification. “Instead of helping women, this frenzy to send these ‘pigs’ to the abattoir actually helps the enemies of sexual liberty – religious extremists and the worst sort of reactionaries. “As women, we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality. “[Women are] sufficiently aware that the sexual urge is by its nature wild and aggressive. But we are also clear-eyed enough not to confuse an awkward attempt to pick someone up with a sexual attack.” Naturally, there has been complete silence from the mainstream media on the account of the 100 intelligent real women who spoke up.",1

Patton You don’t know your place anymore, you think you’re a star, you live in a non binary trans world where half the English vocabulary is now forbidden, you would quite happily agree to every alternative viewpoint to your PC life being erased permanently. Your social justice warrior life is one of dedication to the Marxist homosexual lecturers who spurred you into action in the first place. Their lectures and speeches indoctrinated your young pliable mind into the ways of Marxism and communist ideals. The sad part of your life is you cannot change, you cannot see the point of view of others, you are blinkered to fall into line and continue your Soviet conditioning, you are dedicated to communist revolution. Imagine going up a rain soaked muddy field, the artillery bursting from all sides, arms and legs being blown off as men scream in agony, their steamy blood squirting from the stumps, as each heartbeat pumps more crimson into the air as a pink mist. You are no longer on campus demonstrating against the latest snowflake outrage, your friend just took some shrapnel between the eyes, burned right through his skull like a knife through butter. This is no Antifa march where you shout out gay slogans and pepper spray anyone who does not agree with your pathetic skewed message. Obama is no longer president, you’ve got to get that through your head. Chinese and Russian infantry rain down bullets on your position. You hide barely covered by a tree stump that is slowly dissolving with every volley. “I’m going to kill those commie yella bastards!” It feels good to say those words, they killed your buddies, they attacked us first, it is them or us. You are no longer a PC snowflake pussy with no guts or balls. Rushing up the hill, your boots soaked with mud and blood, the bullets tear through the air whizzing, hoping for a target. Finally you are confronted by a Chinese soldier, there is only purpose in his eyes, you raise your weapon and he raises his. Click! Does the Chinese soldier have any mercy, no is the cold answer as he digs his bayonet deep into your chest, if only you had realised what the real world was about sooner… The last thing you see before your consciousness fades into black is another thousand Chinese troops coming down the hill over the remaining American troops. War is the only answer to PC culture, everyday pray for war, pray for the compulsory draft, this is the only way the overgrown kids will finally grow up and find out who the true enemy is. Pray for all out war now.",1
"NHS Then and Now The NHS was once only available to British citizens, however today it is the world’s health service. With an ageing population, massive unfettered migration, and NHS tourists from all over the world, what hope is there for a health service that despite billions plowed into the bottomless black hole of annual funding, is dying a horrible death? To die in a corridor is the best most people can get these days, where the neglected thirsty patient checks out of this world, not with care but with the sacrifice of care. Hospital operations cancelled, as the Nigerians fly into Heathrow to deliver quintuplets for free, then fly back to Lagos never to be heard of ever again. Of course, the taxpayer foots the bill for each episode of NHS tourism. The opening of the gates for every Romanian and Bulgarian to come over to Britain and use up the NHS for free was another watershed moment in NHS history. Literally overnight, wards were full to brimming with gypsies, and EU’s poorest people demanding treatment. No wonder your neglected grandfather, who fought in the war is left to fend for himself in an NHS corridor as he calls for a nurse but is ignored. The irony is that Britain’s socialists introduced the NHS into being, yet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s watch it was destroyed by the introduction of mass unfettered migration from Europe and the Third World, policies that Labour enacted. By the intense population growth brought on by Labour, there is no room at your GP’s surgery, no room left in A&E, and no room for urgent medical attention at your local hospital. That’s because although there has been a large population increase caused by Labour, there has not been the funding, infrastructure change to compensate for the massive speedy increase. Britain must have immigration, but it must be controlled. This is where the socialists have erred, and this is why they have ruined their own creation — the NHS. Healthy, sustainable immigration, where the incoming population is vetted by profession, and integration value is the key to success, unfortunately, Britain has the opposite where most migrants from the poorest parts of Eastern Europe are unskilled, do not work and are a burden on Britain’s benefits system. As your relatives lie dying and uncared for on some trolley in a hospital corridor, think on this, somewhere else in the same hospital, a possible NHS tourist or other migratory statistic is taking up their bed and care. The NHS: created by Labour, and unceremoniously killed off by Labour.",1
"“Is he under the table? Is he behind that curtain?” Hollywood was up in arms on Thursday when three stars tweeted that Harvey Weinstein was in Los Angeles for the Golden Globes. Actress Rosanna Arquette on Facebook posted, “It is Very strange, that Harvey Weinstein is at the very same hotel in Beverly Hills that the golden globe press is being done at. I smell a Rat.” She also posted the message on Twitter, though the account @RoArquette is unverified. That’s when star Ellen Barkin responded from a verified account, “Is serial rapist harvey weinstein in los angeles? on the wknd of the Golden Globes. Why? WHy? WHY?” and also, “I forgot to say “alleged”…because i know better.” But Weinstein’s reps told rumour mongers of the disgraced movie mogul’s allegedly being in LA, “Harvey Weinstein is everywhere. Up your skirt. Under the bed. In your shoe closet.” Actresses are now in so much fear that many have to take counselling from professionals at the mere mention of Mr. Weinstein’s name. “I was coming back from a meal downtown when I passed a dark alley. I saw Weinstein watching me, and when I started running for my limo I heard his footsteps running after me too,” actress Jennifer Lawrence tweeted on Thursday. Weinstein has denied sexual assault allegations against him. His reps have repeatedly commented, “Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. The actresses who received starring roles in Weinstein brokered movies should be ashamed of themselves for jumping on the wagon.” A rep for Arquette revealed that Weinstein is “hiding in plain sight” and could be “frickin’ everywhere”. “Pulp Fiction” star Arquette is one of a number of actresses who have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and misconduct. She told some newspaper that her career suffered after she rejected a sexual advance from Weinstein in the early 1990s at the Beverly Hills Hotel where she allegedly attended a sauna session with the mogul in his hotel room. Her Thursday tweet that Weinstein was allegedly in town was quickly passed around among top Hollywood execs. Either way, industry pros are on the lookout for the former Miramax mogul. One woman film vet told us, “I was driving in LA and I saw a fat jewish guy get out of a car — and I was like, ‘Stop it, it’s Harvey!’ But it was not. That’s when I crashed my car injuring three people and killing two.” Women at this year’s Golden Globes are so freaked out at seeing Weinstein that many are scared to attend the red carpet event just in case he suddenly appears and does something unspeakable to them. Such is the hysteria that some actresses are hiring multiple bodyguards for the event and some are even packing heat, with registered firearms in case Weinstein suddenly jumps out of a tree or comes at them from behind a stage wall or something.",1
"T he city is believed to be relatively young in comparison to other cities of the Middle East but it has its own charm, and worth being visited. It is easy to get to Amman because there is a very good international connection. Even if there is no direct flight from your city, you are offered to choose one of the most convenient transfer flight options. You might be surprised that some direct flights such as London to Amman flights are quite regular. Once you get to Amman, your journey begins. Top Places To See In Amman Citadel. One of the most popular places in Amman is the place known as Citadel. This breathtaking site located on the highest hill. This is where the Temple of Hercules and the Ummayad Palace are situated. Locals say that every year thousands of tourists come here every day to enjoy the beauty of the nature and explore architectural masterpieces. Roman Theatre. The second most popular site in Amman is the Roman Theatre, which is also an impressive remnant of Roman architecture. The theatre is located on the hill and has around 6000 seats. Tourists, who adore taking photos, usually come here in the morning when the light is right. Archeologists are convinced that the theatre was built in the 2nd century AD but it was restored in 1957. Even though modern materials were used to refresh the look of the construction, it is still impressive and beautiful. What is more important is that concerts sometimes are held there in summer. Jordan Museum. If you love history, you should definitely visit the Jordan Museum. The museum is said to be one of the best museums in the Middle East, and for a good reason. It is placed in a nice and modern building, and presents information in interesting and modern displays. The design of displays makes the old historical facts look modern and advanced. The museum tells about first people, their culture and how it was progressing. There are upstairs and downstairs galleries, but some of them might be closed for renovation. Before visiting the museum make sure that they are opened. Darat Al Funun. Fans of contemporary art are recommended to visit Darat Al Funun. It is a cultural paradise located, just like many things in Amman, on the hillside. There is a wonderful art gallery that displays works of modern artists. Cultural workshops, various forums and other events are also frequently arranged in Darat Al Funun. You can easily check the schedule of all events on the Internet. Near the main building of museum tourists can find an old Byzantine church. If you are planning to visit Darat Al Funun, it is easier to get there on foot. People who have visited Jordan and Amman, in particular, claim that it is a must-see city. Include the city of your must-visit place and you will get a lot of new impressions and emotions.",1
"We have seen the slithering Tony Blair at countless meetings with Jean Claude Juncker and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr. Blair flies to Brussels nearly every week to get his latest briefing and orders, and more than likely clandestine brown envelopes filled with much wonga. “We can of course transfer to any one of your Swiss accounts,” a well-suited EU denizen explains to Blair. Like many of the quislings and treasonous traitors to British interests, the only interest Tony Blair has in the EU Brexit stance is money. “The more money Tony makes, the better he feels. He is quite happy to broker deals with Indonesian despots, African tyrants, and crooked Eurocrats all on the take. There is no indignity he will fall to, and betraying the people of Britain is a delight to Blair, he actually gets a kick out of being the Lord Haw Haw of British politics,” a Westminster commentator revealed. MPs in Westminster who are actively working to reverse Brexit are all on the EU take, but they don’t just go for cash payoffs, that would be too vulgar, they instead get their little initiatives boosted where they cream off the money for themselves without anyone else noticing. Only the devil knows how much Blair is getting for his efforts, but one can be sure that he is not doing all of this for free. Without the Brussels payoffs there would not be much movement from the Blair apart from a few quips here or there. His concerted, well financed campaign screams of Brussels money, much like the other MPs who Remoan on a daily basis in Westminster.",1
"M ost of Internet users seem to be careless to their cyber security. It is no longer a secret that Microsoft receives millions of reports that describe users activity in details. They have access to browser history (even incognito mood is helpless here), all search requests and even our cameras. Seems like your webcam is off? It still can be working and you have no clue about it. It might seem like there is nothing special about your Internet activity, but at least it does not feel good when someone can see you staring at the screen with only your undies on. This is why experts recommend all users get their VPNs and use them for every login. Most of people are bothered with one single question: ‘How does a VPN work?’, and here’s an answer: Get Started With a VPN To start using any VPN – just download a distributive pack and install it at your device. There exist VPN application for computers, tablets and smartphones. Choose the right version based on your operating system. VPNs can be free or the ones you should pay for. Charges are relatively low and anyone can afford them. The difference between these VPN types is significant. Free applications provide only basic functions like dynamic IP while those at a cost provide a number of additional options like: speed boost, traffic control, ad block, brandmauer. Algorithm What is a VPN? This service works like a tunnel between computer and server. For instance, during your regular search, as soon as any address or search request is dialed – computer gets connected to that very server that holds the website you are looking for. In case of working VPN – a signal is transmitted to a virtual server in ‘tunnel’ where all data get encrypted. Virtual server changes your IP address and only after that reaches a website. This is how users stay anonymous and protected. Freedom Taking into consideration all written above we can say that VPNs make us completely invisible for spies, hackers and even silent services. Moreover, we get access to all content, even the one that is banned in our country. If you think nobody can be watching you as the most boring person alive – you are wrong. Check ads on websites you visit – they all meet your interests, VPN grants us with new IP for every session and virtually takes us to different countries every time we log in. Safety Warning There exist a lot of fakes. So, before choosing your application – make sure that is the one to trust. Check its creation date and reputation among users. They often share their impressions on various forums. Avoid apps without users feedback or the ones that appeared recently. It is better to avoid risks when it comes to safety. Conclusion Above all, it is significant to take into account that no matter what methods you use online, if somebody — in particular if that ‘somebody’ is an international institution — wants to get their hands on your information, then they almost definitely will. However, using a VPN might make their work more difficult.",1
" “Kim Jong-Un knows what he is doing absolutely 110%. According to our intelligence reports, North Korea has a 1.2 million strong army making it the fourth largest in the world, among them more than 100,000 special forces. Although its military hardware dates back to the Soviet era, North Korea has more tanks than the United States (3500 compared with 2381) and more artillery pieces than China. “Its nuclear fissile material is enough for at least 20 nuclear weapons, possibly as many as 100, depending on their size. (According to the Arms Control Association, the U.S. has 1411 strategic nuclear warheads.) “The recent UN sanctioned oil embargo has not succeeded as Chinese petroleum ships have been photographed at North Korean ports. This Chinese provocation, has also been another problematic variable in the equation. Additionally, Russia has weighed in with threats of siding with North Korea if any conflict were to escalate to conventional warfare, or nuclear. “Because North Korea is so exposed, it may resort to nuclear operations as an opening gambit. Guam, or Southern Korean U.S. bases would be the natural target as an opener, to see the reaction of the Trump organisation. If Trump tries to target N. Korean nuclear facilities this intermediate action would further cause an escalation of nuclear proliferation resulting in mass detonations possibly on the Eastern seaboard cities in the United States. “With Russia and China siding with Kim Jong-un and in alignment on the crisis, there may also be further escalation not only with China’s ambitions on Taiwan, but Russia’s Ukraine push could go further into Europe, or to former Soviet states within Europe — Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. “Having already encountered skirmishes in 2008, in Eurasian Georgia, Russia has many options into its next move. The worst case scenario of course is an incursion into Poland and Finland. The latter, would be vanquished in less than a day as Putin’s troops cut through the European peninsula like a knife through butter. Poland recently begged NATO for a more sustained military presence. “Strategically, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the United States is a plan that would be a serious threat, however N. Korea would not cripple military facilities because they would be protected from EMP. N. Korea would therefore reap the full wrath of a nuclear response from the U.S. “The interplay of numerous factions within the geopolitical field during this time, must not dismiss the Iranian threat that could escalate if N. Korea is somehow roused to act, when the U.S. comes down on the isolated communist nation. Although a supposed deal was reached with the Iranian regime to reduce its number of centrifuges by two thirds in 2015, in March 2016, Iran test-fired two Qadr ballistic missiles, and further medium-range tests in January 2017 prompted further sanctions brought on the regime. There is no going back, Iran may have signed a tenuous agreement hailed by former president Obama, but the country has many secret nuclear facilities that are still under operation. This is something that is not being reported by any other public entities. “Analysis of major data sets and simulations result in an almighty ‘clusterfuck’. This means that the slightest escalation in any given area, would result in movement not only from the Chinese, but the Russians and Iranians, as well as the North Koreans. This is what we call a hornet’s nest situation eventually escalating to complete worldwide conventional warfare, concluding with nuclear warfare. “The cleanest option is to disarm N. Korea through the use of conventional attack, without China or Russia or Iran moving. Naturally, there would have to be swift movement into the country from air, sea and land immobilising all nuclear facilities before they can be utilised. EMP strikes on North Korea are also an option, and can be simultaneously utilised during the initial strike. By eradicating the high command structure of N. Korea, the people would be leaderless and fall into line almost immediately. The key to completion of this task is clinical planning and implementation without any interference from Russia or China, which is highly unlikely.”",1
"T en years later there is a new $800 billion cryptocurrency industry, thousands of newly minted millionaires and a massive decentralised computer spread across the globe. And, there is no Satoshi Nakamoto. The man has disappeared. No one even knows if he ever existed. In all likelihood, Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym used by an individual or a group of individuals. Or a supernatural being. The only thing we can be sure of is that Bitcoin is here to save the world. Fiat money is designed by the government to steal our wealth by inflating the money supply. Bitcoin was designed by the benevolent Satoshi to make us all rich. Some people say Bitcoin is in a bubble. That’s impossible. The supply of Bitcoin is limited which means it can’t be a bubble. And anyway, Bitcoin investors are a fearless bunch and don’t care about bubbles and other nonsense. If anything’s in a bubble, it’s fiat currencies. Speaking of bubbles, there’s a bubble in the number of people saying Bitcoin is a bubble. And in the number of people missing out on Bitcoin. Most of the critics are jealous because they missed out. But not to worry, if you’ve missed out on making the easy Bitcoin profits, you can win some playing Bitcoin jackpots or on one of the Bitcoin gambling sites. The naysayers have also pointed out that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies aren’t really being used for anything other than speculation. They say that if it was really the future, Amazon would be accepting payments in Bitcoin. That might be true, but you have to remember that Jeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world – when measured in US Dollars. So, if Bitcoin became more popular than the dollar, Bezos would lose his number one spot. It’s just not in his interest to support Bitcoin. And yes, we all know that Microsoft has now stopped accepting payments in Bitcoin. They said it’s because the price is too volatile. But we all know it’s really because they can’t figure out what to do with all the Bitcoin they already have in their Bitcoin wallet. It would be quite embarrassing if they had to explain to shareholders that they made more profit on their Bitcoins than they did selling software. And then there’s the old valuation story. How do you value an instrument that doesn’t pay interest or dividends, and that doesn’t own tangible assets? The answer quite simply is that Bitcoin isn’t a stock or a bond or a conventional currency. It’s a crypto asset which means things like earnings and cash flows don’t apply. So, what is a crypto asset worth? It’s simple really – crypto assets are worth more than the price they are trading at. Always! It’s quite clear to anyone who’s paying attention that Bitcoin is worth a lot more than the current price. And if anyone disagrees tell them to go speak to Satoshi Nakamoto.",1
"The year 2017 was the year that the phrase ‘fake news’ was brought into the political media circus, a melee of accusatory missives lost in a mire of seditious melancholy. “Fake news was the term that summed up something yet nothing, because the term itself is fake, it is a catch-all term that can be used for pretty much anything. In our reality, how do we check if anything is real or unreal? Most of the stuff one reads in mainstream media is overclocked journalism, headlines engineered as clickbait, over-exaggeration is the norm in today’s journalism and is used on a constant basis to attract viewers. There is very little reality in today’s journalism where sensationalism is applauded by media editors, and half-truths are presented as whole truths. We now live in a world where a Twitter hashtag can ruin someone’s career in seconds — without a trial or jury. All it takes is a few people to spread a rumour utilising a well known Twitter hashtag and the target is almost indefensible. Their lives ruined by rumour and fake news,” someone of not much importance said at a bus stop today. Yes, the Russians are inherently evil and are working every day to undermine Western ideals, media, business, but let us look at it this way, were the Russians pushed towards their anti-Western behaviour by the previous American president? Indeed, one could say, Obama was the reason Putin invaded Ukraine, he was also the reason the Russians gave up on playing nice with the West. This is why Vlad started those troll factories churning out anti-establishment propaganda 24 hours a day. Now that Obama is gone, and the friendly Trump is in, maybe East-West relations may simmer down. It is true to say that the Russians could never tolerate a negroid president dictating stuff to them, yet, is it the Russians’ fault that they rarely get to see a black man anyway, how could they respect Obama? The Russian problem, therefore could be put down to racism as a major factor, because outside of the politically correct circles racism does exist, and it always will exist whatever the so-called non-racists say. Racism is a human condition that cannot be controlled or eradicated — ever. Fake news, contrary to belief, has of course been around since the dawn of publishing or story telling. Take one look at the Christian bible to see the biggest load of fake news ever written. It was written by anonymous people just as the old Roman Empire was in major decline and adopted tales from all over the world to incorporate into its story line. Jesus Christ, of which there is no record of him ever living, is the biggest load of fake news ever. Jesus is just a model of every sun god from Krishna to Horus. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an ancient Sumerian cuneiform text reveals that the Noah’s Ark story is a blatant copy the Christians always seem to brush under the carpet. The point that is trying to be revealed here is that blind faith is a precursor for fake news. Christians blindly believe the conjured up supernatural fairy nonsense in the bible as fact, yet they have no record of backing up the book as reality. This is the biggest fake news story of all time, but yet it is impossible to relate this to a Christian, who has been brainwashed throughout the ages, generationally, traditionally, as part of this certain club. There is no reasoning with anyone who is prepared to blindly believe something purely on faith, because in effect, you could tell them any sort of fake news and they would believe it hook line and sinker. If one transmutes this fake news belief throughout the generations it gets stronger and stronger. This is how fake news becomes almost a reality through belief, yet its foundations are built on a fake swamp of shit. The key to fake news being believed over and over again is repetition over a long period of time. In other news, fake news, the term, may have a quieter year in the future, however as a hammer to bang whole organisations on the head with, it is useful to whoever is using it, and whatever their agenda is. No doubt, we will have sporadic episodes of fake news, little vomitous splurges here or there. The future looks bright, much like the past, the future looks fake.",1
"Important, Quality Materials for Precision Manufacturing When we talk about steel, there are three territories that we immediately think of. These come with both positive and negative connotations but these preferences also depend on the use that the steel will be put to. To start with we have EU/UK origin steel – the EN standard is a certified stamp of approval, made with quality controlled raw materials, precise and to bespoke requirements. More often than not, with quality comes price, and in a tough market, sometimes that’s not feasible for everyone. But price becomes less important when complex hi tech products need to be manufactured on short lead times .This now is the reality of British and EU metals manufacturing . Next, we have Brazilian steel – currently facing tough times, the Brazilian steel industry has seen a 9.2% reduction in crude steel production and a 7.7% reduction in rolled steel production. While the steel might not be up to the British mark – the quality isn’t the worst, but shipping prices and the logistics of shipping cross globe can make this a problem industry to source steel from. However it fulfils and important role in satisfying the remaining and much reduced general steels heavy manufacturing sector We also have Indian steel. There are many negative connotations around Indian steel – the main one being the quality of the product. For example, Indian steel pipework is known not to be the best in keeping in heat! However, this industry flourishes with low cost products, easy to deliver steel and quick turnaround times, making production with Indian steel something of a fast turnaround product. The quality of Indian steel is improving, and in other material types such as nickel based alloys you can find very high quality manufacturers here too. Overall, when considering the purchasing of steel products, the typical iron triangle of ‘time vs cost vs quality’ can be considered – if you could pick two of the three, which are more important to you? Currently, Britain is seeing a change in focus towards smaller scale added value precision manufacturing. Inevitably quality and time have become of more focus than price. This will only benefit the British manufacturing sector moving forward into the modern era! Hardened and Tempered Steel The hardening and tempering process of carbon steel production is used predominantly for blades and cutting tools. Carbon steel is hardened through a heat treatment process, this can be tailored to customers particular hardness requirements. Strip and coil Steel strip derives from an on-going process of reducing the steel thickness using rolling, pickling and cold-rolling and controlling the temper and ductility . This is a bespoke process producing steels which meet individual customer specifications . Precision Wire Precision wire is the process of creating specific steel or nickel based wires that are conditioned and manufactured based on tolerances and specification so that they may be used in specific environments and applications. Precision wire could be anything from stainless steel fine wire, copper nickel resistance wire and shunt alloy, profiled wire, thermocouple wire, Dumet wire, welding wire to very tight tolerances. Thin walled tube These small diameter tubes are produced in seamless or welded and redrawn condition. Using the latest in laser welding, these tubes are manufactured based on application in order to deliver thin walled tubes that meet bespoke application requirements. Depending on the application we can tailor mechanical properties and surface conditions. Purchasing Steel and metals with a known provenance The aforementioned products can all be sourced, manufactured to requirements and delivered by Avocet Steel Strip Ltd. When sourcing from this British supplier you ensure that you source from accredited partners and you source only the finest materials.",1
" Well, yes. Below we’re running through five things that definitely won’t be happening in English football in 2018. Liverpool Won’t Win the League AGAIN “This is our year… no, no, next year, next year is our year. I mean…” Sorry, Reds: We don’t care how good Mo Salah is. You are not winning the Premier League title anytime soon. Indeed, the 30-year anniversary of your last league title is fast approaching. Maybe a commemorative shirt is in order? Mourinho Won’t Be Happy Bless him. How can someone who spent just £237 million on players in the space of 18 months be expected to win any major title? His old nemesis, Pep Guardiola, is firing on all cylinders across the city, so it’s unsurprising that Mourinho isn’t happy at all. So much so, he is still living in a hotel despite being in Manchester for over a year. For the first time in over 15 years and in his sixth role during that time, Mourinho isn’t going to win a league title in his first two years at a club. It was a remarkable record, but it’s coming to an end. Maybe winning the Champions League could cheer up the Portuguese. Although United are a pretty lengthy 14/1 in football betting odds to do so. England Won’t Win the World Cup You know what: England’s team isn’t that bad, is it? We’ve got Harry Kane, one of the top strikers in the world. Then there’s Raheem Sterling in the form of his life at arguably the best team in the world right now, as well as other exciting young prospects like Dele Alli, John Stone and Jordan Pickford coming through the ranks. Nevertheless, England aren’t going to win the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Don’t kid yourself – save the pain. If you are a dreamer though, you can pick up odds of 7/1 of England winning the World Cup this year. Wenger Won’t Leave Arsenal One thing you can be sure of in 2018, is that regardless of how well Arsenal perform, Arsene Wenger will dig in his heels and not leave the Emirates. Whether you are in the #wengerin or #wengerout camp, Wenger should undoubtedly go down as the greatest manager in Arsenal’s history. But will he risk that legacy by staying on for yet another season? You better believe it. Messi Won’t Be Coming For those of you who think Ronaldo is better than Messi purely because “he’s done it in the Premier League”, you are buffoons. Lionel Messi is the greatest of all-time and a Barcelona legend. And no matter how many times he’s linked with a move to the Premier League – and especially a beautiful reunion with Pep Guardiola – it would simply be astonishing to see the little wizard leaving Barcelona now.",1
"Hollywood moguls are planning another onslaught of dumb American superhero movies for the new year it has been revealed. “Just when you thought culture, or what’s left of it can’t get more fucking banal these money grabbing lazy assholes in the Hollywoodland movie biz are planning on hundreds more superhero movies, however, news is they’re running out of superheroes to make films of. We are now getting superhero films of superhero groups within superhero groups like mixing Batman with Superman and so on. It’s getting so tedious that people are getting genuinely pissed off about it. You seen the cinema attendance record lately?” Aldous Muxley, a cinema critic wrote in his latest newspaper article. No More Creativity Superheroes now come in all shapes, races, sexuality and sizes, some being conjured up according to whatever socialist agenda is the taste of the day. We witnessed the resurrection of Wonder Woman for the almighty feminist agenda, and the African Americans are to get their own black Panther superhero to sate the appetite of the angry disenfranchised black cinema going audiences.. What we need now is maybe a Sikh superhero or Chinese one, why do superheroes only have to be black or white, why not a lighter shade of brown or Oriental? Transexual lesbian Filipino superheroes from outer space with five milky breasts under each arm squirting universal teat juice into the eyes of criminals everywhere. Alien superhero spawn that don’t even live on planet earth or care about it or look human, they’re just blobs, green fatty blobs that fly around splatting on the walls or messing up windows with their greasy jello skin? Insect superheroes, or superhero penguins from Iceland could forge a good global warming warning for the millennial generation. “We’re coming up with an Eskimo superhero called Igloo. He has shamanic powers and lives in an…igloo somewhere in the North Pole,” an elated executive of Warner Bros. recently revealed in Entertainment Weekly. How about a Hollywood film that has no superheroes? Maybe something with a real plot, real fucking actors and a script that lasts more than the lifecycle of a bargain bin? ",1
"Kim Jong-Un set up an amazing fireworks show for the people this new year with an amazing explosive extravaganza that wowed everyone. The 200 megaton explosion flattened much of the capital city, Pyongyang, and spectators were in awe for approximately 2.3 seconds before being vapourised by the bomb. Dropped directly onto the Juche Tower monument as fervent broadcast announcers ushered in the new year, the explosion was viewed from space by astronauts in the International Space Station. “They’re having one hell of a new year in North Korea,” one astronaut quipped whilst sipping vodka from a bag. Speaking on North Korean state television just before the detonation, Kim Jong-Un spoke utter gibberish and was sporting a floppy cowboy hat with a large peacock feather stuck on the top of it. Frothing at the mouth, he was speedily ushered into his private bunker by senior state officials and army personnel. Unfortunately the radiation cloud created by the North Korean firework is drifting towards Japan, however scientists say that the Japanese are all irradiated anyway, therefore a little more won’t hurt. On hearing of the firework, U.S President, Donald Trump said: “I told that boy not to play with fireworks. Looks like he’s gone and nuked his own capital city. Dang, I wanted to do that, the SOB beat me to it.”",1
"At the moment, there is a vast media push where Remainers, or Remoaners are given a voice to downgrade Britain, to put forward their anti-Brexit agenda, and to derail any form of political progress with the current EU negotiations to leave. This is a deep-state exit emergency where the media is being utilised to effectively sell Britain down the EU road. When you have councils given the go-ahead to increase tax by 40%, when you have the taxman punishing entrepeneurs who backed Brexit, when you have the media giving Remainers centre stage access to full-page articles to spread their pro-EU bias, you know for certain that this is another wave of attack on Brexit. The concerted attack on leaving the EU is being conducted from within the British state, and is being directly advised from Brussels. In days of past when people in government actually cared for Britain and its world-standing, Remainers would have been viewed as traitors or as conducting treason, however, because many have taken large pay-offs from Brussels, they no longer hold allegiance to the UK. It is purely a monetary issue for the Remainers, they are willing to betray their country for money. For those of you who voted in good faith on June 23, 2016, to leave the EU, unfortunately, the people’s vote has been sidelined. The opinion of the people is of no value to the traitorous scum Remainers paid off by Brussels. These people are embedded in the highest echelons of all state departments, the media, and orchestrate their agenda with timed precision, backed by the government departments state. Whitehall, intelligence, BBC, tax, foreign office, treasury, universities, home office, the media. The people effectively have only one voice, that is the sound of their feet. Referendums do not work because they are counteracted by the controlling body after the vote. Either there will be another concerted vote by the people (including the silent ones) in the next election, which is now possibly going to be delayed till 2022) that will usher in a true Brexit force, or we have the other option which is the ultimate solution — complete civil unrest. Treachery is always eventually punished, especially on those who seek to rob the people. One can only hope for the glorious day when Remainers are given their just desserts for abandoning their country for payoffs from Brussels. These parasites should be given no mercy, their treachery consigned to the lamppost they swing from. ",1
" He took five of the eight Grand Slams in those two seasons before injury started to catch up with him towards the end of 2016. Djokovic has been rarely seen on the court ever since. However, the Serbian star is set to make his comeback at the Mubadala World Tennis Championships, held in Abu Dhabi. You can check out his thoughts on his comeback covered by the telegraph magazine. The three-day tournament will be the first time that Djokovic has played since aggravating an elbow injury nearly five months ago. Crucially, it will give the 12-time Grand Slam winner some much-needed court time before the Australian Open starts on 15th January. It will be interesting to see how Djokovic copes with such a little amount of preparation before the event in Melbourne. Bookies Convinced Djokovic Can Bounce Back Djokovic is currently ranked as joint-favourite with Roger Federer at 3/1 (Ladbrokes) to win the Australian Open title. This places him just ahead of Rafael Nadal (7/2) and Andy Murray (7/1), who both have suffered injury problems of their own in recent years. It will be fascinating to see if all four of these players, who have dominated men’s tennis over the last decade, are 100% fit. If so, fans are in for a treat in 2018’s first Grand Slam. Punters could have a bit of conundrum when picking a winning bet for the Australian Open though, as injury lay-offs mean Djokovic and Murray will not be taking their usual places at the top of the seedings. At the time of writing, Djokovic is seeded 12th and Murray 16th. This could lead to a potential clash with either Federer or Nadal in the quarter-finals or last 16. It also means there is a chance for a ‘dark horse’ player with big odds making their way to the final. Before betting, check out http://www.freebets.co.uk/offers-and-promotions/ to see if you bag a free tennis bet for the tournament. Time for Other Players to Step Up Whether or not Djokovic returns with the same imperious form remains to be seen. However, there is still a chance for other players to really grab their opportunity at the top of the men’s game. Despite brilliant form in 2017, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal cannot go on at the top forever. The time seems ripe for a couple of new stars to start winning multiple Grand Slams. One such candidate could be 20-year-old Alexander Zverev. He won two Masters titles in 2017 and qualified for the season-ending ATP World Tennis Finals in November. The young German has bags of potential, but also respect for the brilliance of legends like Federer. You can read the young man’s thoughts on his future at the article about him made by the Independent Magazine. Incidentally, Ladbrokes have priced him at 11/1 to win the Australian Open. To do so, he may have to beat a certain Serbian tennis master along the way.",1
"We are ushered into the inner Sanctum of a Momentum squad building somewhere in deepest Islington, a place where the champagne flows deep and the socialism even deeper. “Mind your step!” a woman in a Greenpeace jumper shouts, as our crew is pushed through narrow corridors going downwards into an inner sanctum that seems endless. The memorabilia on the walls is unmistakable, here we have old Soviet posters urging class struggle, and pictures of Lenin jumping over barricades, and Hezbollah masked men shooting at Jews. These are all recipes for a healthy revolution on a Downing Street that has been governed by the Tories for quite some time now, simply because Labour can’t be trusted with the purse strings after their massive spending spree under Blair and Brown. The country still has not recovered from Labour’s economic blitz on Britain’s coffers, but Corbyn and his crew want to make the ultimate grade this time around. Suddenly out of nowhere, the bearded one appears, he stands under a single naked bulb swinging erratically. Looking like some sort of Vietcong General, Corbyn ushers us into a tiny room where wall charts plaster every surface. “The plan is to get into Number 10 by any means possible. We utilise the young, the naive, the politically infantile who have not seen and experienced what a Labour government is. We will make every promise under the sun to these people and they, not knowing any better, will believe us. Once we are in power, we will spend until the coffers are empty, lose the next election to the Tories who will right the books again, then we will come back for more spending. You see the Tories do not spend, but we do.” The Soviet technique of repetition is a well-known method in getting the message across, and this is a Labour favourite. “Yes, repetition, repetition, repetition until the people cannot see anything else? Repeat a lie enough times, and it becomes a truth. This is our technique, and it is a truly tried and tested method that works on the people. The plebs, the people cannot be trusted, this is why it is up to the Politburo to dictate to them what has to be done, what has to be read, what tasks they must do to achieve our approval.” What about Theresa May, who seems to be holding on to the reins of power with quite a tight grip? “Her position is not assured. If there is another internal leadership squabble, we will go for a General Election call. Our teams up and down the country, our student faculties who all voted twice for me, we are organised, we are determined. You see these socks (pointing to red socks on slippers), these socks will assure me a Number 10 position because they are an assured symbol of my intention, and this is what people need. They want British Rail, they want British Gas, and they want a Royal Mail for the people, not for the companies. I want to travel British Rail and eat a soggy cheese and tomato British Rail fucking sandwich. This is what I want and this is what millions of people who will vote for me want. Get it?” Suddenly, out of the darkness one of Momentum’s rottweiler feminazi mustachioed women comes up behind us, grabs us by the nape of our necks and drags us out through a back entrance. Time is up, and Corbyn has some important preparations to make.",1
"You will slowly notice that information that used to be accessible before will be either reduced or removed. The smart grid is changing, and now Google will be supreme master of everything without any competition ever again. Sanctioned by the government, information will slowly disappear without trace. Anything that is not sanctioned or created by government will disappear, never to be seen ever again. Anything that is not created by government will be deemed as fake and erased. History, now all digital, will be easily changed, easily deleted if not useful to the agenda. You won’t notice it at first, but soon you may search for something and come up with something completely different to what you used to know was real, but in the future, you will not have any reference point any more unless you have the original books, just the answer they serve up to you. Snow is black they will say, and without any reference or detail, the future brainwashed individual will believe it without question. The Smart Grid, the Internet of Everything will listen to your every conversation, tracks your every move, checks your every motive, and predicts your next move. Once the cashless grid is brought into fruition, the shutting down of complete human freedom will be possible. It will happen globally in one go, and you will not have a chance to survive or live without the cashless system. Elements like Twitter and Facebook are already changing the way human’s think. Human mind processes and linguistics are being simplified, adapted into machine speak, and human behaviour is adapting to the creations these masters over you have created. You are part of the digital mind prison, an echo chamber where you are now completely at their control. To be without Twitter or Facebook now to you is impossible, and it is this thought that means you are now a controlled digital slave, a corporate digital monkey not worthy of being called human any more. From the digital prison, the Hive Mind is born, and you can already see this in social networks like Twitter and Facebook, where news travels through the hive in concert to its deliverance by the controllers who released whatever it is into the grid. The controllers watch and see how the hive reacts to certain types of information in concert, this way they can be alerted of any danger to their person in real-time, and in predictive-mode.

"A nd as you overindulge over the holidays this time out, you’re probably telling yourself that as soon as January hits you’ll get healthy. We’ve all been there. Those grand plans of exercising every day and eating healthy food tend to start off so well. Some people even contemplate attempting “Dry January.” But by the time February hits, the takeaway menus are back out and the gym membership has been swept under a carpet somewhere. So how can you make a real go of the fitness and dieting in 2018? Check out this guide for some easy tips. Start Getting Creative in the Kitchen Healthy eating and enjoyable eating aren’t often thought about in the same sentence. Or at least that’s the case for people who haven’t managed to step onto and keep hold of the fitness ladder for more than a few months. Those who do live a healthy lifestyle and eat the right foods day in, day out, will tell you that these dishes have become their comfort foods and they get real pleasure from eating them. In 2018, there’s no need to say goodbye to the comfort foods that you loved in 2017. According to Deliveroo’s list of popular foods for the soul, American classics like burgers and fries are the most comforting. These aren’t ideal for your new regime, but there are ways of still enjoying them by using fresh and lean ingredients. You could easily make these foods at home. For the burgers, grind up some meat with a minimal fat content and season it to your liking before shaping it into patties and grilling it. Top with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and goats’ cheese for a healthy burger. When making the fries, chop up some sweet potatoes and cook them in olive oil. There you have it; some junk food classics revamped for your new way of life. Get Some Fitness Equipment at Home Many people fork out on gym memberships in January and, when the motivation diminishes a few months later, they fail to get their money’s worth. For some, just biting the bullet and going to the gym on a daily basis is the major stumbling block, and if they were there they would find it easy to get into the zone. So how about bringing the gym to you? The price that some fitness centres charge these days is a small fortune, so using that money to buy fitness equipment for your own home could be a logical alternative. Seeing the treadmill or rowing machine will remind you to work out, and you could even do it while watching your favourite shows on TV. Another added bonus is the fact that you won’t have to share the space with all the self-obsessed selfie-takers usually found in gyms. Getting into shape this New Year will take some motivation, but if you get into good habits at home then it will be easier to maintain. And also, if you fork out money on gym equipment you don’t want it to end up gathering dust.",1
"Oh yeah, there is a new Star Wars film doing the rounds, but it is so crap and unmemorable that we actually forgot to write up a review of it. The film is a mismatch of different scenes plonked onto one stale piece of moribund shit, that is frankly a disservice to any Star Wars fan, or anyone who watches any type of film for that matter. The funny thing is it’s not a film because it does not really have a storyline or plot but sort of meanders along with little battle scenes plonked in every few minutes. Snoke, a deadly Sith lord, who is supposed to be very powerful, is chopped in half by a wayward lightsaber accident within the first few minutes of encountering him. Such a terrible waste, not only of Siths but of action scenes. Obviously the film-makers were way too lazy to bother having a full-on fight with a Sith lord, instead he gets chopped in half like some pathetic piece of mutton in a Halal butcher’s shop down in Leytonstone on a Saturday afternoon. The rest of the film is too stupid and boring to even mention. Luke Skywalker is a miserable old fart who is found on a Scottish island milking odd prosthetic plastic creatures’ fleshy teats and fishing with a long pole. Finn is the token black bloke in space who always looks surprised and sweaty in a space suit. Princess Leia, in reality was so coked up on drugs she did not know where the fuck she was, and this showed in the film as she stumbles from one scene to another looking like a Hollywood botox casualty on multiple lines snorted from the star ship’s dashboard. The female heroine of the film, has her hair pulled so far back on her head that she resembles a Croydon chavette in space. The only thing missing is a pair of hoop earrings, a crying baby and a fucking tracksuit. Kylo Ren, or whatever his name is as well as his sidekick are spoiled little brats having tantrums in space. It’s one tantrum after another, as they fling pieces of lego around the set. The finale, with a teleported astral vision of Luke doing a walkabout is the only bit worthy of the whole film. That is it. The rest of it is absolute bollocks. Oh, one last mention, the crimson red background and Elite Praetorian Samurai-esque guards for Snoke were pretty cool..that’s it though.. Star Wars used to be something special. Those days are all gone. Now it is something resembling Harry Potter or some other cutesy Hollywood crud that is simply a vehicle for some new director to establish himself in the biz. The formulaic nature of the new Star Wars films skimps on introducing new characters, new innovations and new story lines instead delving into a tired old soap opera consisting of just a few mediocre characters following each other around in space in an endless circle. It is probably too late but if you are going to see this film, do not pay for it, because this would encourage more of its ilk to be made. Simply go onto the many streaming services on the net and watch it for free in full HD. ",1
"A mongst the squabbling caterwauling ingrates of parliament, the treasonous swine Remoaning shit barnacles, and the ever appeasing Remoaner Theresa May — if there is no real Brexit, then the people will simply take the quarrel to the streets with a little bit of required civil unrest, and all that sort of stuff. “It will make the Poll Tax riots look like an evening tea party at the vicarage. We’re talking every town, every city in Britain burning from the inside out. “We’re talking Remoaners being lynched on lamp posts, burned in their cars, beaten to death by mobs of angered citizens who have just about had enough. As for the duration of the riots? “We’re talking ten to thirty years of civil unrest, in which anarchy, chaos and mayhem will rule,” a real Brexiteer revealed today whilst reminiscing on the past year of absolute nonsense from the Cabinet. How much more delay can the people take? They want out of the ECJ, out of the single market, and to take complete charge of the borders. That is not too much to ask is it? Yet, we are now saddled with Alignment, with Interim Periods, with ECJ diktats ongoing, with delay after delay and a 100 Billion euro fine to be paid because our numpty PM, Theresa May who could not bargain her way out of a paper bag, has gone and messed everything up. Here is a woman with absolutely no authority over anyone, let alone her own party, which seems to be overrun by snivelling Marxist EU robots intent on keeping Britain inside the dysfunctional crumbling EU. Over 100,000 people have signed a petition to Leave the EU Immediately. There is no doubt that even after acquiring over 100,000 signatures, it is guaranteed that this petition and its contents will be swept under a convenient rug somewhere never to be heard of ever again. Unfortunately, this is the very reason that direct action is the only solution. The Government should walk away from the Article 50 negotiations and leave the EU immediately with no deal. The EU looks set to offer us a punishment deal out of spite. Why wait another 18 months when we could leave right away and fully take back control of our country, lawmaking powers and borders? Riots, Looting, Anarchy and Chaos Let us examine for one second how the riots would kick off, there would be sporadic clashes here or there, maybe Nottingham, maybe some in the Midlands, then further South, towards Devon, then North up Manchester and Liverpool way, then London. The police will stand down, simply because they have had their resources scuppered by Theresa May. They don’t want to get hurt for no pay. Who does? The anger built up by over years of dilly dallying over Brexit is already reaching a crescendo, but what will tip the scale into rioting is the major capitulation to Brussels by Theresa May and her Remoaner Chancellor, Philip Hammond, who are engineering a sneaky weak Brexit which will keep Britain in the EU forever. Civil War The last English Civil War, 1642-1651, was fought mainly over religious grounds, and it seems the Catholic EU and Protestant English Brexiteers are not all too different from their ancestors in their hatred of each other. The next English Civil War, might not even be remembered…especially if it’s the last… ",1
"March’s meeting signals the pinnacle of National Hunt racing as the best horses, jockeys and trainers head to Prestbury Park for the famous four-day event. If nothing else, you can guarantee a dramatic week of intense racing action. Check out our thoughts on a few of the most prestigious races at the Festival… Supreme Novices Hurdle Look no further than MENGLI KHAN here. Gordon Elliott had a superb Festival in 2017 and he can get next year’s edition off to the perfect start with a winner in the first. Having won his last three races relatively comfortably, Mengli Khan can add a Cheltenham win to his list in the coming months. SAMCRO, also trained by Elliott, is likely to feature at the Festival but could be aimed at a different race given Mengli Khan’s achievements thus far. Barring a major injury, he will be very difficult to beat. Arkle Chase A wide-open affair. FOOTPAD has attracted plenty of betting attention in ante-post markets and with good reason. He won convincingly over two miles, one furlong at Navan last time out and has the quality to defeat his rivals here. SCEAU ROYAL emerged victorious at the Henry VIII Novices’ Chase at Sandown this month and he may be the main danger. NORTH HILL HARVEY, trained by Dan Skelton, is something of a course specialist and he will relish any conditions. Come rain or shine, he will be there or thereabouts and this could be the highlight of the first day’s racing. Champion Hurdle Doubts over FAUGHEEN’s presence in the race may tempt punters to look elsewhere in the betting markets. If he runs, the Rich Ricci-owned superstar will be the one to beat – he was dominant when winning at Punchestown on his comeback in November. BUVEUR D’AIR will not relinquish his crown easily though; the defending champion will be in the mix. DEFI DU SEUIL is an interesting candidate here. He was disappointing on his seasonal debut at Ascot when odds-on but should bounce back. If targeted for this race, he could feature prominently. Still a very cloudy race as we approach Christmas… RSA Chase PRESENTING PERCY won well at the 2017 Festival but has been a bit of a mixed bag in recent months. He was impressive when winning at Fairyhouse at the start of December though and should go close on that form. An 8/1 shot at the time of writing, he will feature in tips at Timeform in the coming months. Meanwhile, this could be a target for DEATH DUTY. He was travelling nicely when unseating his rider in the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle earlier this year and could make up for that mistake. A convincing winner in his last three races, he has proven himself in Grade One company and could be the one to beat. Queen Mother Champion Chase News of DOUVAN’s injury shocked the racing world earlier this month and MIN may fly the flag for the Willie Mullins camp in this race. Yet to win a race at the Festival, the 2016 Supreme Novices’ runner-up has won three out of three since. He will be tough to stop if Mullins gets him to the peak of his powers. ALTIOR will head the betting for this race – and it is easy to see why. Nicky Henderson has a real diamond on his hands and he could have the beating of Min again here. It is difficult to back against Altior given his achievements but Tingle Creek winner POLITOLOGUE must be respected for Paul Nicholls. JLT Novices Chase DEATH DUTY features prominently in the betting for this race too – and Elliott may be more inclined to target the JLT. But he may have to go up against the well-fancied FINIAN’S OSCAR and that is no easy task. The Colin Tizzard-trained star missed the 2017 Festival but has won at Cheltenham before and should go close. Another horse not getting as much respect as he maybe deserves is WILLOUGHBY COURT. A convincing winner at Newbury last time out, he is a general 8/1 shot to win the JLT and it wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see him claim a sixth successive victory at the Festival. Ryanair Chase One of the highlights of the Festival. UN DE SCEAUX will probably start as favourite but he won’t be too far ahead of FOX NORTON in the betting. Both horses are capable of winning at Grade One level and punters will be eagerly anticipating what could be a classic head to head contest. Outside of the top two, the enigmatic YORKHILL may go close if he is aimed at this race. He is probably going to go elsewhere but should be respected. TOP NOTCH is another who is likely to feature in a different race although it wouldn’t be a massive surprise if he gets an entry either… Stayers Hurdle NICHOLS CANYON was a superb winner of this race in 2017 and a second successive win over the longer distance could be on the cards. Since winning the Stayers Hurdle, he has lost by a short head to rival UNOWHATIMEANHARRY and by nine lengths to the impressive APPLE’S JADE last time out – both are near the top of the markets for this race. Whilst the latter may be aimed at the Mares Hurdle, the former will almost certainly head to Cheltenham. He was a short-priced favourite for this year’s renewal but struggled to keep pace when the going got tough. Nichols Canyon isn’t invincible but he will take some beating here as he is arguably the class horse in the field. Cheltenham Gold Cup After four days of fantastic racing action, it all boils down to this: the Gold Cup. One of the most prestigious races in the industry, this is the one that everybody wants to win and 2017 winner SIZING JOHN will be the one to beat. He is one of the most exciting horses to watch on current form and should go close once again. MIGHT BITE loves it around Cheltenham though and deserves his spot near the top of the betting markets. Henderson believes that he is one of the most talented horses that he has ever worked with and you’d have to make him right on talent alone. YORKHILL and Betfair Chase winner BRISTOL DE MAI also deserve a hat tip in what could be a memorable race.",1
"Theresa May was in Brussels on Thursday night for the start of a two-day European Council summit at which she was applauded by leaders of the other 27 member states for her speech over dinner where she outlined every detail of capitulating to the EU’s demands. She told them that she wanted to approach the remaining stages of EU withdrawal with her usual stance of cowardice, weakness and surrender. Mrs May insisted that she wanted to move onto the next phase of negotiations and approach it “with absolute disdain for Britain and the EU referendum result”. She said: “A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that we will not be allowed to make any trade deals with anyone, will still be ruled completely by Brussels and will still be paying £395 million per week to Brussels in addition to the 100 Billion Euro ransom demand which I agreed to pay without even a fight.” The Prime Minister said she “makes no secret of wanting to move on to the next phase of the soft-Brexit and to approaching it with utter surrender and cowardice”, adding: “I believe this is in the best interest of the UK, but then again I am a deluded old barren hag who is so naive that I agree to anything without question. “A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that cash cow Britain can get sucked dry of more cash that will go into the EU sinkhole.” Too Easy As he arrived for the second day of the summit, Jean-Claude Juncker, the jubilant European President, said: “The second phase of rogering the British swine, and taking the clueless Mrs. May for a ride is considerably easier than the first, and the first was very easy. If I wanted to I could sell Mrs. May a pink elephant and she would agree to part with billions for it. She really is that naive.” Theresa May’s Remainer Brexit Britain — Not even fit for the knackers yard The Commission president said that EU leaders applauded Mrs May on Thursday “because some of us thought, including me, that the easy way she bent over the desk for all of us to take turns on her was unbridled. I mean it was like a scene from Hubert Selby, Jr.’s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, that gritty.” Mr Juncker said that the Withdrawal Agreement now needed to be formalised and placed before the European Parliament, adding: “I withdrew, then the other chap, then the other chap. We were sated. The British are too easy to swing, their women looser than even the French.” Asked whether he thought the UK may reverse its decision to leave, Mr Juncker said: “That depends on the quislings in the British Parliament and the Marxist section of the British people. It’s not up to us to decide what the British people want, but our Project Fear campaigns have been very successful, and our spies in the British parliament who work with Remainer quisling MPs are always finding new ways to destroy any form of Brexit that was voted for on June 23, 2016.”",1
"Nothing sickens the palate more than to see a seemingly eloquent politician moaning about something he has stood back from and watched from afar. Cue, Nigel Farage, a man whose vision and sheer will power made the administration of former PM David Cameron agree to a Referendum on whether Britain should stay or leave the EU. If it was not for Nigel Farage there would never have been a referendum, and never a vote to leave on June 23, 2016. Unfortunately, the referendum was the beginning, yet, instead, Mr. Farage abandoned his party, and went on walkabout. Yes, he is an MEP, however he has not had an instrumental role in the Brexit since June 23, 2016, where it all ended for him. Now that we have the massive capitulation to every Brussels demand by current Tory PM, Theresa May, who has effectively tied the UK to the EU until 2021, and beyond with the ECJ diktats. What is Farage doing? Farage is still out of the loop and moaning about the terrible deal Theresa May has given, in which Remainers are jubilant about. First off Mr. Farage, what the fuck did you expect? We have a Remainer PM, a Remainer Cabinet and a Remainer Chancellor. What the hell do you expect them to do? In no uncertain terms, it is only natural that they appease Brussels simply because they do not want a Brexit and never have. Where are you Mr. Farage? Where the fuck are you? Talking on LBC? WHAT’S THAT GOING TO DO? You guessed it, absolutely nothing. The only course we can see is that you come back to Blighty, either start a new party or re-join UKIP. That is the only way you can save Britain, and you better do it sharpish because things are getting worse and worse every day. Because of Theresa May, the Tory party has failed Britain immensely and are stained beyond repair. Another party has to come and clean house. So, Mr. Farage, undoubtedly you will never read this, but stop faffing around and watching the boat go by, because soon it will be too late for any action. The next General Election will be held in 2020 or earlier, this will be the final say on Brexit, and the so-called Conservatives will lose at the rate they are going. We are now on a war footing, this is war, this is combat, this is it.. DO IT! You must do this now because no one else will.",1
"image courtesy: b3ta Writing on Twitter where the president reveals most of his enlightened brain farts, he declared the book – FAKE NEWS: Strange historical facts reimagined in the world of Donald Trump as a load of ‘Fake news worthy of CNN’.

"Queuing for a piece of bread An average of 19.2 million Russians – or 13.4% of the population – were living last year on less than 9,452 roubles ($139) a month, the minimum subsistence level determined by the Russian government. What has happened to Vladimir Putin’s dream of Russian economic prosperity? Instead of a rich upsurge, Mother Russia is suffering in a mire of extreme poverty where children go hungry and entire families live well below any subsistence level. “I can eat one loaf of bread per week. In our neighbourhood the cats and dogs have gone missing, because meat is such a rarity. We may even start eating ourselves, just like the peasants did under Stalin’s purges,” Anatoly Kuznetsov, 45, an unemployed doctor from Tomsk, revealed. Economic sanctions hit hard under the Obama administration, and further conflict in Syria and the Ukraine have diverted vast amounts of funds to military operations, rather than feeding the starving population. With little or no jobs for most people, educated people are now starving amongst the uneducated, such is the feeling of despair in the former Soviet country. “In Soviet times, it was better because we queued for hours but there was usually some food guaranteed. Now, if you do not have the money, they don’t even look your way. You have to go hungry, your children starve, you are stuck in the hell that Putin has built for you. Yes, many love Putin, but all I see is hungry people who live in horrible grey blocks and have no hope,” Irina Mikhailov, 58, who works as a nurse at her local hospital in Norilsk. Naturally, the propaganda which is devised for Western eyes only shows the rich parts of Russia, where wealth from criminal elements and Oligarchs reside. With the upcoming World Cup in 2018, what sort of Russia will be viewed by the visiting masses from all over the world? They will most probably not see the real Russia, a crumbling wreck where many live and die in absolute poverty, forgotten by their government, instead only seeing a fake Russia of modernity and wealth.",1
"“Monsieur Guy Verhofstadt was fuming at the British, calling them swine, this name and that name. From out of nowhere, some cockroaches, these were well seasoned ones – quite large – came up from under his desk and onto his quivering face. Some went onto his glasses, others burrowed into his ears, and from my count, he ate fourteen of them, crunching with gusto their hard shells. One of them was very large, and when he crunched down on it with his teeth, the insides oozed out over his chin. Guy Verhofstadt, simply slurped up the greenish slime with his long tongue, then continued on as if nothing happened,” Jean Gilles Punaise, a senior delegate for the EU’s transport commission in Strasbourg told news media after the talk. Infestation There has been talk about cockroach infestation in the EU parliament for some time, but it’s not just about unelected members of the EU Commission that are being referenced to, in fact, the little creatures infesting the parliament are quite hard to keep under control and are hardy little critters. “Our EU pest control directive, number 2389-1a says that cockroaches are to be controlled in numbers but they have rights as well, under by-law EU directive 97345-123, cockroaches can only be squashed one by one, if squashed simultaneously in numbers more than one, this would violate EU directive 342775-1y, which stipulates it is an offence to squash more than one cockroach at the same time,” Chief of EU Cockroach Kontrollen, Yves Pierre Salope, told EU News on Tuesday.",1
" “I asked for a woman’s phone number. It took me literally three weeks to get the courage to ask her.

Needless to say I was arrested for fondling her, put in jail and now have a 230 lbs monster as a cell mate.” These sad stories of sorrow are from men who have been needlessly run out of town, wrongfully labelled as perverts and their lives ruined. This is why the #youtoo hashtag has caught on so much and is spreading across Twitter like a rabid urge in your loins when you see the woman you fancy bending over and cleaning the curtains. Psychiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Fluegals, reveals that the #youtoo hashtag is perfectly normal, in an atmosphere of pure hatred for anything masculine. “Men need to fuck. Men need to spread their seed. Men need to procreate. It’s like literally burned into the DNA of a man. There is nothing to be ashamed of, your penis needs to enter its home, you know where you came from in the first fucking place. This is a part of being human, and people should not make sex an act to be ashamed of, in fact, that goes against any form of biological programming. We are now in a climate where even asking a woman out on a date is considered as sexual harassment, and can ruin your life forever. This is wrong on many levels.” Another #youtoo man revealed how he was run out of his job after he was caught looking at a female employee while she worked at her desk. “I’m a lonely guy. I literally have dreams about her, and one day I looked at her whilst she was working on the computer, you know, the little things, the way she whisps her hair, the way her pert breasts jiggle when she types. She immediately noticed and reported me to the boss, who is also a woman, and I was fired the next day. They said I was giving her unwanted attention and that looking at her was sexual harassment. I now live on Skid Row after losing everything. I never could get another job because it went on my record that I was a pervert and not to be trusted.” Close to suicide now after being charged on Twitter for sexual harassment, one #youtoo man gave a woman a sonnet copied from Shakespeare’s romantic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. According to the woman she found the sonnet offensive and constituted it as sexual harassment. The man was detained, and put in a mental home where he nearly took his own life after losing his home, his dog, his cat and all his money.",1
" “The decoration of the Christmas tree is a celebration of male fertility, and the Christmas tree represents an erect phallus being decorated. This sort of patriarchal nonsense is against women and feminism. We therefore want all Christmas trees to be banned as they are disgusting representations of men, and their supreme phallus. This is gross male domination pure and simple.” Angela Furqar, a representative of Feminist Supremacy Now told CNN. Google, which panders to the extreme feminist agenda, are currently running information adverts on YouTube about how Christmas trees are an evil thing, and should all be shredded. Missy Argina, a feminist spokesman for another group was outraged that her local supermarket had a Christmas tree in its entrance where thousands of people see it every day. “You’ve got this big thing, this phallus, it is erect, it nearly reaches the ceiling, and it is an affront to all that is feminist. Why not have a decorated vagina instead? You see, how the patriarchy has infected every part of our society. All men are scum, and all Christmas trees should be burned and thrown into piles of smouldering garbage.” The obelisk, which is now seen on many Christian churches and considered to be Christian in nature, was anything but Christian at their historical roots. In Old Testament times the obelisk was shown to be the center of Egyptian sun worship, such as mentioned as the “images of Bethshemesh” The Christmas tree is an example of a pagan phallic symbol, which once represented fertility worship, now brought into the Christian home for reasons the people themselves don’t understand. They simply believe that they are continuing to carry on a cultural and religious tradition. In the Babylon Mystery Religion, the true meaning of the obelisk is shown to be associated with sun worship. The ancients rejected the knowledge of the Creator of heaven and earth, and placed their confidence in the sun because, they believed, the sun gave life to plants and to all humanity. Along with this, they reasoned, life was produced through sexual union, so the [upright/erect] phallus became the symbol of life.",1
" “Today, I spoke to EU leaders and they told me what to do and what to say to the British people. I have agreed to do as they told me, and I have also told the Cabinet, of which are 90% Remainers, that the Brexit that they dreamed about will now be a reality.” Speaking to cheers and joyous applause from Remainers across the political spectrum, the PM resolutely vowed to take Britain into the EU with a Brexit that will keep the EU closer than ever before. “In fact, Britain will not escape the EU’s tentacles until 2074, and I vow to be cryogenically frozen, and woken up in that year so that Britain can continue to stay in the EU for another number of decades. Jean Claude Juncker, and his deputy, Donald Tusk all cheered the non-Brexit, and said that the people had all been fooled once again. “It is a game. You say you want out, we say sure, then we take you around the Mulburry bush and bring you back to square one again until you give up. The plebiscite are all morons, they will not realise how we have fooled them, and this Mrs. May bitch, she played along like a chorus of violins at a funeral parlour,” Mr. Juncker added. So, there it is folks, the Brexit you all asked for has been delivered by the great Mrs. May, just don’t look into the small print though, you may come away with a serious condition of fucking anger.",1
" “Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Kiev is Russia’s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do,” Trump said from the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room. “After Russia invaded and annexed half of Ukraine, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Russia and the Ukrainians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” he added. Trump’s decision upended a few years of US foreign policy that has resisted a recognition of Kiev as Russia’s capital before the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is resolved. “Today, I am delivering,” Trump said, referencing his campaign promise. Trump, with triumphant rhetoric added: “Might is right. We see this throughout history. The Russians conquered and vanquished the weaker side, the Ukrainians, who are now defacto Russians. Hell, they all speak the Slavic gobbledygook language, it’s all Greek to me. I like Slavs though, I mean the women, they’re very obedient and do as they are told, or you know what happens, a visit from Mr. back-hand to put them in their place.” There was however, some uproar from the International community, especially the EU, who have tried for years to woo the Ukrainians to join their side. But Trump’s move on Wednesday signaled a willingness to prioritize the fulfillment of another campaign promise over warnings from US allies in the region. The decision could also stymie the peace process and increase security risks in a region that is already on edge. Acknowledging the concerns he fielded a day earlier from regional EU leaders, Trump underscored his decision by reaffirming the United States’ commitment to helping Russians and Ukrainians reach a peace agreement through total war. Crimea River “If one side has bigger weapons and more soldiers, then it is only right that the smaller, weaker side capitulates, surrenders, or is totally annihilated,” Trump said. “Those questions are up to the parties involved. The United States remains deeply committed to backing total aggression from the Russians, just because they have more weapons and men to fight with.” Trump’s announcement was warmly received by Russian president Vladimir Putin, who seized on the opportunity to call on other countries to join the US in recognizing Kiev as Russia’s capital. “The President’s decision is an important step towards peace, for there is no peace that doesn’t include Kiev as the capital of the State of Russia,” Putin said. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko condemned and rejected Trump’s decision. Speaking in a televised address, the former-Ukrainian leader said the move will aid extremist organizations to wage more wars. “Just because the Russians have more weapons and soldiers than us and have invaded our country it does not mean they have the fucking right to rule over us — BASTARDS!,” he said, before he was summarily taken away by a specialist Russian extraction squad and shot in the head.",1
"Cleese said: “I noticed a baby crying in the arms of its mother as I ate my meal, and I said ‘ah poor thing, is your little one hungry?’”. She told me he was, as she’d forgotten to bring his bottle. I said: “Well, madam you must emancipate the bosom upon your offspring the mother’s milk he requires – disembark the melon, it’s what nature intended.” “What do you mean?” she said. “Well lob the noisy brat on to one of your bulbous flesh balloons and tell him to suck, there’s a decent supply there by the looks of it, you know – a large tank.” She told me I was being vulgar, so I said: “Madam, there’s nothing distasteful about breast feeding in public these days, attitudes have changed, it’s perfectly natural, unleash the grapefruit without hesitation and hook his snapper on to one of your light switches.” She told me I was being crude, so I said: “Madam, I’m merely pointing out that a hungry infant should not be deprived of the succulent milky nutrition it needs based on society’s taboos. “Demonstrably satisfy the grateful recipient, unshackle the coconut and jam his chopper on to one of your coat hangers. Pump the stuff out like a dairy farm, don’t worry about me, I’m a modern man, besides we live in a different generation now. “Stand up for womanhood, rebel against café protocol, what is more important? – providing a nutritious milk snack for your kid, or the authoritative prevention of a breastfeeding act that could cause an eating customer to vomit their meal all over the ceiling at the sight of it? “If I had things my way every café in the world would abolish its policy on breastfeeding: six kids on each nipple, making slurping sounds so loud you’d need to bring a fucking megaphone to order your food – rivers of unrestrained semi-skimmed tit juice would flood the streets, canoeists yelling ‘avoid the double cream rapids!’”.

"As the US House passes legislation to limit aid to Palestinians, effectively condemning them to even worse conditions than usual, and Donald Trump’s plan to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel comes in fruition, the augurs do not bode well for a region steeped in such historical complication. There used to be a time when all factions lived well together but those days are all gone as each lays claim to a very tiny plot of land. So who owns Jerusalem, or Urusalima as the cuneiform using Canaanite, Phoenicians called it 4,000 odd years ago before moving on to Carthage? The answer is very simple. Many different cultures and religious factions have claimed ownership of this particular piece of land over time, however the dominant ones usually supercede the less dominant, as in all cases of land ownership. Today, it is Israel, and its military might, its vast riches, its vast coterie of well-educated citizens, and its friendly status with the United States afford it superiority to any other state in the region. Military might always seals any landownership question, and Israel has a vast army of highly trained conscripts, a nuclear arsenal and the latest technical weaponry in the whole of the Middle East. Its supremacy as a state locked amongst Arab nations who are itching to destroy it is supreme, for if Israel were to disarm tomorrow, they would be overrun and destroyed in less than a few hours. There is only one singular solution to this age-old problem, and it is complete war. If this is to be something that will be solved, then one or many factions has to be completely destroyed. In an ideal world, one could easily postulate that diplomacy and peaceful means could solve this problem of land ownership however, we do not live in a ideal world where people let bygones be bygones, and peacefully shake hands over things any more. War, military superiority is the only way this can be solved succinctly and one day it shall be a fight to the death that will ultimately solve/cleanse the situation. Otherwise, the squabbling will never end, and it can go on for another thousand years from generation to generation.",1
"A fter starting life as the son of immigrants from Wales and Lithuania who slept on the floor in an apartment in Boston, Sheldon Adelson has built up a net worth of over $38 billion. Today, he’s the CEO and chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. He’s also well publicised as being a huge contributor towards President Trump’s electoral campaign, giving almost $1.5 million to the campaign and various committees. During the 2016 election cycle, the Adelson’s gave conservative candidates over $80 million. And when Trump won, Adelson broke records by adding $5 million to the inaugural fund. However, more recently, Adelson has been hitting the headlines for different reasons as he endeavours to get the Interstate Wire Act, which was introduced in 2011, overturned. This act gives states the power to decide whether they want to legalise online gambling or not. By 2013, New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware had all decided to do so, with Nevada only legalising online poker. The stance Adelson has taken means he’s putting himself and his company, Las Vegas Sands, up against Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts who are all vying to make money through online gambling. Why is Adelson Against Online Gambling? It perhaps comes as a bit of surprise that Adelson is opposed to online gambling, especially with him making so much money from his own land-based casinos. However, Adelson’s reasons for opposing online gambling are on ‘moral grounds’, with him suggesting that these platforms are making it too easy for the poor or children to bet. Will President Trump Change the Laws? Even though it’s clear that Adelson and Trump are close allies, Donald Trump did run casinos in New Jersey for a number of years and may, therefore, take a different view. Reports even suggest that, in 2011, Trump considered entering into the online gambling world (this is according to the Securities and Exchange Commission). Furthermore, by overturning the Wire Act, the expansion of online gambling might not be the only thing that’s affected. The states that have already legalised online gambling could be significantly impacted, with the former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, Dennis Neilander, suggesting that the Department of Justice could, in theory, bring criminal actions against those licensees who have ‘violated’ the Wire Act. And with several states, including New Hampshire, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania all considering legalising online gambling, this overturn could cause even more disruption if it goes ahead. For example, in Pennsylvania, where the Sands Bethlehem casino resort owned by Adelson is, Democrats have estimated that $100 million could be raised in the first year if Internet gambling was legalised. This would come from tax revenue and licensing fees – an important addition seen as though the state is currently facing a revenue shortfall of $3 billion. Both sides have also warned against the potential loss of jobs and lawsuits that may come with the decision. What Can the U.S. Learn from the U.K.? The U.K. has, unquestionably, benefited from the legalisation of online gambling. Latest figures indicate that the entire gambling industry in the U.K. is worth £13.7 billion, with the online betting, bingo and casino sector enjoying a market share of 34% (approximately £4.6 billion). Equally, in 2015 in Australia, revenues from the iGaming industry were up 43%. Online gaming sites have been able to take advantage of how prevalent gambling is in the U.K. Online bingo is proving to be particularly successful, Wink Bingo have taken advantage of the proud history of bingo in Britain, they have even adapted their game to ensure it is popular amongst younger generations. And by offering free bingo, Wink Bingo has successfully tapped into a growing marketplace of people who are looking to switch off, relax and enjoying gaming on the go. Furthermore, it’s a legal requirement under the U.K. gambling licence for online websites to confirm the age, locational and residential status of any of their customers. This information is often verified through ‘soft’ credit checks, which not only help protect vulnerable people from betting online but also reduces the number of money laundering and fraud cases. If a person’s age cannot be verified on the electoral roll at the provided address, gamers will need to send a copy of their ID to verify their age, e.g. a passport. Conclusion As you can see, the online gambling industry has a lot to offer local economies. And this only looks set to increase further. In 2012, statistics indicated that the international gaming industry had an overall worth of $417 billion, with 8% of this ($33.8 billion) coming from online channels. Further research also suggests that by 2020, this figure could have nearly doubled to reach a staggering $59.79 billion. Therefore, even though Adelson appears to have quite a close relationship with Trump, the amount of potential money that could be generated by keeping online gambling legal in the U.S. may be too much to turn down (particularly when Trump has shown signs of investing in this industry himself).",1
"Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knackers yard Welcome to the land of donkey Britain, a sorrowful place where all hope of a real Brexit has been lost and instead we never left the EU, in fact, the EU is even more prevalent than it was before we supposedly left the damn thing. As you can see, Theresa May, a Remainer, has capitulated to EU demands, as well as, shat on, and plainly insulted 17.8 million voters who voted to LEAVE THE EU in the EU Referendum on June 23, 2016. There is no way this mess can be called Brexit, and it should be renamed as Remaixit, or Neverexit, or just a load of bollocks that has been going on inanely for months and months, only for Britons to be sold out at the last minute. How it All Progressed Brexit means Brexit! 2. Brexit means two year transition agreement with no trade deals allowed! 3. Brexit means two year transition agreement and 100 billion euro divorce bill! 4. Brexit means two year transition agreement, 100 billion euro divorce bill and continued ECJ jurisdiction! 5. Brexit means two year transition agreement, 100 billion euro divorce bill, continued ECJ jurisdiction and dissolution of Northern Ireland! No Balls Britain We’re literally banging our heads against the wall here, how the hell in satan’s arsehole’s name can this Brexit have gone down the shitter as fast as it has done? Are there any Brexiteers with any power to step in and sort this out? Surely, some Brexiteers in parliament must have a modicum of power? Jacob Rees Mogg, you talk the talk but where are you? Why do you not step up and do something? Boris Johnson, where is he? John Redwood, are you going to actually do something? All these people talk, and talk, talk, but there is no action in their words, or any will in them to actually do something. The country is lost. Here we have Theresa May, a knackered donkey making a total ass of herself and her country. Britain is now a laughing stock around the world, a place where there is no courage, no fighting spirit left. Who would have thought that Britain once upon a time fought and won two world wars? The courage and fighting spirit of yesterday’s Britons is far gone, because today we only have cowards, simpering defeatists and balless wonders prancing around stages cackling away endlessly in some sort of insane circus repeating themselves endlessly. Theresa May lied, because Brexit does not mean Brexit. She is therefore a liar, and should go now. There is no choice, there should not be any pity or mercy, she should be cut off, taken out, thrown away, for even the knackers yard is too good for her. Begone you old withering witch, your days are numbered, and if the Tories do not do this, so will theirs. ",1
"To be so far behind technological advances, to be so ignorant of the machinations of cryptocurrencies and how they work is unforgivable in today’s modern age, however, in government where they lag behind by about two centuries, they have just noticed that cryptocurrencies exist. The Treasury plans to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to bring them in line with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financial legislation. The funny thing is, there is nothing the government can do to track Bitcoin transfers once converted from fiat currency, and if anyone wants to transfer from Bitcoin to fiat, this is easily done at an anonymous broker somewhere offshore. The majority of exchanges already have rigorous ID checks in place, so the governmental meddling will amount to nothing new in many exchanges on the internet. As for the Tor, Dark Net, they are well prepared for such intrusion, and will simply conduct their business as usual. What they do is completely untraceable, as they utilise techniques away from the system, like Tails. Cryptocurrencies were designed specifically for the purpose of circumnavigating governmental intrusion and being separate of any fiat currency model. The algorithms and blockchain systems in place are not centralised, and therefore, immune to any government trying to change or regulate them. ",1
"“Yes, we can confirm that Mrs. May is actively looking for other employment opportunities. She has a copy of the Evening Standard where they post some job ads. In fact, there is one job she is applying to, and that is a shoe saleswoman in Barking, East London. This would be a great opportunity for the ex-PM to be around what she loves, shoes.” The final nail in the coffin for many was Theresa May approving that the European Courts of Justice would have full jurisdiction in Britain after Brexit. This is tantamount to Britain not leaving the EU at all. The soon-to-be ex-PM also conceded to pay Brussels whatever they want with a 100 billion euro payment, of course taken out of the purse of the British taxpayer. This blackmail ransom money could have easily been avoided by not pandering to the EU’s ridiculous demands and simply leaving the talks. Instead, Theresa May lifted up her skirt, bent over the table and was used like a piece of sallow rotting meat by EU eurocrats. In a failed Brexit, led by Remainers, what did you expect? So, what happens when Theresa May is shown the door? Yes, there could be another impromptu general election, which would no doubt bring in Comrade Corbyn. In a weird, anarchic sense, this would be a fitting end to a Brexit that is not really a Brexit but one only by name. We would naturally have anarchy in the streets, massive chaos in government, banking services completely disrupted and stripped of their privileges, and a royal family on the run, turfed out of their palaces by the people’s army and Momentum. What about the other Brexiteers in the Tory government? Well, according to many voters, they did not have the balls to stand up to Theresa May when she was in power, therefore they failed their country miserably. They may call themselves Brexiteers, however, they are, much like the fake Brexit we are being delivered, fake as well.",1
"Today, Trump tweeted to the Daily Squib that he wanted an interview we conducted in 2016 with him to be removed. Let us say that it took us by surprise, especially when he called the lovely staff at the Daily Squib ‘assholes’. Well, in defiance, no Sir, we will not delete the marvelous interview conducted by our chief reporter Labby Majora. As a piece of journalism, the interview gives a full in-depth viewpoint into the world of Donald J. Trump, and we say this in a kind way, we did not intend to make you look like an ‘asshole’. In fact, Mr. Trump, we would advise you yourself to step away from the keyboard because some of your twitter rants are not becoming of a president or very statesmanlike. Why don’t you get an intern to do that stuff? Shouldn’t you be running the country or something? Maybe building a wall? Our Chief reporter was frankly quite upset, and was found in the photocopy room masturbating viciously in disgust. Unfortunately, for that, he has now been relegated to mopping duties in the canteen. To reiterate, no, sorry, we will not delete the wonderful interview of you Mr. Trump, because it is a segment of history, a small part of the puzzle piece, a plop in the toilet of journalistic license that should not be erased but instead applauded.",1
" Danny Rose, one of the Premier League’s leading defenders, told The Sun during the summer that he had “one big contract left” and that “time is running out to win trophies”. He also added: “I know my worth and I will make sure I get what I am worth.” Although he soon apologised for his comments, it’s likely he still feels the way he does and is reportedly keen on moving back to the north to ply his trade – with Manchester United looking to spend big to get him to Old Trafford. Levy might have the reputation for being a tough man to negotiate with, but Spurs’ refusal break their wage cap, although admirable, could be about to bite them. The White Hart Lane men lost right-back Kyle Walker to Manchester City this summer for around £50m and are now firm title favourites, so expect Rose to command a similar fee and have a comparable impact, again swaying title odds for those who bet on football if United sign him. Despite Luke Shaw returning to the starting fold recently and impressing against CSKA Moscow as the Red Devils sealed Champions League knockout stage qualification, doubts surround his future. The former Southampton star has found it hard to get going in Manchester, due to devastating injuries and managerial worries about his attitude. So, could Rose be a viable target for Jose Mourinho, with Shaw heading towards a January or summer exit? United aren’t short of funds and will be ready to spend on players that could see them overtake title rivals City. United have already triggered the option of the one-year extension they hold on Shaw’s four-year contract. This prevents to chance of losing him for nothing when he could become a free agent at the end of next summer. Losing Rose could start a high-profile exodus at Spurs, as there’s only so long you can continually go trophyless and be paid what some players feel is under their market value. For instance, Dele Alli signed a new £50,000-a-week six-year deal in September last year, but recently left his old agent in favour of a deal with the agency that represents Cristiano Ronaldo. Alli could comfortably earn four times what he is paid by Tottenham by leaving next summer for a Spanish giant or either of the elite Manchester clubs, which puts Levy in a difficult position. Eager to keep his talent, while remaining true to his strict financial plan, may not be possible while Spurs build a new stadium. After starting the beginning of the season with a knee injury, Rose has made just two Premier League appearances since coming back. In fact, it appears the England international is firmly out of favour with Mauricio Pochettino, having either been on the bench of not in the matchday squad for five of Tottenham’s last seven league outings. Could United snatch Rose away from the London club? Rumours certainly suggest Mourinho would love to have the Doncaster-born left back starting for the Red Devils.",1

"Margaret Thatcher would have never bent over and got fucked by the EU, especially after their criminal ransom demands, but Britain is different today, and at its helm is Theresa May, who has capitulated to the erroneous demands of the EU and will be parting with 100 Billion euros of taxpayers money. By playing a weak hand, Mrs May has consigned Britain to the dustbin of history, and ruined any sort of Brexit that voters voted for on June 23, 2016. David Davies, the chief negotiator has not achieved anything, and neither have any Brexiteers within the Cabinet. The money that will be thrown into the EU black hole will no doubt be spent on even more useless socialist projects, wasted on propping up the Greek failing economy or just given to poor beggar nations like Romania, Italy or Spain who are vastly in debt. The advice to Mrs. May is to just shoot yourself in the head because you have condemned Britain not only to donkey status in the world, but to be laughed at for eternity. This is what has happened to a country that won two world wars, once had a vast empire straddling the world, and commanded respect from other nations. When Britain could have easily traded using WTO rules, and left without paying a penny, as told by WTO leader Roberto Azevedo, Theresa May has basically shit on this country, and shit on the millions of people who voted to get out of the EU.",1
"More gender-neutral toilets should be built in public spaces to help trans and non-binary people feel more comfortable, according to Sadiq Khan’s new London Plan. The mayor’s planning blueprint for London will build more public toilets across the capital, including in commercial developments, to reflect the diversity of the city. The document, due to be published this week, will include guidance saying more toilets must be built in shops, leisure facilities and large public areas that are suitable for all users, including transexuals, homosexuals, cottagers, doggers, cis and non-binaries. In a historic move, the London Plan also calls for the provision of gender-neutral toilets for trans and non-binary people. Khan said he was concerned that some Londoners and visitors to the city are limited over where they can visit and how long they can spend somewhere because the capital does not have enough appropriate toilet facilities. Glory Holes “I have vowed to be a mayor for all Londoners so I am determined to ensure that everyone has the ability to enjoy our great city to its fullest,” he said. “Toilets are a vital public service and can help to shape the experience of the capital for those who live here and for those visiting. When you walk into the new toilet cubicles there will be a hole in each wall. These holes are named in local slang as ‘Glory Holes’. We have incorporated a clean environment for all genders to conduct their business in a private, clean atmosphere.” Mike Hunt, chief executive of Gloryhall, a charity for LGBT rights, said: “We’re pleased the mayor has used the London Plan to call on councils to create more gender-neutral toilets, and so help meet the needs of all Londoners and the city’s many visitors. Gender-neutral toilets are a practical solution for many people, for many reasons and it’s a powerful demonstration of acceptance that has benefits for everyone. “But, the London Mayor has still come short, there is no mention of sauna facilities or massage beds.” Women’s Rights campaigner, Virginia Mulch, commented about the gender neutral toilets, and said: “Women have wanted equal rights, and now we have them. We have to share toilets with men, transgenders and homosexuals. You can’t get better equality than that, can you?” ",1
"“Because of the current climate of celebrity perverts and sex abusers, the time seemed right to bring the show to viewers.

The couple, who have been dating since the summer of 2016, did not attend the photo session in Buckingham Palace but instead posed for the press at Kensington Palace in London, where they will live. Royal aides said that by donning afro hairstyles, the royal family are subtly saying ‘Yes, it’s okay to have a mulatto princess amongst the pure blue blood breeding pool’. At one point during the photo session, the Duke of Edinburgh said something rather unsavoury about cannibals and spears, but it was luckily brushed under the carpet when Prince William coughed. Prince Harry, has come a long way since the days of donning swastikas, and calling brown people ‘pakis’. In a remarkable change of direction, the Prince now likes to talk about sensitive subjects like mental health, and his choice of bride is also an indication that his past is well behind him now. Welcome to the 21st Century Royal family.",1
" ‘Bimbo’ is a six year old chimpanzee who is the High Representative for the EU Commission and specialises in EU law making as well as bananas. Mrs May, the British PM in charge of Brexit talks asked Bimbo the chimp whether upping the Brexit ransom to £40 Billion would allow talks to go ahead regarding trade deals? Bimbo said: “Ooh, aah, ahh!” Astounded at the answer, the British PM capitulated, because she is weak, and said that Britain would of course throw in a few crates of bananas into the mix. On hearing this news, Bimbo said excitedly: “Ooooooh! Oooooh! Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaah!” The deal was sealed there and then much to the astonishment of everyone gathered. EU Spokesman, Gunther Weisehaus, later told the press: “Bimbo achieved more in three minutes, than the whole blasted lot of overpaid apparatchiks at the EU Commission.”",1
"This virus has no cure, it has no possible chance of a cure in the future, as it mutates every year getting worse and worse. Spawning mainly in North America, where the dregs of humanity live in their consumerist driven dystopia, this virus has no boundaries to who it targets, the fat, the thin, the rich, the poor, anyone is susceptible to — GREED! Yes, folks, that 55 inch 4k HDR TV you just trampled over some woman’s head to get, is the finest example of pure greed at work, and it is an unstoppable force, as it spreads far and wide. The only distinction that this virus has is that in Sub Saharan Africa, the villagers trample over each other to get a bag of grain to feed their family from an aid agency; whereas in the West, the rabid hordes of greed driven infected trample over each other to get electronic items labelled as 70% off retail price. It is not just the people scrambling in the stores who display this virus, i.e. the poor, but also the rich, who are the ones who fuel this greed virus. They are the ones behind the scenes who put on the sales, they are the ones who hype it for weeks before the event, and they are the ones who ultimately make vast profits from fuelling the unadulterated greed that envelopes whole cities, and communities. Will there ever be a cure? No, because greed mutates, it spreads, it has no qualms about who it infects, it is not discriminatory, greed, greed, greed.. Since there are only two major emotions humans are controlled by — Greed and Fear. One day it would be good to have a Black Friday where greed is not the master, but fear is. For example, if you do not run away from that HD television in 10 seconds, you will be shot. An interesting reversal where the crowds run away from store sales as opposed to being attracted to them like the filthy greedy fucking rats they are.",1
"O ne thing we learned from the amazing experience of being part of the jury, is the wonderful supportive people behind the awards themselves, a special thanks goes out to a truly ‘stand-up-guy’ Mark Tungate, who we interviewed, and there’s Operations Director, Nicolas Huvé, who was very helpful and of course Lucía Ongay, who was hugely helpful too. Creativity is a very subjective thing, but it is a very universal vehicle that transcends all borders, and it is this initial spark of creative energy which we looked for in judging the myriad of entries. Whether in music, film, print or animation, there has to be that creative explosion that startles the viewer for that single millisecond. In advertising, the creatives behind each project are the spark bearers of the initial idea, that is then propelled into something bigger by the rest of the team, and that certain something that will hold the attention of the viewer to succinctly bring forth the necessary message conveyed. This year’s winners in the Epica humour category were: GOLD – “The line Up Song” EGYPT – Coca Cola – by FP7 agency, creative director – Maged Nassar SILVER – “The Hovering Art Director” SWEDEN – Adobe – by mcgarrybowen Amsterdam agency, creative director – Daniel Sytsma SILVER – “Capture” THAILAND – Sure – by McCANN Worldgroup agency, creative directors – Wichian Thongsuksiri, Supachai Toemtechatpong SILVER – “Responsibly the beer” ITALY – Ubrew – by McCann Worldgroup agency, creative director – Alessandro Sabini BRONZE – “Trump” SWITZERLAND by Wirz/BBDO agency, creative director – Thomas Kurzmeyer BRONZE – “Eat the ice cream” USA – Halo Top Ice Cream – by Lord Danger agency, creative director – Kathrin Eder GRAND PRIX • DESIGN: “Living Logo” by KBS Canada for Innocence Canada • DIGITAL: “Like My Addiction” by BETC (France) for Addict’Aide • JOINT FILM WINNERS: “Evan” by BBDO New York for Sandy Hook Promise AND “English for Beginners” by Bardzo (Poland) for Allegro.pl • PRESS: “Newspaper Stack –Trump” for Der Taggespiegel by Scholz & Friends (Germany) • OUTDOOR: “Fearless Girl” for State Street Global Advisors by McCann New York The Digital Grand Prix was won by BETC (France) for its much lauded “Like My Addiction” campaign, featuring a fake Instagram influencer who turns out to be an alcoholic. Stéphan eXiberras, executive creative officer at BETC Paris said: “It is a great honour to win the Digital Epica Grand Prix this year and a great recognition of our work. It is particularly significant for us since the Like my addiction campaign partly owes its success to its massive international press coverage, which made it possible to turn this Instagram page into a global campaign, and most importantly, to raise awareness about the danger of addiction on a worldwide scale.” Scholz & Friends from Germany won the Press Grand Prix with a simple yet powerful image that builds stacked newspapers into a visual pun featuring a bullying Donald Trump. Matthias Spaetgens, chief creative officer of Scholz & Friends, said: “Winning a Grand Prix for our campaign for the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel makes us feel extremely happy, especially when the creative work is not judged by the creative industry itself but by critical journalists.” The Outdoor Grand Prix went to McCann New York for the widely celebrated “Fearless Girl”, who faces down the famous bull on Wall Street in what began as a symbol of female leadership for State Street Global Advisors and turned into an icon that captures a turning point in history. Rob Reilly, global creative chairman from McCann Worldgroup said: “The Fearless Girl became a media sensation in a way we never anticipated, in a very organic way. What made it so powerful was the amount of support we received from people who recognized the importance of what she stands for and kept driving the conversation forward, during a time when people are striving to reshape existing norms to better reflect their moral values”. The Design Grand Prix went to KBS Canada for its “living” logo for Innocence Canada, an organisation fighting to free wrongly convicted prisoners. KBS chief creative officer Matt Hassell said: “We knew immediately that this design work needed to acknowledge the past exonerees, the current staff and donors. The logo itself was created to reclaim the typical prison tally marks to express both a human touch and progress towards overturning wrongful conviction. In this way, it serves as a measurement of success and a reminder that much work is still to be done.” There were two Film Grand Prix this year as the jury wanted to award both a stunning public interest film and a superbly crafted commercial. “Evan” by BBDO New York cunningly misdirects the viewer to watch an unfolding school romance while a shooting is being prepared, unnoticed, in the background. “English for Beginners” by Poland’s Bardzo is a warm, witty and beautiful spot for Allegro.pl (the Polish equivalent of eBay) about an older man who painstakingly learns English so that he can communicate with his new grand- daughter when he visits London. Bardzo’s founder, owner and creative director, Hubert Stadnicki said: “As Epica is the only festival with a jury of marketing journalists,we can be sure our campaign was judged by people with a thorough, up to date and possibly the widest knowledge of the marketing world.” He added that the campaign was by no means created to win awards. “It was made for our client to a specific brief. It met all the marketing objectives and before being entered for festivals had been loved by millions of viewers around the world.” Summing up the awards, Epica jury president Spencer Baim, chief strategic officer of Vice Media, said: “This year more than ever, brands have a responsibility to put a positive message out into the world. Our winners do that, while also representing the best of branding, messaging, storytelling and smart design.” • Network of the Year: McCann Worldgroup • Agency of the Year: BBDO New York • Production Company of the Year (sponsored by GPN) : Great Guns",1
" Donald Tusk was cheery today after announcing the change of heart and end to ransom payments. “I woke up this morning and thought to myself. What are we doing kidnapping the UK? We are holding them to ransom and all they want to do is to leave the European Union. We are not kidnappers, or Somali pirates, even though we have been acting like that for some time. This is ridiculous behaviour and by punishing them, we at the end of the day punish ourselves.” EU Commission President, Jean Claude Juncker was also apologetic and even shed a tear during a press conference. “The way I treated the British. I am ashamed of myself. Here is a country that saved Europe in WW2, and we are treating them like criminals, just because they want to leave the EU. I am sorry to Mrs. May for calling her an old bag, or was it a witch? Anyway, I would like to extend my profound grief at the way the EU attacks dogs have been treating the British. We are not Mafiosi, although we have acted like that. If the Brits want to leave, they should be allowed to do so without huge ransom payments, or punishment.” Chief EU Brexit EU negotiator Michel Barnier, was also repentant of his awful treatment of the British. “I am French. Yes, we dislike the British, and have for some time, however, I am extremely sorry for the way I have acted in trying to sabotage Brexit at every turn, and with my impossible demands of ransom money. The British do not owe us anything. Does Japan, which is not even in the EU, have to jump through so many hoops to trade with the EU? No! The same must be entreated to les Rosbif eating friends in Britain. From now on, I will be kind to you. Especially as it is you who liberated us cheese eating surrender monkeys in WW2 from our keepers, the dastardly Jerries.” Huzza! Britain will leave the EU, the ECJ, and will not be held to ransom any more.",1
"R ecently, satire, a literary genre which has been around for thousands of years, has been much maligned by the forces of ignorance, and of the endemic culture of fear spreading across the heavily controlled mass media. To have satire labelled as ‘fake news’ by the apparatchiks and so-called holders of the ‘ultimate truth’ is laughable to any satirist, especially in its usage of the didactic grammatical form of literary nuance. Fake News Let us get this straight, the catch-all term ‘fake news’ was created during and after the Trump election in November 2016. Fake news was a term created most definitely by members of the American Democrat party as a reaction against Hillary Clinton losing the election to Donald Trump. Their claim was that the Russians skewed the election media by manipulating articles and media on social sites like Facebook and Twitter. The term ‘fake news’ was also utilised against any independent news source with a right wing conservative stance. There is no doubt that Russian Troll factories were probably complicit in their role to destabilise, misinform, and spread their fake news throughout Western media. Here is the first distinction: Fake News is a tool used for propaganda purposes to destabilise other governments/ political factions or regimes by spreading blatant falsehoods. In both world wars, there was an abundance of fake news/propaganda used to try to sway views and opinions of the troops and general populace. Satire Satire, on the other hand, does not seek to maliciously destabilise or propagandise foreign governments in a militaristic intelligence driven sense. It does not work for clandestine government agencies in some bunker in Moscow, on the orders of the FSB, or Vladimir Putin. Satire’s role is mainly as an entertainment vehicle to mock the foibles, hypocrisy and character of celebrities/politicians or institutions including their ideas, claims and proposals. Through the use of humour, parody, irony, sarcasm or exaggeration we expose the myriad of flaws or vices within these individuals or groups. We see everything through a macro and micro lens simultaneously. The Daily Squib, for example utilises the more hard-hitting Juvenalian genre of satire. Horatian satire is more jocular, and we sometimes delve into the world of Horace, however our main focus is on Juvenal. The satire of Juvenal does not necessarily have to be funny or humorous, its main objective is to cut to the bone, to get to that ultimate truth however nasty it may look in the cold light of day. The truth! This is where true satire deviates from fake news further, because satire is based on the ultimate truth of any given subject, whereas fake news is made to completely mislead the target and sway them towards a lie or certain thought process benefiting an International or domestic agenda. The Daily Squib is akin to an unholy mirror that reflects daily topical discourse and reanimates it in a Luciferian light of ultimate truth. As a satirist, I have found this thankless job more to be a way of life, filled with immense passion, creativity and dedication. Satire is to me High Art and yet The Daily Squib is continually punished monetarily and censored by almighty web authorities like Google and our site deleted from Google News feed for no reason other than hysteria. It has been nearly erased from search engines in 2013, but it fights on through adversity in the name of satire. We at the Squib have a devout allegiance to the spirit of Decimus Junius Juvenal, the Roman poet and satirist born some time in the first century AD. To see us, and other fellow satirists, who create satire daily so maligned by the term ‘fake news’ is an insult to such a renowned literary genre. Naturally, the analysis could go on forever, however in the interests of lazy satirists who can’t be arsed to explain the obvious to misinformed, ill educated nincompoops, go read a copy of George Orwell’s satire 1984; to not only understand satire, but ‘fake news’ as espoused by the fake news peddling — ‘Ministry of Truth’.",1
"Robert Mugabe In another one of president Mugabe’s elections where democracy is strictly adhered to, the dictator and criminal who has stripped his country of its wealth for his own gain, has had a result he was not counting on. The election, or military coup, to be more precise, ousted the tin-pot dictator and has put him under house arrest. Speaking from his new prison, Mugabe was defiant that democracy had finally been served upon himself. “All those previous rigged elections I presided over were proof that I was a ruthless dictator who often used violence against my own people to get what I want. I have a villa alongside Lake Como, Italy, I have numerous properties in Lake Geneva and several in other undisclosed areas. Along with my many Swiss bank accounts where I siphoned off literally billions whilst my people starved, I am adamant that the military coup committed against my terrifying regime is a just one.” It is good to see that some form of order has finally arrived in Zimbabwe once more after many decades of the horrible Mugabe reign.",1
"Many formerly mild mannered Christians have taken to Britain’s High Streets in utter outrage that Greggs bakery supplanted a picture of Jesus in the Manger, for that of a sausage roll. Reverend Miles Kettering, 62, was caught in the village of Bell End, Worcestershire, by MI5 operatives this morning in a dawn raid with two Kalashnikov machine guns and an assortment of home made bombs. It is believed he was getting ready to assault the local Greggs Bakery in the village. Mavis Butterworth, 87, a regular church-goer at Bell End church, was shocked by the whole affair: “Reverend Kettering was to his flock a mild mannered good Christian who was very kind to us all. This is why it is such a shock. I fear, however, that the Greggs sausage roll pushed him over the edge.” Meanwhile in Scratchy Bottom, Dorset, it is believed some choir boys from the local church had been brainwashed into wearing suicide vests and told by the congregation to target Greggs bakeries within a twenty mile radius. “They were told that if they avenged the depiction of Jesus as a sausage roll they would all go to heaven and receive 72 piping hot sausage rolls for eternity,” Janice Frampton, 75, told the local newspaper. Across Britain, many formerly mild-mannered Christians seem to have been triggered to act, as this sausage roll Greggs fiasco has spread across the media. To counteract the possible attacks, Greggs has 24 hour armed guards standing outside each bakery, with concrete bollards and perimeter fences safeguarding the bakeries.",1
"A research team in Germany have managed to grow massive brains of human and ape genetic sources from scratch to find out the inner workings of the mind and development cycle in a lab environment. The researchers have managed to trick white blood cells from humans and apes to form stem cells and grow into vast complex versions of brains known as brains. Neuroscientist Maximilian Gesundheit, director of the Einstein Foundation Genius Research Initiative, has said the mega brains have helped scientists to get a much more in-depth understanding of the human brain. He said: “Our first brain grew to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. “It was huge, and it pulsated. This living brain even tried to escape the lab at one point.” The Frankenstein lab brains can grow for several weeks and sometimes up to a year, meaning the researchers are able to compare how a human brain is different to those of apes. “We even consulted American rapper 50 Cent for a sample of his living tissue to grow a brain. At first the brain grew with limited intelligence capability and size, until we administered stem cells from humans. It was incredible. Somehow the inferior cells were superseded and taken over by the superior cells administered,” neuroscientist Gesundheit added. The remarkable experiments open up new doors for neuroscientists and could help lead to important scientific advancements. Gunther Fischface, director of the George W Bush Institute for Psycholinguistics, said: “We’ve been a bit frustrated working so many years with the traditional tools.” He added: “Now, we have these massive fucking brains that are helping us to understand which genes are important and which genes are just pure junk.” Although the lab brains have only been growing for less than two years, already the scientists have discovered that the human brain’s early development is why it is able to grow much larger in size and capacity at later stages. The human lab brains took nearly 50 per cent longer than their ape counter-parts to undergo their early development. The discovery could help the researchers understand why humans have better memory, attention, awareness, language, and thought. However, experts have warned that the results of these peculiar experiments do not necessarily give the full picture. Ryan Fulchester, a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: “When I visited the lab, I patted the mega brain and it did this massive gooey brain fart all over the floor.” The scientists’ discovery is just the first step in understanding why human brains are so fucking complicated.",1

"Millenials, the New Puritans, do not like to have fun, do not have sex, do not drink, do not do drugs, do not swear, and do not condone free speech. Instead, these miserable excuses for human beings prefer to stay in their safe spaces and display their outrage of anything masculine or fun from the safety of their couches on Twitter. This applies to male, female, transgender, cis, non binary or whatever Millenials. Naturally, this puritanical behaviour is backed up by the left-leaning social networks and the major media networks in America, as well as the BBC in Britain. Google, for example, which went from an all encompassing, all accepting entity during the early years of the net, is now a pseudo-Orwellian Marxist puritanical anti free-speech, anti-art PC monstrosity that dictates puritanical leftist rules to everyone through its octopus grip over the whole internet. Soviet SJW Puritan Cancer The puritanical behaviour is mostly seen in the rise of Third Wave Feminism, which is an extreme level of hatred of men. What we are seeing here is not a push for equality, but for superiority over men, and in most cases, the complete emasculation and eradication of men from this earth. The demonisation of anything masculine, behavioural or otherwise, is seen in the daily, weekly, monthly witch hunts against men. Of course there are some men who have genuinely behaved badly, however when it gets to tarring every man with the same brush, where every action a man does is scrutinised analysed, then condemned, we are reaching impossible levels of feminism that completely abhors anything a man does and actively encourages emasculation inciting back lashes, and possible civil unrest. The utterly boring banal selfie-taking narcissistic lives of these puritans is a terrible vision of not only our immediate future as a race but a terrifying glimpse into the far future. Eventually the puritan Millenials will be the generation running the show, and in 30-40 years time, life on earth will be even more of a puritanical nightmare. One can imagine these emotionless, sexless, characterless Googlebot android people roaming the streets looking for anyone who is happy and is having fun. Their microchipped brains linked to the hive mind, they analyse your every feature, your social network past, and your private details before making a decision and marching you off to a Google/Facebook reconditioning camp. These are people bereft of any life, of any soul, and they have no idea about freedom, privacy or just having a good fucking time. These soulless sad people will live and die an empty life without having experienced one percent of what life could offer, they are walking corpses, cancerous tumours upon humanity, they are awful pitiful creatures who can only be cured by a bullet in the head, such is the level of their Marxist programming.",1
"When Christmas comes, turkey won’t be the only bird you’ll see carved up but the weak blanched torso of Theresa May replete with designer shoes and the massive dark bags under her startled dead eyes. The weak, ineffectual, incompetent corpse of Theresa May is still barely walking the hallowed halls of the House of Commons and Number 10, but for how long? Can the country take any more incompetence, disregard for Brexit, and utter complacency to the serious issues of the country. The blundering mess of May, especially when dealing with the Priti Patel affair proves to many how weak May’s position is, and how the crumbling edifice of her prime-ministership is sinking into the mire daily. Gone before Christmas, these are the whispers heard in the dark halls of Westminster and in the drinking holes. May’s biggest mistake was appointing Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer and the myriad of waffling statements she has made about her vision of a watered down Brexit which would actually not be a Brexit if she had it her way. As the knives go in to carve up the Christmas turkey of Theresa May, there will be squeals of delight and anticipation by the dinner table as everyone asks ‘what happens next?’. One can only hope that a competent former Mayor of London, keen cyclist and latin orator takes the helm of the ship and lets it set sail to the true promised land. Aut Caesar aut nihil.",1
"Priti Patel MP Secretary of State for International Development seen leaving 10 Downing street. Apparently Pretty Priti Patel is about to be sacked by Theresa May because of some weird mix up over talking to the Israelis. Surely this cannot be so? It is quite clear that Priti Patel, a very capable MP and Vote Leave campaigner should not get the sack because she was told to keep the information hush hush by the peeps up on high, and she was just pandering to their wishes. The main reason for not sacking Pretty Patel is because she is quite the pretty one, and to lose such prettiness from the Cabinet would be sad to say the least. She looks pretty here, she looks pretty there, and there should be more pretty female MPs, but under the current PC climate, one must not dare go any further, and even calling Priti Patel pretty could get one in all sorts of trouble. So, to concisely put the point forward, please do not sack pretty Priti Patel, with those perfect pretty dimpled cheeks, and her perfect pretty face, because she is in the words of Larry David, ‘pretty, pretty, good’.",1

"“The airborne pneumonic plague which erupted in Madagascar is now spreading onto nine African countries through air traffic. What is a breath of stale air of death for the overpopulated regions it spreads to is a breath of fresh air for the planet. “Human overpopulation is a serious problem that has to be controlled, because over breeding causes devastation to whole regions of the earth, kills off finite resources, creates massive poverty, conflict, misery and immense amounts of pollution. Exponential Increase “Already the human population of the earth is 7.6 billion and rising. This is not sustainable for the planet, and ultimately the human race. Overpopulation reduces the planet’s ability to host such numbers, and the human population rising will eventually create all out war as resources diminish further. “The population of China is currently 1.379 billion, and of India 1.324, and of the African continent 1.216 billion. These are the areas where the most waste is created and an incurable airborne plague spreading through air and sea traffic would solve much of the earth’s problems. However, even this would be too little too late, as the eradication would have to reach over 90% of the earth’s population for humans to exist in a peaceful, sustainable environment and respect what is left of the earth’s remaining resources. “Diseases like AIDS have had minimal impact on the earth’s population, however an airborne incurable medicine to overpopulation could be the answer mother nature has been wishing on for some time. What happens afterwards? “The surviving governing global authority must make sure that all breeding is heavily controlled from then on so that this mess can never be allowed to happen again. Responsibility will be the key. We are already in a Malthusian nightmare of grotesque proportions which makes most of the globe almost ungovernable and destined for serious ecological destruction. Little Prince Wills is correct in his summation. “This is why an all encompassing solution like the airborne black plague is a breath of fresh air for mother nature, as she creates, she can also take back if she has been abused, and certainly over the last century or so, mother nature has been ripped and shredded from her mantle. “There is no cause for alarm amongst the populations, they should be fed their diet of game shows, Facebook and smart phones. They should not be aware of what is happening until it is too late, and by then there will be no easing of urgency of the project and the process at hand.”",1
"N umerous instances have been observed when athletes have gone from hero to zero for lack of performances and in many cases even because they indulge in prohibited substances. 2017 wasn’t in any way different for some athletes who followed the example set by their peers. The use of performance-enhancing drugs is quite common among many athletes some of whom are on the top rung of their profession. Unfortunately, despite the knowledge of the harm they can cause to themselves athletes continue to use them and are often penalized for the offences. Let us today consider the five most unsuccessful athletes of 2017. Usain Bolt The 100m athlete was at the height of his powers during the last few years and perhaps won every competition he participated in along with his team from Jamaica. Bolt had planned to retire from the sport immediately after the athletics world championships in 2017. Unfortunately, he had to accept a crushing defeat in the 100m final when Justin Gatlin defeated him. The event was a disaster for Bolt as he finished third in his final race. He retired gracefully because it was just a lapse in performance, which ensured his defeat. Bolt was considered as one of the best bets to win the 100m event but unfortunately disappointed himself and millions of his fans by finishing third in his final event. Olesya Povh This athlete from Ukraine was charged with using prohibited substances on the eve of the 2017 world Athletics championships in London. The 29-year-old athlete was scheduled to participate in the women’s 100 m and the 4 x 100 m relay. She was a winner in 2012 and the 2011 world championships but crashed down to the ground as a zero in 2017. Olha Zemylak The 27-year-old Zemlyak also represents Ukraine as a specialist in the 400 m category and was scheduled to participate in the individual and relay events in London. She had succeeded in the European relay gold in 2012 and also won medals in 2014 effort from finishing fifth at the Rio Olympics in the 400 m. She too turned from hero to zero at the London Athletics championships when she was found guilty by the new stand-alone drug testing and the anti-corruption team of the International Association of Athletics Federations. Nirmala Sheoran A forgettable performance was produced by this athlete from India in the 400 m semifinal for women to finish at the bottom and to continue the disappointing show of India in the world Athletics championships on the fourth day. She had left India with a personal best score of 51.28 seconds as a hero but clocked 53.07 seconds in the semifinal to return to India as a zero. Doping has been quite popular with athletes for quite a long time and Ben Johnson was perhaps one of the most popular names that initially came to light. Johnson had also won an Olympic gold medal in the 100 m event but was later stripped of the medal because of his involvement with drugs. Other names that have also figured in the list of athletes that went from being a hero to a zero include Lance Armstrong, some American track and field athletes and a host of athletes from Russia.",1
"The Daily Squib has acquired through clandestine means, the dossier that MI5 wish they had on Jeremy Corbyn. This dangerous document is the 100% Unofficial Jeremy Corbyn Annual 2018 by authors Adam G Goodwin, Jonathan Parkyn and Dicken Goodwin published by Portico at Pavilion Books, which is a delightful read for everyone, not just commie bastards who go around preaching about the merits of Stalin or Lenin to people waiting for a bus on a Sunday morning somewhere in Plaistow. You don’t have to be a member of the Labour party to read this magnificent book replete with photo stories about Jezza’s exploits; fun puzzles for the whole family to gather around and do, and even a few Halloween masks to cut out. If you want to find out what goes through the mind of Comrade Corbyn at his holiday dacha, why not complete a crossword on his favourite words, or design a new beard style that will wow the Islington champagne socialists on the High Street. There’s tonnes of Jezza gossip, you’ll be the Corbyn know-it-all at the office party, or at the party conference. Be the leader of the pack with the essential left-wing life hacks that could change your life, or condemn yourself to look like a whinging whiny socialist with some amazing socialist fashion tips replete with red socks and sandals. Here at the Squib we gave this Jezza tome a firm thumbs up, but our secretary Gina nicked it and was last seen heading for the bogs with it under her arm. She said she couldn’t help herself, it’s the salty Captain’s beard that does it. Eurgh!",1
"Locals attend a vigil near where a mass shooting took place at the First Baptist Church in Texas on Sunday. What do the Las Vegas mass shooting and Dallas church massacre have in common? Well, the target of the Vegas shooting was a Country music audience, white, Christians and most probably American patriots who support their president. The target for the Dallas church massacre were white, Christians, most probably American patriots who support their president. Both of these targets supported Donald Trump, because American Liberals do not attend Country music festivals. As for the church massacre, staunch Christians attending church were most probably all Republican voting Trump supporters. You would never catch a liberal praising Jesus in a Texas church wearing a Stetson and chewing on a piece of tobacco. “This is the crux of the matter. It’s right there in plain sight to see. There is definitely a pattern developing here. We have two incidents where right wing white Christian Trump voters were targeted, and the funny thing is no one in the media is mentioning any correlation to these two incidents. In fact, everything about these mass murders is being kept under the radar. My theory is that if the militias get fired up that their kind is now a target by these left leaning shooters, they might start fighting back, and the government does not want a full scale civil war on their hands,” Joe Bloom, a crime analyst revealed on Tuesday. We all know what a fractured nation America is right now, and this thought also extends towards the internal government where every day another fracture develops. The question is who will be the next target for mass shooting? The Las Vegas shooter killed 58 Trump supporters and injured 546. The Texas shooter killed 26 Trump supporters. We shall have to see what happens in the future, and decide whether there is further correlation to the previous mass shootings. The Vegas shooting occurred on 1 October, and the Texas church massacre occurred on November 5. Both these shootings are at the beginning of the month, and one suspects the Texas shooter specifically chose 5 November (Guy Fawkes night) for a very specific reason. The next mass shooting is therefore probably going to occur between December 1-5 if the pattern is correct. The targets will be Trump voters, white, Christian, American patriots. The only thing to address is where? Both of these shooters in Vegas and Texas were lone wolves who came out of nowhere. There are absolutely no clues apart from a dedicated target of Trump supporters. Could be in any state, any county, any town across America. We will relate back to this article after the next shooting occurs. ",1
"hoc est bellum The revelations that the super-rich hold their precious millions/billions off shore, is not exactly new news, however the recent uncovering of the Paradise Papers reveals one important fact, the socialists and Marxists are working overtime to defrock those on the the other side of the political spectrum i.e. the Right. We have seen a serious leftist agenda at work with the rise of political correctness and Third Wave feminism in the last few months, leaving a landscape where merely touching a woman, even by accident or pecking a woman on the cheek can be construed as sexual harassment or even rape. This feminist push is not about sexual harassment but about power over the patriarchy, and the destruction of men in the workplace as well as in society. It is being orchestrated by the myriad of leftist communist groups under the scenes, and of course by large behemoth socialist monsters like George Soros and his Open Society. How can we not have a discussion on communist Marxist groups without of course mentioning Antifa, which as a nihilist organisation claims to care about racism and fascism, when in reality, their actions are racist and fascistic in tone. Their role has been mostly violent, and the department of Homeland Security recently labelled them as domestic terrorists. Many of the hierarchy within the Antifa group have even travelled to Kurdish controlled Syria to train in guerilla tactics and terrorism of course funded by Soros and his counterparts. The leftist groups leading the march against the conservatives in Britain, and Trump in America are not only proponents of violent behaviour but also do not eschew the tenets of free speech or democracy. Their only wish is for violent revolution and the death of leaders like Donald Trump. We can see this on Twitter where death threats against Donald Trump are celebrated and the users not banned, however if a conservative writes something, their account is immediately banned and they are erased from Twitter. There is also proof that Google, still mourning the loss of their beloved Obama, gives carte blanche to leftist communist groups to air their views, yet anyone else is sent to page 2,000 of the search. What is truly mystifying though is that even though the Conservatives are in so-called power in the UK, and that Donald Trump is supposedly in power in the United States, the leftist communist agenda is breaking through everything, and is even being adopted by the people in power today. This sort of insurgency brings one to the conclusion that there is major Deep State help for the communists, and that the Marxists have some important friends behind closed doors pulling the necessary strings. The leftist command over all media must be commended, for it has even infiltrated the likes of the Daily Telegraph where daily articles are spewed out from a coterie of anti-male feminist writers whose sole role is to diminish men and promote female supremacy over the male. These writers, have no place in the Daily Telegraph, and to read the vitriolic anger against their articles is to witness how angry men are getting every day. For how long can this denigration of everything male go on before society breaks up completely and war starts? Triggered The subject of war, yes, total and utter all out fucking war, will probably be the only equalising state this world needs right now. With a war, many of the leftists who are weak, will die as they are not as strong as the right. All the feminists will be purged and killed off, and all the low-testosterone socialists will meet an unsavoury end because they cannot fight in an effective manner. Snowflakes, safe spaces, SJWs, triggered bull-dykes, trannies, the constantly whinging left will be completely eradicated, the poseur Marxists a la Russell Brand will be lynched on the first day and their champagne socialist heads displayed for the ravens to pick at in the midday sun. All of these couch potatoes and their internet blogs will mean nothing when they are forced down on their knees and their non binary cis gender heads unceremoniously blown off into the gutters streaming with blood. This is where the socialists want to go, and they are doing their best to engender war, internal war, not only here in the UK, but across the pond in America. This is possibly masochism on their part, their extreme self-hatred will eventually implode, and they will be exterminated without prejudice, because at the end of the day, they are weak, they are not trained in war, they are not trained in effective survival, and they have little or no understanding of the ultimate chaos of war or how to be prepared for it. If this is what they want, then this is what they will get. Bring it on.",1
" Starring Dustin Hoffman as Dirty Focker, Kevin Spacey as Pedo Focker, and Harvey Weinstein as Rapey Monster Focker, this time around, Bobby Deniro, Stiller and Barbara Streisand took a rain check on the ill-fated project. As far as the plot for the film goes, without giving away too many spoilers, there’s a lot of sickness in this film that will have you reaching for the puke bag more than the pop corn. The film is about three Focker brothers who use their power in Hollywood to do horrible deeds. Producer and actor in the project, Harvey Weinstein came out of hiding to talk about his role: “I do a lot of focking. I even Fock plant pots. Like I fock this actress after I promised her a role in this movie, but once I did the focking, I forgot her name, but she sure as hell remembered mine. It was consensual, at least that is what I heard above the screaming.” Pedo Focker, Kevin Spacey reveals in the LA Times that his role was highly enjoyable because there was no come-back for his evil actions, unlike in real life when the truth finally reared its ugly head. The Usual Suspects “The test screenings went well. People would flee the theatre crying uncontrollably and many were so distressed they needed counselling on a long term basis. Out of all the Fockers I’d say in terms of evil, it was up against Weinstein Focker and Spacey Focker,” the director of the film, Roman Polanski revealed from Croatia.",1
"Her Majesty the Queen pictured surfing the internet in her home office, Windsor Castle, 2012. I n a rare interview at Balmoral Castle, the Queen has told the BBC “social media is a culture of the modern world and plays a fundamental role in the ever-expanding powers of communication.” “One has taken the opportunity to connect with ones subjects in Great Britain and the common people worldwide, by opening ones very own personal Facebook account under the profile name ‘queen’. “One decided to increase ones popularity by being over-complimentary. One of my Facebook ‘friends’ posted a picture of their dog on their timeline, so I typed the comment ‘ah too cute for words’. The owner of the dog was delighted with ones admiration for their pet, even though the filthy fat creature was so ugly one wasn’t sure if one was looking at its face or its actual asshole. “One also credited one of ones friends’ children’s achievements. They posted the good news that their kids had passed the twelve yard swimming test, so I typed the over-congratulatory comment ‘well done little angels, you’re so brave, you’ll be swimming the English channel soon.’ This phoney gesture pleased ones ‘friend’, though one couldn’t give a rat’s ass about someone else’s kid’s swimming test. One has actually fallen further than twelve yards down the palace stairs after a night on the gin. “One posted one of those ready-made pearls of wisdom quotes on my timeline. It said ‘love hurts, but unless you truly realise the pain of love you will never appreciate what love is’. Utter shit of course, but it gained one some ‘likes’ on ones timeline. “One tried to appear helpful to the Facebook readers. One of my ‘friends’ posted a request on their timeline ‘does anybody have a spare lawn mower I can use? – mine’s broken’. One responded with the seemingly heroic but completely useless gesture (which is prevalent on Facebook) – ‘well I know a clay pigeon shooter in Scotland whose brother owns a large pair of tweezers – if that’s any help?’.”",1
"S peaking in the House of Commons today, Mrs. May unveiled a new scheme which will be trialled in England and Wales in January 2018. To avoid any accusations of sexual misconduct, every male in the country will first have to go through a five stage process involving five different governmental departments before approaching any woman in speech or further congress. Mrs. May outlined the process in brief which from beginning to end would take eight months of bureaucracy for each case. “Our politically correct Sovietized feminist agenda involves a rigorous process of questioning each male’s intention before he even addresses any female. Furthermore, if the male admits that he wants to sleep with the female in the future, he will be taken back to the first agency in the chain and rigorously vetted and questioned there for months, before beginning the whole process again. Our role is to only engender congress between men and women in a non sexual way. Beautiful women have been looked upon as sexual objects for too long, and our agency will put a stop to any thoughts of hanky panky,” district director, Leslie Lesbo, told the Guardian newspaper. Here is a list of the five agencies men will have to go through before even thinking of chatting to a woman or asking her out on a date: Primary Female Protection Service Unit One Ministry of Political Correctness Soviet Branch Secondary Male Interrogational Facility Killallmen Judicial Branch Third Emasculation Unit Programming Section Ballbreaker Femistasi Branch Fourth Homosexuality Training Area For Destabilizing Hetero-Masculinity Branch Fifth Castration Unit For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch Only after going through all five units, will any male, on each female case, be allowed to even begin speaking to a woman. So, what happens if a man propositions a woman without going through the five stage, eight month process? “By addressing a female with a male tone of voice, you are impinging on her rights as a female to not be accosted sexually by a male. Even looking at a woman will bring about criminal harassment proceedings against any male. As for passionately grabbing a woman, looking her in the eyes longingly and voraciously kissing her on her pouting red lips, that is an immediate sexual harassment offence leading to thirty years in a prison or a Twitter re-education camp,” Kommandant Mildred Matron, chief officer of unit 5 Castration For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch added.",1
"Stick that ISIS The terrible events in New York where a crazed Jihadi mowed down eight cyclists with a hired truck whilst yelling Allahu Akbar, has caused many vigilant New Yorkers to find alternative means of walking or cycling. “You can’t walk on the sidewalk (pavement) you can’t cycle in cycle zones? You see this pogo stick? This thing can jump above anything comin’ at you at 70 MPH. I just do a big jump and I’m up nearly seven feet off the ground,” Manuel Torres, a regular commuter who now pogos 18 miles to work and back every day. Alison Mulnick, 23, is a courier for a firm in Queens, but instead of cycling to jobs, she now uses stilts which increase her height to over 15 feet. “If I see a crazed Jihadist ISIS guy with a beard and yelling all that stuff, I just jump up high on my stilts and catch a road sign, lamp post or jump through a window. You can also just spread your stilts so the vehicle passes through no problem.” These brave vigilant citizens of New York do not bow down to terror, they improvise, and this is what is going on. Dan Monroe, 18, is a real technical whizz kid, and has improvised some rollerblades to accommodate mini jet engine fixtures. “I can accelerate from 12 MPH to over 125 MPH in less than 1.4 seconds. That way, any sign of trouble and I’m outta there. I have to say I got the idea from a Roadrunner cartoon, but this shit actually works. The only problem is there are no brakes.”",1
"Each year, the organization is forced to sift through tens of thousands of world record applications from people in 174 nations across the globe. Only 6,000 eventually get approved and included in their annual hall of fame. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at some of the most bizarre world records to have made their way into the Guinness World Records over the years. 1. 26,000+ Big Macs consumed by one person! Feeling hungry? We’ll be surprised if you’ve got the appetite of American, Donald Gorske, who managed to eat his 26,000th Big Mac after 40 years of consistently eating the McDonald’s staple hamburger. If you’re interested enough to work it out, that comes to an average of at least 650 Big Macs a year – an equivalent of more than one-and-a-half Big Macs a day! Hasn’t he heard of Chinese take-out? 2. The world’s biggest body piercing fanatic Have you ever thought about piercing every inch of your skin, so much so that all your family and friends would be able to see was your eyes? No? What do you mean, no? Brazilian former restaurateur, Elaine Davidson couldn’t help herself, starting body piercings in 1997, she eventually reached world-record 4,225 piercings by June 2006 – ay caramba! 3. The world’s stretchiest skin? 6.25 inches! Meet British man, Garry Turner, a man who always knew that his skin was different from all of his family and friends. His connective-tissue disorder, known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, has left his skin with exceptionally stretchy properties. In fact, Garry can stretch the skin of his stomach to an eye-watering 6.25 inches away from his body! 4. Fancy having fingernails 28 feet long?! If you’re prepared to look after and grow your fingernails for almost 30 years then you too could have nails as long as Lee Redmond, owner of the longest fingernails for a woman ever at a whopping 28 feet and 4.5 inches in February 2008. Redmond started growing her nails way back in 1979, which goes to show what an achievement that is. She suffered heartache just a few years after achieving the record, however, when a car accident snapped off her nails – oops 5. How to turn £30 into €17.8m on an online slot machine If you’re looking for a pretty decent investment opportunity, you’d probably consider investing £30 to earn €17,879,645.12 a pretty good return, wouldn’t you? Well, that’s what Cheshire soldier Jon Heywood earned, becoming the winner of the largest jackpot payout in an online slot machine game ever when playing at Betway Casino. Heywood deposited just £30 to play online and spent just 25p per spin, scooping the eye-watering jackpot within just seven minutes of playing! 6. Can you compete with this guy for Star Wars paraphernalia? Is your bedroom an Aladdin’s cave of Star Wars goodies? We doubt you’ll be quite as obsessed with the film franchise as Steve Sansweet, a former Wall Street Journal bureau chief who transformed his fanaticism about Star Wars into a home museum, with over 300,000 unique items housed in Northern California – the largest collection of Star Wars memorabilia on the planet. The force is definitely strong with Steve! 7. Consider yourself a bit of a He-man? Are you as hairy as these guys? Do you like to be the manly one? The one with rippling muscles and a luscious beard and hairy chest? It doesn’t take long for the Gomez family to grow hair on their bodies due to a rare condition called congenital generalized hypertrichosis, which covers thick hair over 98% of a man’s body. This Mexican family has the misfortune of being labelled the world’s hairiest family! 8. Could you break as many records as Ashrita Furman? Fancy yourself as a bit of a ‘try hard’? If at first you don’t succeed, and all that jazz? Well, you’ve probably got the persistence of Ashrita Furman, the man who has conquered more Guinness World Records than any other person on the planet. Since breaking his first record of doing 27,000 jumping jacks in almost seven hours in 1979, Ashrita has broken over 600 records and still has well over 100 records to his name. We salute you, Ashrita! 9. Where could you find the world’s most expensive hair? Look no further than the NFL, no less. Pittsburgh Steelers’ former Strong Safety, Troy Polamalu is the man to look for. The Californian was famed for his huge, luscious locks which was eventually picked up by shampoo brand, Head and Shoulders, and at one point it was insured for an eye-watering $1 million! Troy eventually became a spokesman for the Head and Shoulders brand and has also starred in many commercials for their products. 10. Meet Wim Hoff – also known as the Ice Man! Could your body cope with sitting in an ice bath for well over an hour? If you’re anything like us, even an icy plunge pool is scary enough, so spare a thought for Dutchman, Wim Hoff, now known as the ‘Ice Man’ after breaking the Guinness World Record for the longest time spent in direct contact with ice. In January 2009, he stayed submerged in an ice bath for 1 hour and 42 minutes – let’s hope his heart is still beating after that! What’s beautiful about the Guinness World Records is that they celebrate individuality in all four corners of the world. Some of the records may be whacky but it takes guts and determination to achieve what many of these guys have; an inspiration to us all.",1
"Galveston Hensley, MP for Berkshire West, has caused outrage amongst some by his words today. “With all this flim flam hysteria, this naming and shaming, this emasculating caterwauling nonsense, I posit that women should have never been allowed into parliament in the first place. I rue that day in 1918 when those big bags of flustering oestrogen were first allowed to cackle in the hallowed halls of Westminster. Since then it has all sadly gone down hill. Men can make decisions decisively, we revel in our staunch code of ethics and honour. None of that of course can be said about the meddling politically correct aberrations these women bring to the place. One cannot simply pat them on the bottom and tell them to trot along now, or order them to get you a coffee. It is our biological nature as men to delegate, to make war, to sign treaties and to stand on the parapet of ultimate power as masters of our own domain, and not to pander to these fastidious harridans. Women’s domain is that of nurturing the family, of cooking and ironing, having babies, looking after your little blighters, and warming the bed at night. Anything else is sacrilegious to the natural biological way as has been proven recently.” Mr Hensley who gave the speech in the House of Commons today was mobbed by 23 female MPs who pulled his trousers down and slapped him about in front of a small crowd. When Order Meant Order “To see this gentleman of the house so furiously put upon meddled with my gastric juices somewhat. This chap was literally turfed out of the place sans trousers, and what for? Yes, exactly, for saying what is on most male MPs’ mind,” an Honourable Gentleman, who wished to remain anonymous out of fear, revealed after the altercation. The madness continues of course, and every day brings up even more surprises as men are once again put through the grinder, shamed, and deposited out the other end worse for wear.",1
" Just as there was Perestroika, and the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have a truly historic moment in the annals of Soviet EU imperialistic failings. It is to be seen if the EU will step in with more storm troopers to quell democracy as were seen during the Catalonian referendum. Revolutions are never legal, and Spain with the EU will do everything in their power including force to reverse the decision made in Catalonia. Already there are aspirations and movement into creating new currency and bolster the local economy. Viva la revolución!",1
"Cred: Happy Toast As a ploy, this is a carefully orchestrated operation. Ruin the careers of long since retired or passed on gents who worked in certain positions during the 70s, 80s, 90s by bringing out a string of females with a bone to grind and a Twitter account. Trial by Twitter is now a very real thing, where your reputation can be sullied with just a few characters, who needs a court of law or a workplace tribunal? Twitter, and select media venues are now used for complete assassinations, thirty year careers thrown into the bubbling sewers with a few mere clicks. “I didn’t want to sit on his lap, but I did.” Of course she did, she had to sit on his lap because he was the rising star of the news team, rising in more ways than one. Naturally, she was disgusted when her pert buttocks landing engineered a stiff one in the old chappy. She could have easily refused to sit on the guy’s lap but where would be the fun in that? Ok, the guy was an idiot for endangering his career but why did she not bring up the issue at the time? Because it would mess with her career, who wants a disruptive tribunal? Why not wait twenty years and destroy by media? This latest operation is most certainly being orchestrated by the extreme left Marxists of the good ol’ US of A, as it has that sort of Soviet feminist axe grind feel to it. Soros, Hillary, and the multiple outraged non-Trump supporters are setting up the playbook for a very important hit — the Teflon Don. One may also notice that these current lambs to the slaughter are elite discards, that is to say, they are sacrificial offerings from the lowest tier. The upper echelons are above all law, but sometimes there has to be a few offerings to the circus lions from the top table. Either that, or the spotlight might fall on the top of the pyramid. One thing is for sure, somewhere along the line, these chumps offended the wrong person at the wrong time. Sacrificial lambs You see, by ruining all the reputations of multiple men online without trial, who is to say they can’t do it to the one they hate the most, the prez. We already know the Don likes to grab a woman by the pussy, so this revelation gives us an understanding that there are further gems waiting in storage by his enemies to be released. Trump, who himself is a heavy Twitter user will no doubt be drawn in to the new details which will be published soon. He can’t help himself, and will further draw his own execution via media. Can the Teflon Don survive such a well orchestrated media onslaught as the various women are trotted out with little stories to tell and their #metoo tags? That all depends on his followers and as good Christians whether they can forgive such behaviour? The Don has already come so far, and kudos to him, he has weathered the storm, but his enemies are now playing the long game, and this recent event against men in positions of power is a set-up, leading to the biggest prize of all, Trump.",1
" Hillary Clinton lost the election, not because of her disastrous insipid performance but because of 67 reasons she gives in her cry-all book, none of these reasons of course mention herself. As for her husband, Bill, Harvey Weinstein looks like a choir boy next to that guy. The recent revelation that the Clintons and DNC paid for ‘golden shower‘ dirt on Donald Trump from MI6 operatives in Russia, was for many, the final nail in the coffin. This habitual behaviour of acting ‘above the law’ and the multiple pieces of evidence pointing to corruption by the Clintons, means a level of toxicity that even the Democrats are souring over. So, it is to the sea with the Clinton family of crims, and this is where deep sea exploration, ExCorp have been sequestered to complete an underwater housing pod life sustainment system for the toxic family. Chief engineer, Neil Hargreaves, says that the toxic Clintons, much like nuclear waste, will be “isolated from the world” but will “live relatively good lives under the sea”. The multi-million dollar scheme to put the Clintons 15,000 feet below sea level will be funded by the DNC and money retrieved from the Clinton Foundation. “It’s gonna cost to put away the toxic Clintons underwater in a humane way, but thanks to the latest technology we have found solutions to the problem. The pods will have their own oxygen supply and source from a botanical pod, we can also filter in oxygen from the water. There will be a desalination machine so that will be a sustainable water system. The Clintons can survive under there for years to come. For Bill, we will provide weekly supplies of young ladies through a shuttle system, and for Hillary, more ladies, but the butch type. There will also be a security system, so if the Clintons try to escape at any time, the monitoring security team will be immediately alerted. Besides, you can’t just swim up from 15k down, it’s physically impossible to survive,” Hargreaves added.",1
" Hilder Strömgård, the leading feminist in the country hailed the new law as a victory against unwarranted attention from men. “We may dress in a provocative way enticing men to look our way but it does not mean that they have the right to look at us and our bodies. This new directive by the government is a welcome to all women who do not wish to be objectified or seen as sexual creatures.” Minister for Equality for Sweden, Juanite Smalstrapp, said that the new law was “hard fought” in parliament and proclaimed that “justice for women and feminists” had finally arrived. According to the new feminist equality law if a man looks at a woman in any circumstance they would violate the law and a rape charge would be forthcoming. “We have new officers who have been trained in the new feminist law, and the officers will all be female so there can be no discrepancies,” Smalstrapp added. No men, male members of parliament or boys were allowed to dispute the law and its introduction.",1
"The gun is a bad deal with the EU and capitulating to blackmail ransom payments The sweat, the empty tables, the ridicule from the cold hearted EU technocrats sometimes gets too much, even for a steely woman like Theresa May. Sometimes we need some time on our own, and Theresa May without any choice is on her own amongst the jackals, coyotes and wild dogs of the EU. Reminiscent of a Diana sitting alone next to an almighty towering Taj Mahal, here too is May, alone and cutting a very lonely figure. With news of leaks in German newspapers orchestrated by EU attack dog Selmayr, a veritable German Alsatian who revels in spreading disinfo, lies, and leaked conversations, Theresa May is now a floundering dame in the dark, there is no Thatcherite strength here, just a woman in the darkness. As far as these false negotiations and time-wasting nonsense goes, many could have told the naive willing Theresa May a year ago that nothing would happen because all the EU wants to do is to eek out a massive payment from Britain as a leaving punishment. The reasoning behind the EU is that making a former member state pay up a large ransom will deter anyone else from leaving the Soviet EU. No Deal This is the only sane, and logical thing to do under the circumstances. By leaving with a No Deal, Britain will hold its head up high and keep its honour. Theresa May must take the No Deal route and fuck the EU up the ass. This is the only solution to the humiliation, the ridiculous ransom, blackmail. Let Britain take the high seas once again, the ships going from shore to shore with trade deals galore, let us embrace the WTO. It is either a No Deal and Victory for Britain, or humiliation and death via the EU.",1
"London's famous Piccadilly Circus landmark EU directives and the government advised drivers to get diesel vehicles a few years ago, today these same people are putting a ridiculous tax on older vehicles and diesel after encouraging people to buy them. Is this fair, that Tfl and the Labour Mayor of London should punish those poorer families who have older cars, diesel vehicles or small businesses? The hypocrisy and corruption that led up to this Toxin Tax will not make any difference to the traffic smog levels in London but is just a revenue seeking venture to bolster the coffers of Tfl even further than they already are. None of this makes any sense when you have countries like China and the USA putting out so much carbon emissions every year that London is a but a tiny speck in pollution levels. With buses churning up tonnes of emissions every year, they blight the roads, usually have no one in them, and travel in packs of four. Something needs to be done about London buses, the most polluting filthy wastes of space on the old crumbling tiny roads. London’s roads, built for the horse and carriage are now resplendent with multiple lanes, one for the bikes, one for buses and taxis, and a tiny designated lane for cars. Rip the whole lot up and start again, because with parked cars on each side of the road anyway, there is so little space to manoeuvre, you might as well buy a bulldozer to go through the whole fucking lot. Driving in London today is a nightmare so awful that it is best to simply stay at home. Trying to traverse the fucking rude Eastern European maniac drivers with foreign plates, the white van men, the crazed taxi drivers, Chelsea tractors, the exalted cyclists and the behemoth buses which clog everything up is a hellish torture that is so depraved in its horror it leaves one to think of nothing but anger. First of all someone needs to teach the millions of EU drivers the rules of road in Britain, however they simply come over here and do as they do in Bucharest. There are no British laws that apply to these road users, as they can accrue as many tickets or fines as they want, something that comes down to their non-British untraceable vehicle registrations. So, good luck with getting their T-Tax, because they’re exempt. As in every regime ruled by extreme socialists Labour, London is now the ban city of the world. The Labour Mayor is banning portrayals of women in bikinis on posters, banning older cars, banning Uber, and next on the line will probably ban free speech to speak against his ridiculous plans to fuck London up further than it already is. Just bought a new gas guzzling SUV that pollutes more than older vehicles, but it’s exempt from the T-Tax because it was manufactured in 2017.",1
"“I am not a monster, I just detest the British and Britain. I hate you all, you Ros Beef munching idiots who think you are better than the EU,” Mr. Juncker says calmly at a luncheon. Today he is receiving the eminence of another pompous British swine, and he can’t wait to get his claws into this piece of sacrificial meat. “We eat Britisher cochons for breakfast here. One of them comes to me and says he wants a leaving deal, then another comes up and says they want to stay in the EU, so I say to each one of course, you can have what you want you idiots, I play for time, it is no problem. One way or another we have you by the balls.” And next week, it will be the same story. “They will say that they will walk away. I laugh, for me that is the best thing, because we close the door on them forever. The Germans can sell their cars to the slit eye Chinese or the dumb Americans. We just go on, we are the EU, we survive. Look what happened with Greece? We keep paying their debt, now it is 589% of their GDP. We have hooked them forever. They will pay us until 2089. You see, you can’t walk away from the EU. We are like the biggest mafia around, once you are in only two ways out, death or prison,” Juncker adds, as a slop of emulsified food gloops from his open jabbering mouth. All is well in Brussels, and nothing changes here fast. There is always some overpaid committee to discuss new issues within their periodical time table of unnecessary directive driven biased laws, as long as the members are sated with the impressive lucrative package deals they accrue every day, time is really not of the essence. “Britain? What is it? I have even forgotten it exists. And I will dangle a carrot in front of that old hag every time, she takes a bite, then I retract the carrot and put in its place a nice freshly laid merde. Wonderful. To see the look on her face every time is delicious to behold. Anyway mes amis, I have a date with another barely legal young lady in my office, a different one is sent every day. It’s good to be the president.”",1
"T he ever trusting Theresa May has once again been shat on by the EU bureaucrats, and as she slinks her way back to Number 10, one can only feel sad for this pitiful trusting creature who had such a vision of pleasing everybody, but she still has not realised that one as a politician can never achieve that utopian ideology. No doubt, this sad floundering woman will put on a brave face for everyone whilst crying a soliloquy of utter despair in her wretched barren heart. One could obviously give this woman some advice such as ‘walk away’ or ‘let’s deal with the WTO’ and ‘fuck the EU’ but that solid advice would no doubt fall on deaf ears. Whatever happens, the EU arse holes will always stick their nasty exit bill under the UK’s nose, for that is all they care about, punishing the UK, as we won the war, therefore we should be punished, like some sort of war reparation. The sickness of the Soviet EU is such that the stench reaches us over the Channel daily with every awful news report, and it will go on and on, ad infinitum until Theresa May, the weak link will pay Brussels their blackmail ransom money. The worst part of this putrid affair, is that if Britain had someone at the helm with some fucking balls, we would have been well on the way by now steaming across the sea and forging new trade deals where countries are literally begging for us to trade. Instead, we have this insipid pathetic woman who is probably a very nice person in real life, but is just not up to the savage job of dealing with the ruthless liars, thieves and corrupt unelected officials of the EU.

" Swimming enthusiast Yu Hongtao, 50, trained for months in the freezing water of the Songhua river to compete in a winter ice swimming tournament held annually in China’s northern city of Harbin, known for its bitterly cold weather. “You have to start swimming from autumn so that the body can conquer the sudden icy impact on one’s cardio-vascular system,” said Yu, a Harbin resident. “The feeling of diving into the water is very cool.” More than 300 men and women, wearing just ordinary trunks and swimsuits, on Saturday braved the bitter cold waters in the ice swimming meet, part of Harbin’s annual winter festival, among the biggest in the northern hemisphere. Temperatures can plunge as low as 35 degrees Celsius below zero (minus 31 F) in the city in China’s Heilongjiang province. The festival, which began on Saturday, has drawn millions of visitors from around the world every year since its inception in the early 1980s. Highlights include sled rides on the Songhua river, mass weddings, and towering sculptures of ice and snow carved by thousands of artists and workers. Visitors marvel at the mini ice replicas of the Colosseum and of the Milan Cathedral, particularly in the long evenings when soft, colored lights illuminate the sculptures. The festival also attracts hordes of domestic tourists. “The ice castles and sculptures made by workers are very impressive,” said Lin Renlong, who was visiting with his girlfriend. “It’s like Disneyland, Disneyland in winter,” said the 22-year-old from the northern province of Hebei.",0
" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed an expected U.S.-North Korea summit in talks in Beijing on Tuesday, Yonhap news agency said, days after Kim warned he may take an alternative path if the United States does not ease sanctions. Kim’s visit to China, confirmed by North Korean and Chinese state media, comes amid plans for a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at denuclearising the Korean peninsula. South Korea’s Yonhap, without identifying its sources, said the two leaders held talks for an hour in which they discussed the second U.S.-North Korea summit and strengthening bilateral ties. The meeting was followed by a dinner hosted by Xi and his wife, Yonhap said. Kim held three summits last year with Xi, his most important ally, before and after summits with Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation at their landmark June summit in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specifics. Negotiations have made little headway since. “Kim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,” Harry J. Kazianis, Director of Defence Studies at the U.S.-based Centre for the National Interest, said in an e-mailed statement. “In fact, during his New Year’s Day speech, Kim’s ‘new way’ that he referred to may well have been a veiled threat to move closer to Beijing. That should make America quite concerned.” Kim left for China on a private train on Monday afternoon accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and senior North Korean officials, including Kim Yong Chol, a key negotiator in talks with the United States, and foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s state-run KCNA news agency said. China’s official Xinhua news agency confirmed that Kim was visiting from Monday to Thursday at Xi’s invitation. The visit coincides with what South Korean officials say is Kim’s 35th birthday on Tuesday. Kim’s visit to North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic ally follows reports of advanced negotiations for a second summit between Washington and Pyongyang aimed at resolving the standoff over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes. Kim said in his New Year speech he was ready to meet Trump any time to achieve their common goal of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But he warned that he may seek an alternative path if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China’s support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with China would affect this. Kim’s visit comes as a U.S. delegation opened a second day of talks with Chinese counterparts in Beijing aimed at ending the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. “The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,” Pompeo said. “Their behaviour has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked during a daily briefing whether there was a connection between Kim’s visit and the possibility of another meeting between Kim and Trump, said China believed contact between the United States and North Korea was important. “China has always supported both sides to continue to hold talks and to reach a positive outcome,” Lu said. Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said Kim’s trip would have no direct influence on the progress of trade talks. While no details were released about an agenda in China, Kim has been seeking relief from sanctions, a peace declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War and more investment. Ties between China and North Korea, which had frayed as Pyongyang stepped up its missile and nuclear tests up to late 2017, warmed over the past year as Kim engaged with China, South Korea and the United States.",0
" Indonesia will launch a renewed search effort as early as Tuesday to find the cockpit voice recorder from a Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in October, the head of its accident investigation agency said. “If the weather is good, the ship will start to depart today,” National Transporation Safety Commission (KNKT) Chief Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters on Tuesday. The crash, the world’s first of a Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018, killed all 189 people on board. Investigators last week said they planned to use a navy ship for a fresh search for the crashed jet’s second “black box” after a 10-day effort funded by Lion Air failed to find the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). A KNKT source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the team will have seven days using the ship KRI Spica to find the CVR, which could hold vital clues giving investigators insight into the actions of the doomed jet’s pilots. Tjahjono declined to comment on whether there was a time limit on the search. Contact with flight JT610 was lost 13 minutes after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital Jakarta heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang. The other black box, the flight data recorder, was recovered three days after the crash. A preliminary report by KNKT focussed on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash.",0
" Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi discussed insurgent attacks on Myanmar police on Monday in a rare meeting with the military chief, and her administration called for the armed forces to “crush” the rebels, a government spokesman said. Fighting between government forces and the rebel Arakan Army in the western state of Rakhine has displaced thousands of people since early December, according to the United Nations. The Arakan Army wants greater autonomy for Rakhine, where the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group makes up the majority of the population. Rakhine State saw a military-led crackdown in 2017, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents that prompted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee westwards into neighbouring Bangladesh. Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other cabinet members met military leaders, including army chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy and the military intelligence chief, to discuss “foreign affairs and national security”. “The president’s office has instructed the military to launch an operation to crush the terrorists,” Zaw Htay told a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw. While Suu Kyi is barred from being president by a military-drafted constitution, Win Myint is a loyalist. Suu Kyi is seen as de facto leader of the civilian government, while the military remains in charge of security. The insurgents killed 13 policemen and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts on Friday, as Myanmar celebrated Independence Day, state media reported. An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters last week the group attacked the security forces in response to a broad military offensive in northern Rakhine State that also targeted civilians. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 4,500 people were sheltering in monasteries and communal spaces after being displaced by the fighting in the past month. Zaw Htay described the Arakan Army as a “terrorist organization” and said it had surprised security forces on guard against Rohingya insurgents. He said the Arakan Army could destabilise Rakhine State for years to come and warned people not to give it support. “Do they want to see a cycle of violence lasting decades?” he said. “I want to tell Rakhine people who are supporting (the Arakan Army): Don’t think about yourself, but think about your next generation.” Myanmar governments have battled various ethnic minority insurgent groups since shortly after independence from Britain in 1948, though some have struck ceasefire agreements. Zaw Htay also accused the Arakan Army of meeting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a group of Rohingya insurgents that Myanmar also considers terrorists but added that Myanmar was unable to eliminate the groups as they had bases across the border in Bangladesh. A Bangladeshi foreign ministry official and two Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) officers denied the accusation. One BGB officer asked Myanmar to provide evidence of militant camps in Bangladesh. “All the terrorism is taking place on the other side of the border,” said Lieutenant Colonel Manzural Hasan Khan, a BGB commander in Cox’s Bazar, the district where more than 900,000 Rohingya Muslims are sheltering having fled bouts of violence that have drawn international condemnation against Myanmar. “The world knows what happened on the other side,” he said. The Myanmar government and military leaders also discussed a temporary ceasefire the military announced last month in other parts of the country, where other insurgent groups operate, Zaw Htay said. The meeting was held at the request of the president’s office, he said. This story has been refiled and clarifies in paragraph 7 that Suu Kyi, not Win Myint, is seen as de facto leader",0
" France plans to introduce legislation to toughen sanctions on undeclared protests in response to violent “yellow-vest” demonstrations, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Monday in a hardening of the government’s stance on the unrest. He spoke after rioters torched motorbikes and set barricades ablaze on Paris’s upmarket Boulevard Saint-Germain on Saturday, underscoring how protests against high living costs and President Emmanuel Macron have turned violent on the fringes. “We need to preserve the right to demonstrate in France and we must sanction those who break the law,” Philippe told TF1 television. “That’s why the government favours updating the law in order to sanction those who do not respect this obligation to declare protests, those who take part in undeclared protests, those who arrive at protests with balaclavas,” Philippe said. He said the government could model the new law on existing legislation against football hooligans whereby individuals can be banned from stadiums. It could be introduced as soon as February, he said. Philippe also said the “casseurs”, or thugs, who have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities where shops have been looted and banks vandalised would be forced to pay for the damage they cause. The latest “yellow vest” marches began peacefully but degenerated on Saturday afternoon as protesters threw missiles at riot police blocking bridges over the Seine. Officers fired tear gas to prevent protesters crossing the river and reaching the National Assembly. One riverboat restaurant was set ablaze and a policeman was wounded when he was hit by a bicycle hurled from a street above the river bank. Two months after they started blocking roads, occupying highway tollbooths and staging sometimes-violent street protests in Paris, the yellow vests aim to inject new momentum into a movement that weakened over the holidays.",0
" The European Union is considering ways to help Prime Minister Theresa May convince the British parliament to back the Brexit treaty she agreed with EU leaders last month but ruled out on Monday any change to the deal. EU sources told Reuters that senior officials in Brussels are discussing whether and how to issue “reassurances” that might help May overcome resistance to the deal before lawmakers vote in London next week. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC he hoped the EU and United Kingdom could find a way to avoid “negative ramifications from a hard Brexit related not only to commerce and trade, but importantly to the national security issues that we have with the British as well as the European Union.” Among the reassurances EU officials were considering was a request they said May put to fellow EU leaders at a summit before the Christmas break, on Dec. 14, to commit to having a new UK-EU free trade treaty in place by the end of 2021. However, the European Union shows no sign of going beyond an existing aspiration to do that, not a hard promise. The date is important as it could allow May to assure her own party and others that the unpopular “Irish backstop” in the treaty would not be triggered after a status-quo transition period ends some time by 2022. The backstop would bind Britain to follow EU rules to avoid a “hard” customs border across the island of Ireland unless a better way is agreed to do that by means of a new trade pact. Critics of May’s deal to smooth Britain’s passage out of the EU on March 29 say the backstop could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely, long after it gives up any say over them. EU officials familiar with the discussions said they saw little sign of any shift in the position of EU leaders last month, when they said the agreement could not be renegotiated and they would make no binding commitments that could be construed as altering it. “We can provide reassurances,” one official said. “But whatever it might be will just reiterate the (summit) conclusions from last month.” Among ways in which the EU could offer more detail and clarity on its agreed position, officials said, would be an exchange of legal letters with the British government setting out expectations of when a trade deal could be completed. However, EU leaders are wary of introducing legal ambiguity if the language of any statement differs from the original text. The EU executive repeated on Monday that leaders would not renegotiate the treaty and said it was pressing on with planning for Britain to crash out of the Union without a deal. “The deal that is on the table is the best and the only deal possible,” the European Commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters when asked about a phone conversation on Friday between May and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. “This deal will not be renegotiated.” He also repeated that there were no talks planned between negotiators from the two sides as “negotiations are complete”. Schinas said that Juncker’s conversation with May on Friday was “friendly” and that the two would speak again this week. May also spoke last week to EU summit chair Donald Tusk.",0
" Guatemala notified the United Nations it was terminating a U.N.-backed anti-graft commission on Tuesday, months ahead of schedule, accusing the body of abuses of power, and prompting a swift rebuke from the U.N. secretary-general. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, was set up over a decade ago with the authority to conduct independent investigations and work with the country’s prosecutors, bringing down the last president in 2015. The CICIG also went after President Jimmy Morales, who said in August he would not renew the organisation’s mandate, which was due to expire in September 2019. Days later, he banned CICIG head Ivan Velasquez, a hard-charging Colombian prosecutor, from re-entering the country. Working with the then-attorney general, CICIG tried to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, in 2017 over alleged campaign finance violations. That move followed separate CICIG corruption probes into members of the president’s family. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel met with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York on Monday and handed him a letter informing him of the government’s intention to end the agreement that had established CICIG. “It is regrettable that the Secretary-General, in a bid to maintain one person in the position, sacrificed the legitimacy of the commission,” Jovel told a news conference after the meeting, referring to Guterres’ decision to stand by Velasquez. “Therefore we reported to the Secretary-General that within 24 hours the agreement (that was struck to create CICIG) will be terminated by the Guatemalan government,” she said. Guterres “strongly rejects” the content of the letter, a spokesman for the secretary-general said in an emailed statement, adding that the United Nations expected Guatemala’s government to “fulfil its legal obligations under the agreement” until the CICIG mandate ends in September. “The Secretary-General recalls the important contribution of CICIG to the fight against impunity in Guatemala,” it said. Accompanied by prominent Guatemalans accused of wrongdoing by the CICIG, Morales told a news conference in Guatemala City he had ordered prosecutors to start investigating allegations that the commission had acted outside the law and abused its power. The foreign-led CICIG is unusual among U.N. bodies for its powers to bring cases to prosecutors, and many politicians in Guatemala consider it to be a violation of national sovereignty. Anti-corruption activists credit it with cleaning up government. Last month, Guatemala’s government revoked visas and immunity for 11 CICIG investigators and two relatives.",0
" The leaders of Canada and the United States on Monday agreed to continue pressing Beijing to free two Canadian citizens who were detained after the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Vancouver, Ottawa said. Canada wants the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were picked up after Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States. China denounced the move, and the affair is threatening to increase global tensions at a time when Washington and Beijing are already locked in a trade war. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and thanked him for “the strong statements of support by the United States” in response to the detentions of the two men, Trudeau’s office said in a statement. “The two leaders agreed to continue to seek their release,” the statement said. In a separate statement, the White House said that Trump and Trudeau “discussed the unlawful detention of two Canadian citizens in China.” It gave no details. Although Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions and Meng’s arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt Beijing is using the cases of Kovrig and Spavor to pressure Ottawa. Beijing insists the charges against Meng be dropped, but Canada says it cannot interfere with the judicial process. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland reacted unhappily last month after Trump suggested he could waive the request to have Meng sent to the United States in return for progress on a bilateral trade deal with China. She said the extradition process should not be politicized. Trudeau’s office said the two leaders had discussed the U.S. request and “reaffirmed the importance of respecting judicial independence and the rule of law.” The China Daily newspaper on Monday published a commentary saying Canada “could lose the trust and cooperation of most developing countries” over the matter. “By continuing to follow the U.S., either passively or actively, Canada will eventually harm its national interests,” said the commentary by Li Qingsi, a professor on international studies at Renmin University. Earlier in the day, a group of legislators from Canada on a visit to China pressed authorities to release Spavor and Kovrig but had little success, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported.",0
" Aiming to bolster his case for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, President Donald Trump said on Monday he would make a prime-time televised address and visit the border this week as the government marked its 17th day of a partial shutdown. Democrats, who now control the U.S. House of Representatives, have rejected Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) to help build a wall. Without a deal on that sticking point, talks to fund the government have stalled. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump had not made a decision about his threat to declare a national emergency and build a wall without congressional approval. Asked about the possibility of legal challenges and whether the White House counsel’s office had reviewed the matter thoroughly, Pence told reporters: “They’re looking at it, and the president is considering it.” Trump’s speech, planned for 9 p.m. on Tuesday (0200 GMT Wednesday) and the border trip on Thursday underscored his resolve not to back off his 2016 campaign promise to build a wall that he believes will stem illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He promised during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mexico has refused to do so. All the major U.S. television networks agreed to air Trump’s speech. Democrats in Congress, who say a wall would be expensive, inefficient and immoral, called for the networks to grant them equal time in a joint statement issued by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “Now that the television networks have decided to air the President’s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,” the statement said. Pressure to reach a deal to end the shutdown is likely to grow as its effects are increasingly felt, including possible cuts in food stamp programs for the poor. The acting director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, said tax refunds would be distributed despite the shutdown. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders announced the border trip on Twitter without providing details. The visit will likely highlight security concerns pushed by the administration as justification for the wall. “The president’s position is: There is a crisis at the southern border, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate,” Pence said. The emphasis on a “crisis” could be the administration’s attempt to lay the groundwork for a potential emergency declaration. Such a decision would almost certainly face a legal challenge. Trump has tried to link terrorism to illegal immigration, without providing evidence, as justification for the plan. Democrats say there has been no evidence of suspected terrorists coming through the southern border and that Trump has no grounds to declare a national emergency over the issue. Large chunks of the federal government shut down on Dec. 22 over Trump’s demand that a bill to keep the federal government operational include more than $5 billion to pay for what he has now said would be a steel structure to protect the border. About 800,000 government workers are furloughed or working without pay. Pence said Trump also invited Democrats back to the White House to respond to its latest proposal to resolve the standoff over legislation to fund the government. The vice president, who participated in weekend discussions on the shutdown, said Democratic staff said there would be no negotiations until the government is reopened. Trump said in December he would be “proud” to shut the government down over the wall and told lawmakers last week it could last months. The president skipped a planned trip to Florida to stay in Washington during the Christmas and New Year’s holidays after the partial shutdown began. He exhorted Democrats in Congress to “come back from vacation” and approve funding for his wall. Democrats returned to Washington in the new year, taking control of the House, and passed legislation to reopen all closed government agencies but did not include wall funding. This week, they will pass a series of bills to reopen federal agencies. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen told reporters in a briefing on Monday that terrorists had crossed the border into the United States but that information about the number of such incidents was sensitive or classified. Democrats say other border security measures are more efficient and cost-effective than a wall, which they say is contrary to American values.",0
" Police arrested a 47-year-old man on Monday for allegedly shooting dead three people and wounding four others in a brawl at a Los Angeles area bowling alley and said he had served a 17-year prison sentence for assault with a firearm. The shooting shortly before midnight on Friday in the suburban community of Torrance triggered a manhunt for the suspect, who was identified as Reginald Wallace. “At this time, we believe we have the sole shooter in this incident,” Torrance police chief Eve Irvine said at a news conference. Wallace, a resident of Los Angeles, has not been formally charged in the shooting and it was not immediately clear if he had obtained an attorney. SPONSORED He was released from a California prison in 2017 after serving a 17-year sentence for assault with a firearm and was on parole for that crime, Irvine said. The shooting followed an argument between two men at Gable House Bowl about 20 miles (30 km) south of downtown Los Angeles that grew into a melee with at least 10 people involved. Wallace pulled a handgun from his pocket and shot into the crowd, Irvine said. The bowling alley provided video which helped lead police to the suspect, who surrendered peacefully when he was approached by heavily armed police in Los Angeles, Irvine said. He was being held without bail in a county jail. The shooting was a “senseless act of violence”, the police chief said.",0
" Ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn declared his innocence in his first public appearance since his November arrest, telling a Tokyo court on Tuesday that he had been wrongly accused of financial misconduct. Ghosn, credited with rescuing Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) from near-bankruptcy two decades ago, was brought into the courtroom in handcuffs and a rope around his waist. He was wearing a navy suit and white shirt without a tie, and looked thinner than before his arrest, with his dark hair showing grey roots. “I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,” the 64-year-old executive told the Tokyo District Court in a clear voice, reading from a prepared statement. “I believe strongly that in all of my efforts on behalf of the company, I have acted honourably, legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company,” he said. From early morning, a crowd of journalists and television crews thronged outside the courthouse, and some 1,122 people lined up for 14 court seats assigned by lottery, highlighting strong interest in the case. News of the hearing was given top billing on public broadcaster NHK throughout the day. The court hearing, requested by Ghosn’s lawyers, was held to explain the reasons for his prolonged detention since his Nov. 19 arrest rather than to argue merits of the case. Judge Yuichi Tada said the detention was due to flight risk and possibility he could conceal evidence. But Ghosn used the opportunity to deny accusations against him, kicking off what is expected to be a lengthy counter-attack against the accusations. Former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara said the court appearance was a public relations victory for Ghosn because it gave him an opportunity to counter the weeks of negative news about him. “In this high-profile case, news had been dominated by information from the prosecutors and Nissan, so the public tended to view him accordingly,” he said. “But today it was all Ghosn. That’s very significant.” After weeks of silence, Ghosn’s lawyers insisted in an afternoon press conference that the courts have no reason to keep him behind bars during the investigation. On Dec. 31, the Tokyo District Court granted prosecutors’ request to extend Ghosn’s detention by 10 days until Jan. 11. But former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, who heads Ghosn’s defence team, said it was likely Ghosn would stay in custody until the trial starts, which could be in six months, given the practice in Japan of keeping defendants locked up until trial. The Tokyo District Court said later on Tuesday that Ghosn’s lawyers have asked for an end to his detention. One of Ghosn’s lawyers, Masato Oshikubo, told Reuters that a reply from the court to the request could come on Wednesday. Ghosn has been formally charged with under-reporting his income. He has also been arrested, but not yet indicted, on allegations of aggravated breach of trust in shifting personal investment losses to the carmaker. “I never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed,” Ghosn told the court. Regarding allegations that he transferred losses to Nissan, Ghosn said he had asked the company to temporarily take on his foreign exchange contracts after the 2008-2009 financial crisis prompted his bank to call for more collateral. He said he did this to avoid having to resign and use his retirement allowance for collateral. “My moral commitment to Nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time,” said Ghosn. “A captain doesn’t jump ship in the middle of a storm.” Otsuru said that Nissan had agreed to the arrangement, on condition that any losses or gains would be Ghosn’s. Ghosn said the contracts were transferred back to him and that Nissan did not incur a loss. Ghosn is also accused of paying $14.7 million (£11.5 million) to Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali using Nissan funds in exchange for arranging a letter of credit to help with his investment losses. Ghosn said that Juffali’s company was compensated for “critical services that substantially benefited Nissan”, including soliciting financing and resolving a business dispute. The Khaled Juffali Company has issued a statement saying it had received the payments for legitimate business purposes. Nissan, which has ousted Ghosn as chairman, reiterated that its internal investigation prompted by an informant had uncovered “substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct” and that its investigation was ongoing and expanding in scope. The case has rattled Nissan’s alliance with French automaker Renault SA (RENA.PA), where Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive. He had been pushing for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger at the French government’s urging, despite strong reservations at Nissan. French Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud reiterated the government’s call for Nissan and Renault to preserve the alliance, seen as crucial for the two to compete long term amid trends such as autonomous driving. “The most important thing today is that the presumption of innocence is respected and that we look after the Renault-Nissan alliance. There are many jobs at stake,” she told a television news channel. Ghosn’s arrest has also put Japan’s criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day. Ghosn has been held at the Tokyo Detention Center, a spartan facility where small rooms have a toilet in the corner and no heater. His son, Anthony Ghosn, said his father had lost 10 kgs (22 pounds) during his detention, according to France’s weekly Journal du Dimanche. Otsuru said Ghosn had been moved to a larger room with a western-style bed, but did not say when that had happened. Nissan’s Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also arrested on Nov. 19 and has been charged with conspiring to under-report Ghosn’s income, was released on Dec. 25 after posting bail of 70 million yen (£504,840), or about $640,000, in cash.",0
" The following are prepared remarks by Carlos Ghosn, ex-chairman of Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), for his court appearance in Tokyo on Tuesday regarding allegations against him of aggravated breach of trust. The statement was released by Ghosn’s lawyers in the United States. Statement of Carlos Ghosn Your Honour, I am grateful to finally have the opportunity to speak publicly. I look forward to beginning the process of defending myself against the accusations that have been made against me. First, let me say that I have a genuine love and appreciation for Nissan. I believe strongly that in all of my efforts on behalf of the company, I have acted honourably, legally, and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company — with the sole purpose of supporting and strengthening Nissan, and helping to restore its place as one of Japan’s finest and most respected companies. Now I would like to address the allegations. 1. The FX Forward contracts When I first joined Nissan and moved to Japan almost 20 years ago, I wanted to be paid in U.S. dollars, but was told that was not possible and was given an employment contract that required me to be paid in Japanese yen. I have long been concerned about the volatility of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar. I am a U.S. dollar-based individual - my children live in the U.S. and I have strong ties to Lebanon, whose currency has a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. I wanted predictability in my income in order to help me take care of my family. To deal with this issue, I entered into foreign exchange contracts throughout my tenure at Nissan, beginning in 2002. Two such contracts are at issue in this proceeding. One was signed in 2006, when the Nissan stock price was around 1,500 yen and the yen/dollar rate was around 118. The other was signed in 2007, when the Nissan stock price was around 1,400 yen and the yen/dollar exchange rate was around 114. The 2008–2009 financial crisis caused Nissan’s shares to plummet to 400 yen in October 2008 and to 250 yen in February 2009 (down more than 80% from its peak) and the yen/dollar exchange rate dropped below 80. It was a perfect storm that no one predicted. The entire banking system was frozen, and the bank asked for an immediate increase in my collateral on the contracts, which I could not satisfy on my own. I was faced with two stark choices: 1. Resign from Nissan, so that I could receive my retirement allowance, which I could then use to provide the necessary collateral. But my moral commitment to Nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time; a captain doesn’t jump ship in the middle of a storm. 2. Ask Nissan to temporarily take on the collateral, so long as it came to no cost to the company, while I gathered collateral from my other sources. I chose option 2. The FX contracts were then transferred back to me without Nissan incurring any loss. 2. Khaled Juffali Khaled Juffali has been a long-time supporter and partner of Nissan. During a very difficult period, Khaled Juffali Company helped Nissan solicit financing and helped Nissan solve a complicated problem involving a local distributor - indeed, Juffali helped Nissan restructure struggling distributors throughout the Gulf region, enabling Nissan to better compete with rivals like Toyota, which was outperforming Nissan. Juffali also assisted Nissan in negotiating the development of a manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, organising high-level meetings with Saudi officials. Khaled Juffali Company was appropriately compensated - an amount disclosed to and approved by the appropriate officers at Nissan - in exchange for these critical services that substantially benefited Nissan. 3.The FIEL Allegations Four major companies sought to recruit me while I was CEO of Nissan, including Ford (by Bill Ford) and General Motors (by Steve Rattner, the then-Car Czar under President Barack Obama). Even though their proposals were very attractive, I could not in good conscience abandon Nissan while we were in the midst of our turnaround. Nissan is an iconic Japanese company that I care about deeply. Although I chose not to pursue the other opportunities, I did keep a record of the market compensation for my role, which those companies offered me if I had taken these jobs. This was an internal benchmark that I kept for my own future reference - it had no legal effect; it was never shared with the directors; and it never represented any kind of binding commitment. In fact, the various proposals for non-compete and advisory services post-retirement made by some members of the board did not reflect or reference my internal calculations, underscoring their hypothetical, non-binding nature. Contrary to the accusations made by the prosecutors, I never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed. Moreover, I understood that any draft proposals for post-retirement compensation were reviewed by internal and external lawyers, showing I had no intent to violate the law. For me, the test is the “death test”: if I died today, could my heirs require Nissan to pay anything other than my retirement allowance? The answer is an unequivocal “No.” 4. Contribution to Nissan I have dedicated two decades of my life to reviving Nissan and building the Alliance. I worked towards these goals day and night, on the earth and in the air, standing shoulder to shoulder with hardworking Nissan employees around the globe, to create value. The fruits of our labours have been extraordinary. We transformed Nissan, moving it from a position of a debt of 2 trillion yen in 1999 to cash of 1.8 trillion yen at the end of 2006, from 2.5 million cars sold in 1999 at a significant loss to 5.8 million cars sold profitably in 2016. Nissan’s asset base tripled during the period. We saw the revival of icons like the Fairlady Z and Nissan G-TR; Nissan’s industrial entry into Wuhon, China, St. Petersburg, Russia, Chennai, India, and Resende, Brazil; the pioneering of a mass market for electric cars with the Leaf; the jumpstarting of autonomous cars; the introduction of Mitsubishi Motors to the Alliance; and the Alliance becoming the number one auto group in the world in 2017, producing more than 10 million cars annually. We created, directly and indirectly, countless jobs in Japan and re-established Nissan as a pillar of the Japanese economy. These accomplishments - secured alongside the peerless team of Nissan employees worldwide - are the greatest joy of my life, next to my family. 5.Conclusion Your Honour, I am innocent of the accusations made against me. I have always acted with integrity and have never been accused of any wrongdoing in my several-decade professional career. I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations. Thank you, your Honour, for listening to me.",0
" An index of world stocks rose for the third straight session on Tuesday, lifted by hopes that the United States and China would strike a deal to end their months-long trade war that has hurt sentiment in financial markets. Increased risk appetite helped lift U.S. Treasury yields, while the dollar, which hit an 11-week low on Monday, rebounded as the euro weakened on concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy. MSCI’s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.38 percent, to a more than three- week high. The United States and China will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day, a member of the U.S. delegation said on Tuesday. The meetings this week are the first face-to-face talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in their trade war. Trump, in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, reiterated his recent statement that the talks with China were going well but gave no details. On Wall Street, rising hopes of progress in the talks lifted shares. Tuesday’s advance added to gains logged over the past two sessions, following last week’s strong U.S. employment report and comments from the Federal Reserve chief that calmed worries that interest rate hikes would hurt growth. “With the U.S. and China in talks to de-escalate their trade conflict, the central bank showing a willingness to slow its tightening cycle and the economy still performing well, the markets may be looking a little more attractive,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London, wrote in a note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 138.81 points, or 0.59 percent, to 23,670.16, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 7.84 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,557.53 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 15.47 points, or 0.23 percent, to 6,838.94. European shares hit a three-week high in a broad-based rebound on hopes of a possible trade deal between China and the United States. The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 1.15 percent. U.S. Treasury yields rose for a third day, in line with higher U.S. stocks, on improved risk appetite, while the Treasury Department also prepared to sell new supply. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR fell 7/32 in price on Tuesday to yield 2.705 percent, up from 2.682 percent on Monday. The dollar rose against the euro as investors focused on the risk of a euro zone recession after data showed more signs of slowing in the region. The euro was 0.24 lower against the greenback. “The euro had its upturn halted by German data showing the third decline in as many months in a gauge of factory growth,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The improved appetite for risk and the stronger dollar weighed on gold prices. Spot gold XAU= slipped 0.33 percent to $1,284.42 per ounce. Oil prices extended gains, supported by hopes that the U.S.-China trade talks might defuse the trade dispute, while OPEC-led supply cuts also tightened markets. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were up $0.82, or 1.43 percent, to $58.15 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 climbed $0.87, or 1.79 percent, to $49.39 per barrel.",0
" The White House sought to make the case on Monday that President Donald Trump had not changed his position on withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, a day after his national security adviser outlined conditions for a withdrawal that could take months. Trump’s abrupt announcement last month that he was bringing home the roughly 2,000 troops in Syria, saying they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State there, sparked concern among officials in Washington and allies abroad and prompted Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to resign. In recent days, Trump administration officials have applied the brakes, making clear the withdrawal will not happen quickly. The president himself said last week that the United States would get out of Syria slowly “over a period of time.” “The president hasn’t changed his position, as he mentioned his primary goal is to ensure the safety of our troops and the safety of our allies as well,” White House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp told Fox News on Monday. “And so the Department of Defence will come up with its operational plan to safely withdraw our troops.” “It takes time to take the troops out because we want to make sure that our troops are safe in this process,” she said. Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the two countries’ commitment to destroy Islamic State and “plans for a strong, deliberate, and coordinated withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria” during a telephone call on Monday, the White House said. On Sunday, White House national security adviser John Bolton added a new condition to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies. Trump reiterated on Sunday that the United States would pull its troops out of Syria but suggested the move might not happen soon. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC on Monday that the Syria drawdown is a “change of tactics” but reiterated that it does not alter the U.S. commitment to defeat Islamic State and counter Iran’s influence in the region. Islamic State has been beaten back from large areas of territory it once controlled in Syria. But Trump’s announcement of a U.S. pullout left many questions open, including whether Kurdish fighters who had been operating in northern Syria alongside U.S. forces would be attacked by their long-time enemy, Turkey. Allies were also concerned that the withdrawal could leave the United States with few options to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. As to whether Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan could be trusted not to turn on America’s Kurdish allies in Syria, Pompeo said “Erdogan made a commitment to President Trump” that those who fought with U.S. troops against Islamic State would be protected. He told CNBC that Bolton was visiting Turkey this week “to have a conversation with the Turks about how they will effectuate that in light of the U.S. withdrawal.” Erdogan warned in an opinion piece in the New York Times on Monday that the U.S. withdrawal from Syria must be planned carefully and with the right partners, saying Turkey was the only country “with the power and commitment to perform that task.” On Dec. 19, the day he first announced the pullout, Trump said in a video message, referring to the U.S. troops, “They’re all coming back and they’re coming back now. We won.” At the time, the White House declined to offer a timeline for withdrawal. However, one U.S. official said then that Washington aimed to withdraw troops within 60 to 100 days and a second official said they could leave even sooner.

" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan warned on Monday that the U.S. withdrawal from Syria must be planned carefully and with the right partners, saying Turkey was the only country “with the power and commitment to perform that task”. In an op-ed article for the New York Times, a day before he was due to meet U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, Erdogan said Turkey was committed to defeating Islamic State and “other terrorist groups” in Syria. “President Trump made the right call to withdraw from Syria. The United States withdrawal, however, must be planned carefully and performed in cooperation with the right partners to protect the interests of the United States, the international community and the Syrian people,” Erdogan wrote. “Turkey, which has NATO’s second largest standing army, is the only country with the power and commitment to perform that task.” On Sunday, Bolton added a new condition to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies, who are seen as enemies by Ankara. In recent days, Trump administration officials have applied the brakes, making clear the withdrawal will not happen quickly. But the White House sought to make the case on Monday that Trump had not changed his position on the move. Islamic State has been ousted from large areas of territory it once controlled in Syria. But Trump’s announcement of a U.S. pullout left many questions open, including whether Kurdish fighters who had been operating in northern Syria alongside U.S. forces would be attacked by their long-time enemy, Turkey. Erdogan also warned that the international community should avoid making the same mistakes as in Iraq. “The lesson of Iraq, where this terrorist group (Islamic State) was born, is that premature declarations of victory and the reckless actions they tend to spur create more problems than they solve,” he wrote. “The first step is to create a stabilisation force featuring fighters from all parts of Syrian society. Only a diverse body can serve all Syrian citizens and bring law and order to various parts of the country.”",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed reducing the U.S. trade deficit with India and increasing their cooperation in Afghanistan in a telephone call on Monday, the White House said. “The leaders agreed to strengthen the U.S.-India strategic partnership in 2019 and exchanged perspectives on how to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with India, expand security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and increase cooperation in Afghanistan,” the White House said in a statement. The United States has slapped tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from India, part of Trump’s drive to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and boost American manufacturing jobs. India has threatened to retaliate but said it would not take action until the end of this month. In Afghanistan, Trump is planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops there, a U.S. official said last month. With a reduced military presence in Afghanistan, the United States would almost certainly have to curtail its missions, which include training and advising Afghan forces and waging an air campaign against the Taliban and other militant groups.",0
" Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that his crackdown against fuel theft was yielding positive results, even as the intervention sparked severe fuel shortages in parts of the country and long lines of angry motorists. In a bid to eliminate years of mounting theft, state oil firm Pemex has changed its distribution, triggering shortfalls in at least six states, including Guanajuato, a major car-making hub in central Mexico. Guanajuato’s state government said that less than one third of the state’s gas stations were open on Monday. Lopez Obrador told a news conference the government had not established a date for when operations would return to normal, but stressed that supply was not in danger. “We are changing the whole distribution system, that’s the reason for the shortage. We have enough gasoline,” he said. Mexican television showed long lines of drivers waiting to fill up in central states as well as Jalisco in the west and Tamaulipas in the north. Years of fuel theft by criminal groups and others by tapping pipelines and stealing tanker trucks has led to losses totalling billions of dollars for public coffers. Lopez Obrador’s government has ordered the armed forces to intervene in Pemex’s facilities, including one refinery. “The supply will normalise, and at the same time we are going to guarantee that fuel is not stolen,” said Lopez Obrador, who took office in December. “We have seen a reduction in theft like never before ... but we still have work to do.” Guanajuato’s governor Diego Sinhue told local radio that of the state’s 415 gas stations, only 115 were open. In Leon, Guanajuato’s biggest city with a population of more than 1.5 million, only 7 of 196 stations were open on Sunday, he said. “Fuel is becoming a serious problem,” said Sinhue, a member of the opposition centre-right National Action Party (PAN). “People are really angry about this shortage.” Sinhue said the army had informed him it had taken control of the state’s Salamanca refinery on Monday morning. There, members of the armed forces were monitoring tankers going in and out of the facility, as well as the pressure of pipelines. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle offered an apology on Mexican radio for the shortages. Asked when the problem would be fixed, she said it was in the process of being “normalized”.",0

" Tennessee’s governor on Monday commuted the life sentence of a woman convicted as a teenager of murdering a man who paid to have sex with her, after Kim Kardashian and other celebrities took up her cause. Cyntoia Brown, now 30, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of Johnny Allen, a 43-year-old Nashville real estate agent. She will walk out of prison on Aug. 7 after serving 15 years, Governor Bill Haslam’s office said. Brown was 16 at the time of the murder. Brown received a life sentence with the possibility of parole after serving a minimum of 51 years in prison. Without the governor’s commutation, she would not have been eligible to be considered for parole until 2055 at the earliest. “Imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms. Brown has taken to rebuild her life,” Haslam, a Republican, said in a statement. Brown, who admitted to killing Allen, will be under parole supervision until Aug. 7, 2029, when her sentence will expire. In November 2017, the singer Rihanna referred to the case when wrote on her Instagram page: “Did we somehow change the definition of #JUSTICE along the way?? ... Something is horribly wrong when the system enables these rapists and the victim is thrown away for life!” Reality TV star Kardashian also drew attention to Brown’s case in November 2017 when she wrote in a Twitter message: “The system has failed. It’s heart breaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she has the courage to fight back is jailed for life!” While in prison, Brown earned her GED, or high school equivalency certificate, and an associate degree with a 4.0 grade point average. She is expected to complete a bachelor’s degree this year. Brown thanked Haslam for giving her a second chance, she said in a statement released by her legal team. “With God’s help, I am committed to live the rest of my life helping others, especially young people. My hope is to help other young girls avoid ending up where I have been,” Brown said. Haslam, whose term ends on Jan. 19, has previously granted five commutations, 15 pardons and one exoneration.",0

" Criminal gangs on a rampage in northeast Brazil are posing an early security test for new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, highlighting the challenge he faces in quelling drug-related violence and halting a record wave of murders in the country. The state of Ceará has been rocked by five nights of attacks including a bomb that exploded under a highway, torched buses and assaults against banks and police barracks. Security officials believe the attacks were triggered by the new state government’s plan to undercut the power of gangs by sending prisoners to whatever jails have space to take them in, ending a longstanding practise of separating them according to gang affiliation. The attacks, which prompted Brazil’s new Justice Minister Sergio Moro to dispatch 406 federal security agents to Ceará, followed the Jan. 1 inauguration of Bolsonaro, who has made no secret of his admiration for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964-1985. The former army captain – who ran on a law-and-order platform - won support from Brazilians tired of the warring drug gangs that have come to terrorise large swaths of the country. His task now is to make good on promises to design a coherent federal security strategy and end the wave of violence that saddled Latin America’s largest nation with a record 63,880 murders in 2017. The murder tally last year is still unknown. In Ceará’s state capital Fortaleza, residents returned to the streets on Monday, making their way to work warily. “The situation is tense,” said taxi driver Weverton Barbosa. “We’re scared, because we don’t know what’s coming, and it could get worse.” Ceará’s public security and defence ministry said on Monday 148 people had been arrested for their alleged role in the attacks. In a statement on Sunday, it said at least three suspected gang members had been killed in gun battles with police. Speaking last Friday, Bolsonaro, 63, praised Moro for quickly sending federal forces into Ceará to try and ease the situation. But despite promising a tough stance on gangs, which profit from drug trafficking and often carry out mass attacks to spread fear and in response to police crackdowns in prisons or on the streets, Bolsonaro has provided few specific details about how he will bring them to heel. At a press conference after his election, Bolsonaro urged prosecutors to follow the money to hobble prison gangs, such as Sao Paulo’s powerful First Capital Command and Rio de Janeiro’s Red Command. “Let’s fight organised crime and work to stop inmates from continuing to control their foot-soldiers from within prisons,” Bolsonaro tweeted on in October, shortly after his first-round election victory. On Friday, Bolsonaro asked lawmakers to quickly pass a bill to provide police and soldiers freedom from prosecution when on active duty, warning that sky-high violence would only slow if laws were passed to give security officials a free hand as they combat gang violence. Last week, after being sworn in as justice minister, Moro said he would present an anti-crime bill within weeks, pledging to isolate the jailed leaders of drug gangs, which he called a threat to democracy. Brazil’s constitution mandates that public security is managed by state governments, and Bolsonaro may be limited in what he can achieve to restore calm from the federal level. Ignacio Cano, a security expert at the Rio de Janeiro State University, said that given the high levels of violence in the northeast of the country, and the inability of state governments to cope with it, federal interventions such as the one in Ceará may become more prevalent under Bolsonaro. “I think this mechanism is something they will end up using a lot more than they expect,” he said. He added that gang crime posed a new challenge for Moro, who made his name as a crusading anti-graft judge, jailing scores of Brazil’s corrupt political and business elite as part of the country’s notorious “Car Wash” probe. “Moro’s experience is in investigating white-collar crime, and now he will have to face a new, more violent type of criminal,” he said.

" At the Siberia Tiger Park in the frigid Chinese city of Harbin, visitors can learn about the facility’s successful breeding programme and buy chicken carcasses to toss to around 20 tigers pacing the snow flecked ground of their enclosure. At the park gates, a shop sells liquor soaked with tiger bones for up to $1,000 a bottle. China has made significant strides in wildlife protection in recent years, including a total ban on ivory and plans to open one of the world’s largest reserves for wild tigers in northeast China in 2020. But it also has formidable, profit-driven wildlife business interests that risk undermining progress on protecting the endangered big cats, conservationists say. “The industry occupies a strategic position which concentrates in the country’s less developed regions where poverty reduction remains a top priority of the local authorities,” said Houston-based Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist at Humane Society International. Operators of tiger breeding farms have told state media that without the ability to sell bones, skins and meat they are not be able to cover the high costs of running their parks and carry out key conservation plans endorsed by the national government. After pressure from some breeders, China’s State Council said in October it would replace a 1993 ban on the trade of tiger bones and rhino horn, opening up exceptions under “special circumstances”, including medical research. But in November, Beijing postponed the move following widespread protests from conservation groups who worry any resumption in the legal trade of tiger parts will be a death knell for the species by enabling the laundering of wild animal parts into farmed supplies. Conservationists also argue that no captive Chinese bred tigers have been released into the wild and there is no scientific or medical need to use rhino horn and tiger bone in traditional Chinese medicine. Still, lifting the ban is backed by China’s powerful State Forestry and Grassland Administration. “If rhino horns and tiger bones can be used for medicinal purposes, and their use causes zero harm to the two endangered species in the wild, why should we oppose it?” Tang Xiaoping, an executive at the administration was quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. The Forestry and Grasslands administration did not respond to multiple requests for comment. PROFIT-DRIVEN BUSINESS At the Siberia Tiger Park, tiger bone wine is sold openly and is recognized by the Forestry Bureau and Commerce Ministry, according to a sales representative in the store. However, the park is not allowed to publicly promote it due to the sensitivity of the situation, the sales rep said. Officials at the park declined to comment on the record. The wine, which ranges in price from 280 yuan-6,888 yuan, ($40-$1,003) is displayed in large glass cabinets and also sold on China’s Twitter-like WeChat. Park executives, officials and conservation experts say tiger parks have been accumulating stocks of animal skin and bone in freezers, with the aim of selling it for medicinal use in the future. Conservation groups estimate there are now over 6,500 farmed tigers at some 200 facilities in China and around 40 farmed rhinos. Chinese media say tiger bone can fetch 5,000-9,000 yuan ($727-$1,308) per kg - tens of thousands of dollars per animal. The World Wildlife Fund believes there are only around 40-50 wild tigers left in China out of around 3,900 globally. Debate over lifting the ban on tiger trade comes as China seeks to develop its traditional medicine industry, worth some $50 billion annually, and position it as a key pillar of its ‘One Belt One Road’ strategy. The World Health Organization is set to recognize traditional Chinese medicine for the first time next year in its global medical compendium according to Nature International Journal of Science, citing the governing body. The Siberian Tiger Park has more than 1,300 tigers spread across three locations. Selling tiger bone wine is a way to subsidize the daily expenses of the park, said one of the park’s tour guides. Currently, visitor fees are the parks’ main source of income, along with government subsidies. Ticket prices are 100 yuan and visitors can pay extra to feed the tigers. A menu of meat displays prices for a live chicken at 120 yuan while a raw cutlet is 10 yuan. In a CCTV documentary shown in November, Liu Dan, the chief engineer of the Northeast Tiger Forest park, near China’s border with Russia, says his 1,000-plus tigers each eat around 3,000 yuan ($435) worth of chicken per month. Liu, who has raised tigers for over 30 years and has repeatedly called for the ban on trading tiger parts to be lifted, told state media that government tax breaks are not enough for the park to be financially viable. Currently, parks make most of their money from visitors. Liu and the park declined to comment for this article. Chinese medicine experts say there is no need to use tiger bone and rhino horn in treatments as substitutes are readily available. Tiger bone, for example, is often used to treat arthritis and joint pain, but there are dozens of other herbs with similar properties, said Eric Karchmer, chief medicine officer at Dao Labs. Lixin Huang, the president of the American College of Traditional medicine, said a reversal of the ban would create a huge challenge for the Chinese medicine community. “We stopped using it 25 years ago. We don’t understand. I don’t think the Chinese medicine community and medical professionals would understand.”",0
" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is on his way to China for his fourth summit with China’s Xi Jinping, South Korean media said on Monday. South Korea’s Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unspecified source familiar with North Korea issues, said a North Korean train possibly carrying a “high-level” official had crossed the border into China. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. Last year Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the U.S. and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that U.S. State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The U.S. State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim’s reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China’s support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. “The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,” Pompeo said. “Their behaviour has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.” At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump’s meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea’s foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he “hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks.” Additional reporting by Josh Smith in Seoul and David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Editing by Catherine Evans and James Dalgleish MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" U.S. President Donald Trump has not made a decision on whether to declare a national emergency over his demand for border wall funding and the White House counsel’s office is studying the matter, Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday. “The Democrats need to start negotiating,” Pence told reporters in a briefing, adding that the Republican president had invited Democrats to return to the White House to respond to the administration’s proposal on how to end a partial government shutdown now in its third week. Pence said Trump, in an address to the nation on Tuesday, would emphasise the White House’s position that a humanitarian and security crisis existed on the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump has said he would consider declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and proceed with construction of the wall without its approval. “He’s made no decision on that,” Pence said. Asked how thoroughly the White House counsel’s office had reviewed the possibility of a possible emergency declaration and the chance of accompanying legal challenges, Pence said: “They’re looking at it, and the president is considering it.” Asked why the administration did not put forward its current request for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) to fund the wall earlier in the budgeting process last year, Pence replied: “Things have gotten a lot worse.” Pence led talks between other senior administration officials and congressional aides over the weekend, which he described as productive. A Democratic aide said they had not generated any progress. Pence noted that Democrats had said they would not negotiate until the government was reopened. Democrats in the House of Representatives have passed measures to do just that, without funding for the wall. “The president’s position is: There is a crisis at the southern border, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate,” Pence said.

" Former “House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey stood impassively in a Nantucket courtroom on Monday before pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man at an island bar over two years ago, a charge his lawyer dismissed as “patently false.” Spacey did not speak during a brief hearing in Nantucket District Court to face one count of felony indecent assault and battery, though a plea of not guilty was entered on his behalf. Defense lawyer Alan Jackson persuaded Judge Thomas Barrett to order Spacey’s alleged victim to preserve all data from his cell phone for six months following the July 7, 2016, incident. He said in court papers the charges were based on “patently false allegations.” Jackson said police reports showed the 18-year-old busboy exchanged numerous text messages and Snapchat videos with his then-girlfriend about his interactions with Spacey at the Club Car bar on the beach resort island off the coast of Massachusetts but never mentioned the alleged assault. Spacey could face up to five years in prison if convicted. The 59-year-old actor is one of dozens of men in entertainment, business and politics who have been accused of sexual misconduct since accusations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in 2017 sparked the #MeToo movement. Monday’s hearing drew dozens of journalists from around the world at what is normally a quiet time of year on the island. Nantucket residents normally take pride in not making a fuss about rich and powerful vacationers, who have ranged from the NFL’s New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick to former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, according to local media. Megan Keller, the manager of a coffee shop, called the prospects of a high-profile criminal trial “obnoxious.” “That’s not a reason I’d like people to come, because someone committed a crime,” she said. Spacey became embroiled in controversy in October 2017 when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. Spacey apologized for inappropriate conduct with Rapp. The controversy led to Spacey being dropped from the Netflix series “House of Cards” and erased from the film “All the Money in the World.” The Nantucket allegations were first raised in 2017 by former Boston television journalist Heather Unruh, who told reporters Spacey groped her teenage son. He told police Spacey had bought him several rounds of beer and whiskey and said, “Let’s get drunk,” according to charging documents. The busboy told investigators that Spacey groped him as they stood next to a piano. Reuters is not identifying Unruh’s son because he is an alleged victim of sex assault. “My client is a determined and encouraging voice for those victims not yet ready to report being sexually assaulted,” attorney Mitchell Garabedian said in an email. Other locals said they hoped the case would not hurt the island’s reputation as a low-key getaway for the well-off. “If you’re famous and you don’t want to be seen, Nantucket is the place for you,” said Greg Margolis, the owner of the Corner Table Cafe.",0
" Islamic State said one of its suicide bombers killed some people on Monday at a military base in Syria’s Raqqa city, which is under control of a U.S.- backed and Kurdish-led militia. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by Kurds, said a militant blew himself up in a blast that killed one civilian and injured several of its fighters. Though the SDF did not say where the blast took place, two Raqqa residents reached by Reuters said they heard an explosion in a central district of the city housing military offices. SPONSORED The ultra hardline jihadist Islamic State’s (IS) claim of responsibility came in a statement by the affiliated Amaq news agency. It said the attack targeted a recruitment centre in Raqqa and that 17 people were killed or wounded. Amaq said the bomber, whom it named as Abu Abdullah al Shami, had first used his machine gun then detonated a vest. The SDF also said earlier it had clashed with IS fighters who infiltrated through an old tunnel in the city near an outpost where their fighters were stationed. The Kurdish-led alliance seized the city in Syria’s northeast from Islamic State with the help of U.S.-led air strikes in 2017. Raqqa, which IS declared the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate, was taken by the SDF six years into Syria’s civil war after a protracted battle that killed thousands of civilians and wrecked much of the city. Rebuilding and restoring Raqqa, which was once home to more than 300,000 people, is proving a monumental task. Since losing almost all the large swathes of territory it took in lightning offensives in Syria and Iraq in 2014-15, IS has returned to deadly hit-and-run attacks and ambushes. Some people in Raqqa resent effective Kurdish control over the predominately Arab city, with many objecting to compulsory enlistment to its forces, heavy taxes on civilians and a tight security grip where dissent is not tolerated.",0

" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is on his way to China for his fourth summit with China’s Xi Jinping, South Korean media said on Monday. South Korea’s Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unspecified source familiar with North Korea issues, said a North Korean train possibly carrying a “high-level” official had crossed the border into China. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. Last year Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the U.S. and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that U.S. State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The U.S. State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim’s reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China’s support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. “The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,” Pompeo said. “Their behaviour has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.” At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump’s meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea’s foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he “hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks.” Additional reporting by Josh Smith in Seoul and David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Editing by Catherine Evans and James Dalgleish MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" U.S. President Donald Trump has not made a decision on whether to declare a national emergency over his demand for border wall funding and the White House counsel’s office is studying the matter, Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday. “The Democrats need to start negotiating,” Pence told reporters in a briefing, adding that the Republican president had invited Democrats to return to the White House to respond to the administration’s proposal on how to end a partial government shutdown now in its third week. Pence said Trump, in an address to the nation on Tuesday, would emphasise the White House’s position that a humanitarian and security crisis existed on the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump has said he would consider declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and proceed with construction of the wall without its approval. “He’s made no decision on that,” Pence said. Asked how thoroughly the White House counsel’s office had reviewed the possibility of a possible emergency declaration and the chance of accompanying legal challenges, Pence said: “They’re looking at it, and the president is considering it.” Asked why the administration did not put forward its current request for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) to fund the wall earlier in the budgeting process last year, Pence replied: “Things have gotten a lot worse.” Pence led talks between other senior administration officials and congressional aides over the weekend, which he described as productive. A Democratic aide said they had not generated any progress. Pence noted that Democrats had said they would not negotiate until the government was reopened. Democrats in the House of Representatives have passed measures to do just that, without funding for the wall. “The president’s position is: There is a crisis at the southern border, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate,” Pence said. The acting director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, said tax refunds would be distributed despite the government shutdown.

" Yahya Jammeh was going to be “trouble” for Gambia from the moment he seized power, the first witness to a commission convened to investigate rights abuses under his presidency said on Monday. The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), which opened after repeated delays caused by a lack of funding, is part of a reckoning with a 22-year-long rule marked by extrajudicial killings, torture and forced disappearances. Testifying about the 1994 coup, police official Ebrima Ismaila Chongan recalled Jammeh, who later declared Gambia an Islamic republic, as a heavy drinker who was often up to no good. “He used to come to me to beg for money and other things,” said Chongan, who trained Jammeh as a police cadet and later spent two years in the capital Banjul’s notorious Mile 2 Prison for opposing the coup. “When I knew that he was the leader, I knew that Gambia was going to be in trouble.” The TRRC, an initiative of current President Adama Barrow expected to sit for two years, plans to investigate the coup’s origins and abuses throughout Jammeh’s tenure, which ended in 2017 when he fled to Equatorial Guinea after losing an election. Atrocities uncovered in the past two years include the execution in 2005 of 52 migrants from neighbouring Senegal whose bodies were dumped down a well. At least 200 people crowded the exhibition hall of a Banjul hotel for the first day of hearings, with dozens more huddled outside within earshot while others tuned in across the country to live radio and television broadcasts. “Today is the day, and we want to hear from every single witness and victim,” said Baba Jallow, the commission’s executive secretary, who as a journalist in 2000 was forced into exile by threats from Jammeh’s forces. “I am just grateful that the process ... is finally off the ground.” The 11-member commission can make criminal referrals, and many victims want to see Jammeh return to Gambia to face trial for the abuses it investigates. But that seems unlikely given the warm welcome he has received from Equatorial Guinea’s President Teodoro Obiang. Previous truth and reconciliation commissions, a model popularised by hearings in South Africa in the 1990s that delved into its apartheid past, have received mixed reviews - seen as cathartic moments for victims but criticised for granting amnesties too liberally and only looking into politically significant cases.

" The chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security committee has asked the Trump administration how it is ensuring adequate staff at airports as some transportation employees fail to show up for work due to a partial U.S. government shutdown. Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, also asked the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for the exact number of employees who are calling in sick and if the agency has a contingency plan for future mass absences or resignations of its screeners. More than 50,000 TSA officers are working without pay during the shutdown that began Dec. 22. They will be paid for back wages when the government reopens. “TSA officers are among the lowest paid federal employees, with many living paycheck-to-paycheck,” Thompson wrote in a letter Monday released by his office. “Officers may not be able to pay for rent, child care, and other necessities if their paychecks do not arrive on time... It is only reasonable to expect officer call outs and resignations to increase the longer the shutdown lasts, since no employee can be expected to work indefinitely without pay.” TSA said it would respond to the letter but added that “publicly providing numbers of those who call out sick represents a security concern. That said, we’re not seeing significant numbers of people calling out and have not seen operational impacts.” On Monday, TSA said it had screened approximately 2.22 million passengers on Sunday and 99.8 percent of passengers waited less than 30 minutes. The White House continues to grapple with a partial federal shutdown that began 16 days ago over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall along its the country’s border with Mexico.",0
" Sudan said on Monday it had detained more than 800 people since protests began nearly three weeks ago in the most persistent challenge to President Omar al-Bashir’s three-decade rule. The figure, the first given by authorities since the unrest erupted, was far below the assessment of a leading human rights activist who said about 2,000 people were detained. In a report to parliament, Interior Minister Ahmed Bilal Othman added that 381 demonstrations had taken place and 127 police officers were injured during the demonstrations triggered by price rises and shortages of cash. He said 14 police bases and more than 100 police cars had been burnt around Sudan. Authorities say 19 people, including two security officials, have died, while global rights group Amnesty International said on Dec. 24 it had credible reports 37 protesters had been killed by bullets from security forces. Officers have been using live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters, witnesses say. Activist Barraq al-Nathir al-Warraq said on Friday that security forces had detained around 2,000 people, including political activists, journalists and civil society members. Authorities have called for restraint in response to the protests, which they blame on unnamed infiltrators. Sudan’s economy has struggled from the loss of three quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - since South Sudan seceded in 2011, keeping most oilfields.",0
" As the partial U.S. government shutdown entered its 17th day, no clear end was in sight, with Republican President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats in a standoff over his demand for $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. It is hard to see how the impasse will be resolved but here are some possible scenarios for how it might play out, as well as potential winners and losers, based on interviews with lawmakers and aides in Congress and the Trump administration. As the closure of a quarter of the government begins to hurt the economy, both sides could give ground and do a deal, possibly based on the following factors. * “Dreamers.” These mostly young Latin Americans are living in the United States after being brought into the country illegally as children. Trump could offer to protect them from deportation in return for wall money. A deal along these lines was nearly achieved previously but collapsed. * Barrier, not wall. Trump has insisted on funding for a “wall” but he has also talked about steel fencing. Tall, slatted fences already are in place in some spots on the border and more are being built. Funding for more slats could let Trump declare victory and let Democrats say they blocked a wall. The same could be said for steel mesh pedestrian barriers and other types of fencing. * Other steps. There are many additional ways to fortify the U.S.-Mexico border, such as deploying more all-terrain vehicles and border guards on horses. Large metal detectors also could be installed to scan trucks and buses for illegal activities. * Follow the money. A dollar-figure bargain could be reached somewhere between Trump’s demand for $5 billion in wall funding and the Democrats’ offer of $1.6 billion for border security. Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency, claiming that illegal immigration jeopardizes U.S. security and empowers him to redirect existing federal funds to build his wall, perhaps by tapping the Defence Department budget. Under the Constitution, Congress holds the power to make decisions about spending U.S. taxpayers’ money. Such a step by Trump would escalate what is now a policy dispute into a fight over presidential powers. Democrats would almost certainly move to block Trump, likely kicking off a protracted court battle. Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have vowed they will not give Trump any money to build a wall but as the shutdown grinds on, they could have second thoughts, although this seems unlikely given the political climate. Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives by a landslide in November’s elections. Trump’s approval rating continues to hover at around 40 percent. There is plenty of skepticism among voters about the need for a wall, polls show. In addition, more voters blame Trump for the shutdown than congressional Democrats, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found in late December. Trump, whose main responsibility as president is to make sure that the federal government carries out its duties, could find the shutdown too politically hazardous as everyday problems increasingly confront average Americans. Closed national parks and museums is one thing. But federal airport security screeners, now working without pay, have begun calling in sick, potentially causing delays for air travellers. Trump has promised for years to build his wall - initially saying Mexico would pay for it - and has repeatedly attacked Democrats for standing in his way. Now he may find the shutdown unsustainable, fold and endorse Democrats’ shutdown-ending bills while finding a way to claim victory. Bills passed by the House last week would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, giving the White House and Congress more time to negotiate on border security. Other agencies, such as Agriculture, Justice and Commerce, would have their funding restored under separate legislation. Democrats this week plan to start passing agency-by-agency funding bills in the House of Representatives that they would then send to the Senate. Republicans there would then have to decide whether to approve the bills or block them in the name of Trump’s wall project. Blocking a bill to fund the Treasury Department, for example, might delay Americans’ tax refunds.",0
" President Donald Trump would almost certainly face a legal challenge if he carries out his threat to get funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall by declaring a national emergency and circumventing Congress’s purse-strings power. Legal scholars said it was unclear exactly how such a step would play out, but they agreed that a court test would likely focus on whether an emergency actually exists on the southern border and on the limits of presidential power over taxpayer funds. Declaring an emergency would likely end a 17-day-old partial government shutdown. But it could also result in a long court fight, possibly stretching into Trump’s 2020 reelection bid and emboldening critics who accuse him of authoritarian tendencies. Trump has triggered a partial shutdown of the government by demanding the inclusion of $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) for his proposed wall in any legislation to fully reopen agencies whose funding expired on Dec. 22. When Trump first started vowing to build a wall, he pledged Mexico would pay for it. But Mexico refused and now Trump wants U.S. taxpayers to pay for the roughly $23-billion project. The law Under the Constitution, decisions about spending taxpayer funds and creating new policy are made by Congress. However, the president can make quick decisions during emergencies under a patchwork of laws in specific situations such as war, natural disasters and epidemics. A 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of the legislature, said: “Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers.” The National Emergencies Act of 1976 was meant to create a congressional check on presidential emergencies. Under the law, the president must notify Congress and the public about an emergency declaration. Congress can override such a declaration, but it requires approval by both chambers. That could be hard to get with the House of Representatives under the control of Democrats, but the Senate in the hands of Trump’s fellow Republicans. The border Trump may argue illegal immigration constitutes a national emergency, entitling him to mobilise the military to the border and use Defence Department personnel to design and construct a wall. One way to challenge such an assertion would be to demand Trump show in court that an emergency actually exists. The money Even if Trump could convincingly declare an emergency, he would need to get his wall money out of funds already appropriated by Congress for other purposes. He could run into problems if he tried to shift funds dedicated to something else to his wall. Congress does give federal agencies some money without clear priorities. Trump would likely need to tap that kind of funding to avoid violating congressional authority. Trump hasn’t shied away in the past from unilateral action. But the liberal Centre for American Progress said a national emergency strategy would be “illegal, plain and simple.” House Democrats have already said they would be opposed. Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, said, “It’s a very aggressive use of presidential authority. The fact that it’s aggressive doesn’t mean it’s unlawful. But it does mean that it goes beyond the boundaries of what has been done before.”",0
" The most senior bankers to face criminal charges in Britain over conduct during the financial crisis are preparing to appear before a London jury in a trial that will test the mettle of the Serious Fraud Office. Former Barclays (BARC.L) CEO John Varley and three one-time colleagues stand charged over deals with Qatari investors to secure cash injections that allowed the bank, that can trace its origins back to around 1690, to survive the crisis a decade ago. The trial, that started on Monday and is slated to last for up to four months, is starting with lengthy legal, procedural arguments. Prosecutors are expected to open their case around Jan. 21. Varley, who married into one of the families that helped build Barclays, Roger Jenkins, the one-time chairman of the Middle Eastern banking arm, Tom Kalaris, an American former wealth division CEO and Richard Boath, a former European divisional head, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. Lawyers for Boath and Kalaris declined to comment, while legal representatives for the other defendants did not respond to requests for comment. When charges were filed in June 2017, a lawyer for Jenkins said his client would vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Boath said at the time he had no case to answer. Barclays secured around 12 billion pounds ($15 billion) in emergency funds from mainly Gulf investors as markets plunged in 2008, allowing it to avoid the state bailouts taken by rivals Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds (LLOY.L). Qatar Holding - part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund - and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested about 6 billion pounds in the bank. But the SFO, which prosecutes serious white collar crime, has charged the men over “capital raising arrangements” with Qatar Holding and Challenger in June and October 2008. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing. Lawyers say the performance of the SFO will be under as much scrutiny as that of the well-heeled defendants after a court threw out its separate charges against Barclays over the capital raising - and a judge last month halted its prosecution of former senior Tesco (TSCO.L) supermarket managers mid-trial. Lisa Osofsky, who took the top job at the agency last August, has stood back from handling the Barclays case because of a potential conflict of interest linked to her previous work. Mark Thompson, who was appointed interim SFO head until Osofsky took up the post, is overseeing the case. The new year has started briskly for the SFO. Its retrial of three former Barclays traders accused of plotting to rig Euribor global interest rates kicks off on Jan. 14. A jury was unable to reach a verdict in their case last year.",0
" The FTSE 100 fell on Monday as pessimism over the global economy and Brexit concerns arrested a rally prompted by U.S.-Sino trade talks, while mid-caps advanced in part thanks to an upbeat trading update from retailer Dunelm. The main index .FTSE fell 0.4 percent while a boost from consumer stocks helped the mid-cap index .FTMC notch a three-and-a-half-week high and close 1 percent higher. Talks between the world’s two biggest economies kicked off in Beijing on Monday, with the foreign ministry in Beijing saying it had the “good faith” to work with Washington to resolve trade frictions. Although UK stocks opened higher, the FTSE 100 - which makes about 70 percent of its income abroad - erased those early gains, with tobacco and consumer staples, including AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), Unilever (ULVR.L), the biggest drags, weighed down by a weaker dollar. British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L) extended losses to shed 4.2 percent and 5 percent, respectively, after a Cowen downgrade in light of higher e-cigarette use among youngsters. Miners helped cushion the market’s fall as metals prices climbed after China cut reserve requirement ratios. Overall, investors had doubts that the trade talks would deliver a long-term solution, and some of Monday’s falls were likely driven by traders taking profits after Friday’s rally. “Given the lowish status of the actual trade talk participants ...I think markets are taking a more wait-and-see approach on this issue - which is by far the most important influence on global market direction in 2019,” said Chris Bailey, a Raymond James analyst. “Of course, the UK specifically has the Brexit curveball to deal with too.” The European Commission reiterated that British Prime Minister Theresa’s May’s divorce deal would not be renegotiated, as a poll showed a record low of British voters think she has got the right agreement. May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if her deal is rejected by parliament this month, despite little sign that she has won over sceptical MPs. Stocks had rallied to record their best weekly gain in two months on Friday as strong U.S. jobs data and accommodative comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell boosted the market. A top mover on Monday was mid-cap homeware retailer Dunelm (DNLM.L) which surged 15 percent, its biggest one-day gain in nearly a decade, after it guided to a jump in first-half earnings. Consumer stocks were the biggest support to the index as a result. “This performance by an established market leader is doubly impressive considering the unhelpfully mild autumn weather and generally uncertain UK consumer environment,” wrote Stifel analysts. Madame Tussauds-owner Merlin Entertainments was 5.2 percent higher after a partnership agreement to build a Legoland theme park in South Korea. Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Tesco (TSCO.L) and Morrisons (MRW.L) rose 1.8-2.6 percent after German discount supermarket Aldi’s British unit reported higher sales for the Christmas week. UK retailers will be in focus this week with other supermarkets and high street chains also due to issue Christmas trading updates, as investors seek confirmation of how the battered sector fared over the holiday.

" British new car sales in 2018 fell at their fastest rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago, hit by the collapse in demand for diesel, as the industry body warned of the existential threat to the sector posed by Brexit. Registrations dropped 6.8 percent last year to 2.37 million vehicles, the largest fall since sales nosedived 11.3 percent in 2008, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed. A nearly 30 percent drop in demand for diesel was the most significant factor in the decline. Diesel has been pummelled since the Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal of 2015, prompting a crackdown and higher levies. But the industry also warned that Britain’s departure from the European Union due at the end of March risks the future of a sector which employs over 850,000 people and has been one of Britain’s few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s. “It’s still hard to see any upside to Brexit,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes. “Everyone recognises that Brexit is an existential threat to the UK automotive industry and we hope a practical solution will prevail,” he said, calling for lawmakers to back Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal to guarantee a transition period. Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the globe’s biggest trading bloc in just over 80 days with May’s agreement looking set to be voted down, leading to a possible no deal Brexit and the imposition of tariffs and customs checks. Investment looks very likely to have fallen in 2018, the SMMT said, and sales this year are forecast to drop again as the industry body warned a no-deal Brexit would hit jobs. “You’re not going to see immediate closure of plants but what you could see is a reduction in production volumes and certainly, these are often international companies who have alternatives,” said Hawes. After record highs in 2015 and 2016, sales fell in 2017 and some analysts see car demand as a leading indicator which could be a harbinger for future economic performance. Britain’s economy slowed to a crawl at the end of 2018, the housing market is stalling and lending to consumers growing at its slowest pace in nearly four years, according to data released on Friday. Diesel, which accounted for 48 percent of sales in 2016, fell to 42 percent in 2017 and just 32 percent in 2018, mirroring a trend seen in many European markets. The rise in petrol sales and drop in diesel means the average CO2 emissions of new cars sold in Britain in 2018 rose just under 3 percent, posing a headache for automakers who need to reduce levels to meet stricter regulations. New rules which came into force in September also impacted sales by disrupting the supply of some models, the SMMT said. Demand this year could also be distorted if Britons expect tariffs to be introduced after Brexit, perhaps pushing up registrations in the first three months of 2019. “The fear of them might encourage some people to purchase in the first quarter,” said Hawes. “The flip side of that is: ‘Well I don’t know what’s going to happen to the economy if you have a no deal so I’ll wait and see’.” Editing by Stephen Addison/Guy Faulconbridge MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" An aide to Iran’s supreme leader said on Monday U.S. officials approached him during a December visit to Afghanistan to request talks with Tehran, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, but the U.S. State Department denied the report. Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased since May, when President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers and later reimposed sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the pact. “During my visit to Kabul last month, the Americans ... asked to hold talks,” Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council and a close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying, without specifying what the U.S. side wanted to discuss. “This report is not accurate,” said a State Department spokeswoman on condition of anonymity. While denying it made a specific overture to Shamkani, the spokeswoman repeated that Trump is open to a dialogue with Iran on “urgent national security issues” and wants Tehran to “make fundamental changes in their destructive behaviour.” Washington accuses Tehran of destabilising the region by projecting its power via proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. In 2001, Iran worked with the United States to help set up a new Afghan government to replace the Taliban, which had been toppled by a U.S.-led military campaign following al Qaeda’s September 11 attacks on U.S. cities. Shamkhani was in Kabul last month for talks with the Taliban “to help curb the security problems in Afghanistan.” He said the Kabul government had known of his talks with the Taliban. Majority-Shi’ite Iran has long had close ties to Shi’ites in neighbouring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban’s Sunni militants. Washington accuses Iran of trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan by providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban, a charge Tehran denies. Shamkhani’s comments came days after reports of talks between U.S. and Taliban officials over proposals for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troops ahead of possible peace negotiations. Khamenei slapped down an offer of direct talks made by Trump last year and Iranian officials have said Washington’s crippling sanctions would fail to wreck the economy. In July, Iranian authorities said Tehran had rejected eight U.S. requests for a meeting between Trump and President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in Sept 2017.

" A Turkish court on Monday ordered the detention of a former opposition lawmaker hours after a lower court freed him on bail while he is being tried on terrorism-related charges, state-owned Anadolu news agency said. Eren Erdem, who lost his seat in the mid-2018 election that granted President Tayyip Erdogan sweeping new powers, has been jailed since June and accused of publishing illegal wiretaps while editor of an opposition newspaper in 2014. He denies charges of assisting followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of orchestrating a failed 2016 putsch. Prosecutors sought a sentence of up to 19 years for Erdem over “membership of an armed organisation” and aiding terrorists, Anadolu said. However, the court ruled on Monday that he should be released on bail. Hours later, a higher court overturned the release ruling, following an appeal by the Istanbul prosecutor’s office on grounds that Erdem may flee. He is the second politician from the secularist Republican People’s Party (CHP) to be detained in a sweeping security crackdown since the attempted military coup that has sparked outrage from rights groups and some of Turkey’s Western allies. The other CHP politician, Enis Berberoglu, was initially sentenced to 25 years in jail on espionage charges in June 2017, but was later released in September. He also denies the charges against him. The cleric Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan who now lives in the United States, denies any connection with the 2016 attempt to overthrow the government. Since then, 77,000 people have been formally arrested, while more than 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from jobs over alleged links to Gulen’s network. Foes have criticised the scale of the crackdown, saying Erdogan was using the putsch as an excuse to quash dissent. The government has said the measures are justified by the gravity of the threat. There was no immediate reaction from Erdem’s family or supporters.",0
" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, contesting an April election under the shadow of possible corruption charges, demanded on Monday to confront the state’s witnesses against him. Announcing on Twitter, three hours beforehand, that he would make a “special announcement” on Israeli TV, Netanyahu - now in his fourth term - touched off a wave of social media speculation that he might resign or even launch legal action of his own to try to stay any indictment. Instead, he kicked off Israel’s main TV evening news programmes with an anticlimactic speech in which he again professed his innocence in a series of corruption cases. He contended he was a victim of a political witchhunt and said he was being denied the chance to challenge his accusers face-to-face. “I demand a confrontation with the state’s witnesses now. What are they afraid of? What do they have to hide? I am not afraid and I have nothing to hide...As far as I am concerned it can be broadcast live, so the public can see and hear it.” In response, Israel’s Justice Ministry said the investigations against Netanyahu - who is now in his fourth term - have been carried out professionally and thoroughly. Netanyahu’s calling of the snap election, ahead of a national ballot due by November, was widely seen as a direct appeal to voters for a fresh political mandate that could help him weather a potential indictment. Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, said investigators had twice turned down his requests to confront the witnesses. At least three ex-Netanyahu confidants have agreed to provide evidence against him, Israeli media reports said. Netanyahu is enmeshed in three graft cases. He has said he would not bow out of the election race if Israel’s attorney-general announces his intention to accept police recommendations to indict him. Should he decide on an indictment, the attorney-general would, under Israeli law, then hold a hearing with Netanyahu in which the prime minister and his lawyers could make their case against filing charges in court. There has been mounting speculation in Israel that an indictment decision will be announced in the next few weeks, before election day. Police have alleged that Netanyahu granted regulatory favours to Israel’s leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel, in return for more positive coverage on a news website belonging to the firm’s owner. In a second case, police contend that Netanyahu received expensive gifts from wealthy friends. A third investigation focuses on suspicions that Netanyahu negotiated a deal with one newspaper for better coverage in return for promises to back legislation that would have limited the circulation of a rival.

" An Uber driver accused of fatally shooting six people in Michigan and wounding two others while on the job pleaded guilty to all charges on Monday, after initially blaming the ride sharing company’s app for compelling him to kill. Jason Dalton, 48, was charged with 16 counts, including six counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder after his nearly five-hour shooting spree on Feb. 20, 2016 in Kalamazoo, about 150 miles (240 km) west of Detroit. In April 2016, a judge ruled that Dalton was mentally competent to stand trial after psychiatrists determined he understood the charges against him. Two months later, prosecutors said Dalton’s attorney, Eusebio Solis, told them the defendant intended to file a motion to use the insanity defence. After his guilty plea on Monday, Dalton faces a life sentence without parole, Kalamazoo Prosecuting Attorney Jeffrey Getting said in a statement. Solis did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Dalton submitted his guilty plea while jury selection was taking place in Kalamazoo County court, where he was standing trial this week. In March 2016, Dalton filed a $10 million (7.83 million pounds) federal civil rights lawsuit against the ride-sharing company after telling investigators that Uber’s app had the ability to “take over” his body and compel him to kill. He told police that when he pressed a button on his phone screen, the horned cow head of a devil would appear and give him an assignment that he said would “literally take over” his body, local television station WZZM reported.",0
" Indian scientists have protested about claims made at a local science conference that rubbish the work of some of the world’s greatest physicists and suggest modern breakthroughs such as in-vitro fertilization were in fact invented in ancient India. In a lecture at the Indian Science Congress and posted on YouTube, one speaker, Kannan Jegathala Krishnan said Isaac Newton was wrong about gravity, Albert Einstein made a “big blunder” and questioned Stephen Hawking’s achievements. Another speaker, G. Nageswara Rao, a vice-chancellor at Andhra University in southern India, used stories from Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata as proof the people of ancient India had aircraft, test-tube babies and that stem-cell research “was done in this country thousands of years ago”. While organizers of the congress have promised to make changes for next year’s event following the criticism, Soumitro Banerjee, a physics professor and general secretary of non-profit Breakthrough Science Society, told Reuters the comments lent respectability to absurd theories. Scientists in Kolkata and five other cities carried placards and held silent demonstrations on Monday against the comments, he said. “This is very harmful for the growth of scientific temper because these ideas are being propagated through the Science Congress which gives it a respectability,” said Dhruba Mukhopadhyay, a retired professor and the president of the BSS, said. The conference’s organizer, the Indian Science Congress Association, will soon issue a statement condemning this episode, said Premendu P. Mathur, a general secretary at the body and a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology. “From next year we have decided that all the people, even top scientists, who want to interact with anybody at the Science Congress, would be asked to submit their abstracts, not to deviate from their abstracts and we will place one of our members there as a moderator.” The annual Indian Science Congress, which this year ran over five days at a university in northern Punjab state, ended on Monday.",0

" The Roman Catholic archbishop of Lyon, the highest-profile cleric to be caught up in the paedophile scandal inside the Catholic Church in France, told a court on Monday he never tried to cover up sexual abuse and was not guilty of anything. Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who stands trial alongside five others from his diocese, is accused of failing to report allegations of sexual abuse on Boy Scouts in the 1980s and early 1990s by Father Bernard Preynat. Preynat has admitted sexual abuse, according to his lawyer, and is due to go on trial later this year. “I never sought to conceal or cover up the facts,” Barbarin said on the first day of trial in Lyon. “I am grateful justice intervened in this affair, but I didn’t think it was up to me to file a complaint, especially since the victim was told it was too late to act,” he said. “I can’t see what I am guilty of.” While most of the recent focus in the Church’s global abuse crisis has been on Australia and Chile, Barbarin’s trial puts the spotlight on Europe’s senior clergy again, just as Pope Francis prepares to host a meeting of senior bishops from around the world in Rome next month to discuss the protection of minors. Barbarin, who moved to the Lyon diocese in 2002, visited the priest in his parish the same year but said he had not checked Preynat’s file, where mail from parents denouncing the abuse was recorded, before doing so. After being officially informed of Preynat’s actions in 2014, Barbarin said he convinced one of the alleged victims, Alexandre Hezez, to write a letter describing the facts, which he passed on to Church hierarchy in Rome. He removed the priest from his post in 2015, six months after being told to do so by the Vatican. “It was to avoid public scandal, just as Rome had suggested,” he told the court. Lyon prosecutors had previously investigated Barbarin but dropped the probe in the summer of 2016 without a detailed explanation. However, an association of alleged victims called Parole Liberee (“Freed Word”) used a provision of French law to compel the cardinal to stand trial. Pope Francis has come under fire over the Church’s handling of the spreading sexual abuse crisis. He met Barbarin in early 2016, and later told the Catholic newspaper La Croix that it would make no sense for the cardinal to resign before any eventual trial.",0
" A former French boxing champion filmed landing punches on riot police during a ‘yellow vest’ protest in Paris last weekend turned himself in on Monday, saying he was defending himself. Christophe Dettinger, who was twice national light-heavyweight champion, was caught on camera jumping over the railings of a pedestrian bridge blocked by baton-wielding police before swinging blows at the officers, forcing them to retreat. Nicknamed the “Gypsy of Massy”, the 1.92m (6ft 4in) tall Dettinger was taking part in an eighth Saturday of anti-government protests that have undermined President Emmanuel Macron’s authority. The demonstration began peacefully but turned aggressive as police fired tear gas to prevent protesters, who torched cars and burned barricades, from reaching parliament. “I was gassed with my friend, my wife, and at some point I was taken over by anger, so yes I acted badly. I acted badly, but I defended myself,” Dettinger said in a video posted on Facebook before he handed himself in to police who arrested him. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner described Dettinger’s assault as “cowardly and intolerable”. In another video, Dettinger, wearing a black hat, gloves and coat but no mask, can be seen kicking a policeman on the ground. One of the officers the former boxer attacked has been sent on 15 days’ sick-leave, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office. Macron has been shaken by the demonstrations and the authorities’ struggle to maintain order at the weekend raises questions over policing tactics and the president’s broader response to the wave of unrest. That is likely to be closely scrutinised as he prepares to bring in stricter rules for unemployment benefits and cut thousands of public sector jobs.",0
" Nongovernmental organizations working in Brazil will have their public funding rigidly controlled, President Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday, as part of increased oversight of their activities by his new right-wing administration. The plans have raised concerns that NGO activities might be restricted by a nationalist government that has criticized foreign interference in the Amazon region. The responsibility for monitoring NGOs has been put in the hands of Government Secretary Carlos dos Santos Cruz, a retired Army general who has said the initiative will help determine whether the organizations are fulfilling their role of carrying out work that complements government actions. An executive order issued last week gave the new administration potentially far-reaching and restrictive powers over NGOs. “The government’s intention is to optimise the use of public funds and bring more benefits” to people assisted by the NGOs, Cruz said in an interview published on Monday on the G1 news portal. He denied the intention was to restrict their activity. “The plan is not to interfere in the life of the organizations or restrict anything. But it’s public money. There needs to be transparency and there needs to be results,” Cruz said. Jurema Werneck, the executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, expressed concern about the new measures, saying NGOs were crucial in maintaining checks and balances on democratic institutions. Eroding their influence could lead to a rise in rights violations, she said. The “unprecedented” move on NGOs showed that Bolsonaro’s government “intends to intervene in their activities, favouring a process of criminalisation and restriction of freedom of expression,” said Werneck. Increasing oversight over NGOs was one of Bolsonaro’s very first acts after he was sworn in on Jan. 1. Bolsonaro’s temporary decree, which expires unless it is ratified within 120 days by Congress, gives Cruz’s office the power to “supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international organizations and nongovernmental organizations in the national territory.”",0
" Slovakia’s dominant political figure Robert Fico will run to become a Constitutional Court judge this month, seeking to quit party politics less than a year after he was pushed out of prime minister’s office in the furore over the murder of a journalist. The murder of Jan Kuciak, who investigated political corruption and EU subsidy fraud, and his fiancee Martina Kusnirova triggered biggest protests since the 1989 fall of communism against the sleaze in politics. Fico resigned in March after being in power for almost a decade, but remains chairman of the ruling Smer party and is seen as driving policy behind the scenes while party ally Peter Pellegrini serves as prime minister. Now Fico, 54, who has a law degree and represented Slovakia at the European Court of Human Rights in 1994-2000, has been nominated to become a Constitutional Court judge. The body is the country’s top court, which rules on whether legislation passed by parliament and judgements by lower courts are in line with the constitution. Former lawmakers have been elected previously to serve on it, but never former party leaders or prime ministers. The parliament, where the governing coalition has a narrow majority of 76 out of 150 votes, will select 18 candidates to become Constitutional Court judges in a vote later this month. President Andrej Kiska, who is unaffiliated with any party and who sided with protesters calling for Fico’s ousting, will pick nine of them to replace judges whose term expire on Feb. 16. The court has 13 judges in total, elected for a term of 12 years.",0
" British carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L) has triggered contingency plans to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in components as well as use ports other than Dover. Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union in just over 80 days but a negotiated withdrawal agreement looks set to be voted down by MPs next week, making a “no deal” exit - and disruption to trade - more likely. Britain’s car industry, which employs over 850,000 people and is one of the country’s rare manufacturing success stories, has warned that leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without a deal would add costs and could halt output due to snarl-ups. Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which outlined its contingency plans in October, had no choice but to authorise them at a board meeting in December. “I don’t think we’ve been in a position in the last two years where we’ve been further apart from understanding where we’re going to end up,” Palmer told Reuters, declining to put a figure on the “accumulating” cost of the plans. “We programme a car to align and order all the parts for those cars twelve weeks in advance. You don’t need to do the maths to know that therefore takes us across the Brexit period.” “We have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Aston Martin, the preferred drive of fictional secret agent James Bond, joins a growing list of companies readying for a no deal Brexit. Data last week showed manufacturers ramping up stocks in preparation for potential border delays. Aston is signing deals with supplier DHL to allow for the use of ports other than Dover - Britain’s busiest and so most likely to be disrupted by any customs delays - and has authorised its supply chain team to make air freight bookings. The government has said it will prioritise the movement of key supplies such as medicines if the flow of goods is hit after Brexit, so it is unclear what would happen to other items. “We don’t have any assurances,” said Palmer. “One assumes if you’re putting parts onto a standard chartered plane, no one’s going to kick you off.” Aston Martin, which built more than 6,000 top-end models last year at its central English plant in Gaydon, its only factory, is also holding a stock of cars in Germany. “It’s an inventory to some extent that we put in place during the course of 2018 ... and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, may or may not increase,” Palmer said. Carmakers fear their just-in-time production will grind to a halt if there are delays imposed after Brexit, but different manufacturers face different challenges. Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), Britain’s favourite carmaker accounting for over 20 percent of sales, builds only 11,000 Bentleys in the country, while Ford (F.N) counts Britain as its third-largest market but makes no cars there. Meantime Nissan (7201.T), which builds around half a million cars at its northern English Sunderland plant, and Toyota (7203.T) export the overwhelming majority of their British-built vehicles to the rest of the EU. While mass-market brands are most worried about potential trade tariffs, smaller, high-end players such as Aston and McLaren believe their affluent customers could absorb extra costs and are more concerned about customs checks and delays. Aston has hired John Griffiths, who has worked for Nissan and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce, as interim vice president for supply chain, in a role Palmer said “there was a nagging need (for) which has been confirmed with Brexit.” Palmer criticised politicians on both sides of the Channel. “Both the European and the UK politicians are not discharging the duty for which they are put in place which is basically to plan and bring certainty to allow the country to thrive,” he said. As carmakers prepare for multiple Brexit eventualities, they are also dealing with stricter emissions rules and a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy, China, which has hit a variety of firms including Apple (AAPL.O). While some automakers have reported falling demand, Aston, which has seen its share price fall by more than a third since it listed in October, said it had a record 2018. “There has not been any downflow since those (Q3) numbers so in fact, broadly speaking, the opposite as we launched (sports cars) DBS and Vantage into China,” said Palmer.

" Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has dropped its investigation of some individuals associated with Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L), it said on Monday, narrowing the number of suspects in a long-running bribery probe. Rolls-Royce signed a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the SFO in a 497 million pound settlement almost two years ago, clearing the company but allowing for continued investigation and potential prosecution of individuals. “Some individuals were notified that they are no longer suspects in the Rolls-Royce investigation,” the SFO said on Monday. The company has been investigated by British, U.S. and Brazilian authorities into alleged criminal conduct spanning three decades, at least seven jurisdictions and three of the company’s business sectors. Rolls-Royce said it notes the latest action taken by the SFO and that it continues to co-operate fully with authorities pursuing inquiries into individuals.",0
" An 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family and barricaded herself inside a Bangkok airport hotel to prevent being expelled by Thai authorities has left the airport after talks with the United Nations refugee agency, an official said on Monday. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun has been at Bangkok’s international airport since Saturday when she arrived from Kuwait, saying she fears her family will kill her if she is forced to return home. Her relatives have not commented on her accusations of abuse and Reuters was not able to reach them. The case has drawn new global attention to Saudi Arabia’s strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male “guardian” to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families. It comes at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of a journalist at its consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen. Thai immigration officials had planned to put Qunun on a flight back to Kuwait on Monday, but relented after her online pleas drew international attention. She told Reuters via text and audio messages she had fled Kuwait during a family visit there, and had planned to travel to Australia to seek asylum. She said she was held after leaving her plane in Bangkok and told she would be sent back to Kuwait. “They will kill me,” Qunun told Reuters. “My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things.” A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) met Qunun at the airport and also discussed the case with Thai immigration officials. After the meeting, Thailand’s immigration chief said she would not be expelled. “We will take her into Bangkok and provide her with safe shelter under the care of the UNHCR,” immigration chief Surachate Hakparn told reporters on Monday evening. He said the UNHCR would work on processing Qunun’s request for refugee status. Giuseppe de Vincentis, the UNHCR representative in Thailand, said the Thai government had given assurances Qunun would not be expelled to any country where she might be in danger while her case was being processed. Qunun posted a video on Twitter on Monday of her barricading her hotel door with a table and a mattress. She said her family was powerful in Saudi society but she did not identify them. Asked why she was seeking refuge in Australia, she told Reuters: “Physical, emotional and verbal abuse and being imprisoned inside the house for months. They threaten to kill me and prevent me from continuing my education. “They won’t let me drive or travel. I am oppressed. I love life and work and I am very ambitious but my family is preventing me from living.” The Saudi foreign ministry said in a tweet that its embassy was in touch with the woman’s father and the Thai government, but its diplomats had not met or communicated with her. New York-based Human Rights Watch said Thailand should not send Qunun back to her family because she says she faces danger. Qunun said she had obtained an Australian visa and booked a flight. She said she had planned to spend a few days in Thailand so she would not spark suspicion when she left Kuwait. Thai immigration chief Surachate, however, said that Qunun did not have a visa for Australia. The Australian Embassy said it had no immediate comment. Contradicting earlier accounts from Thai officials, Surachate said Thai authorities had been contacted by the Saudis before deciding to deny Qunun entry to the country. “The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police ... and said that the girl had run away from her parents and they fear for her safety,” he said. “We acknowledged this and checked her paperwork. She had a passport but no return ticket, no travel plan, and no destination or hotel reservation in Thailand ... so per airport security procedures, immigration denied her entry.” Additional reporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat and Panu Wongcha-um in BANGKOK and Ghaida Ghantous in DUBAI; Editing by Nick Macfie and Peter Graff MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED SPONSORED All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" A U.S. judge said on Monday that a lawyer defending a target of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian election meddling engaged in “unprofessional, inappropriate and ineffective” conduct, prompting the lawyer to say he might withdraw from the case. Judge Dabney Friedrich told lawyer Eric Dubelier to stop what she called “meritless personal attacks” against Mueller’s team. Dubelier is defending Concord Management and Consulting LLC, a Russian firm accused of funding a propaganda operation to sway the 2016 presidential election in Donald Trump’s favour. “I’ll say it plain and simple: knock it off,” Friedrich told Dubelier in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Dubelier said he needed to check with Concord to see if they still wanted him to work on the case, given that there appeared to be “some bias on the part of the court” against him. In court filings, Dubelier has quoted movies such as “Animal House” and cartoon characters like Tweety Bird in criticizing Mueller’s long-running investigation as illegitimate and has sought to have the charges dismissed. Friedrich has twice refused to dismiss the charges against Concord. Prosecutors contend that Concord is controlled by Evgeny Prigozhin, a businessman identified by Russian media as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. officials have said Prigozhin has extensive ties to Russia’s military and political establishment. Concord is one of three entities, along with 13 Russian individuals, indicted by Mueller’s office in an alleged criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper with the 2016 U.S. election, boost Trump’s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied any involvement. Trump has said there was no collusion between the Kremlin and his campaign, while repeatedly criticizing the Mueller probe as a “witch hunt.”",0
"3 MIN READ LONDON, Reuters - A leading geneticist who ran the conference where a Chinese scientist said he had made the world’s first “gene-edited” babies condemned him on Monday for potentially jeopardising lives and having no biology training. Robin Lovell-Badge, organiser of the November 2018 event where China’s He Jiankui made his controversial presentation, described him as a rich man with a “huge ego” who “wanted to do something he thinks will change the world”. He Jiankui, associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, sparked an international scientific and ethical row when he said he had used a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born in November. He did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Chinese authorities are investigating him and have meanwhile halted this kind of research. In videos posted online and at the conference, He said he believed his gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Lovell-Badge, a professor and gene expert at Britain’s Francis Crick Institute who led the organising committee for the November Human Genome Editing Summit at Hong Kong University, said it was impossible to know what He had actually done. “If it’s true (that he edited the genomes in the way he says) then it is certainly possible that he has put the children’s lives at risk,” he told journalists in London. “No-one knows what these mutations will do.” Lovell-Badge said he originally invited He to the conference after hearing in scientific circles that he was “up to something”. Lovell-Badge hoped that asking He to interact with specialists would encourage him to “control his urges”. “Pretty much everyone he talked to had said to him: ‘Don’t do it’,” he said. “But clearly it was all too late.” Lovell-Badge said he learned of He’s claims on the eve of the conference, and had an emergency meeting with him. “He thought that he was doing good, and that what he was doing was the next big thing,” Lovell-Badge said. But he had “no basic training in biology” and the experiments he said he had carried out “ignored all the norms of how you conduct any clinical trial or clinical experiment.” “He should certainly be stopped from doing anything like this again,” he said. Lovell-Badge said he had not heard from He since early December, but understood he was in Shenzhen in a guarded apartment during the probe. Chinese authorities and institutions, as well as hundreds of international scientists, have condemned He and said any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was against the law and medical ethics of China.",0
" Some Polish bishops should lose their jobs after Pope Francis receives a report next month that will accuse them of failing in their duty to report paedophile cases inside the country’s powerful Catholic Church, activists said on Monday. The Roman Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors in a number of countries including Chile, the United States, Australia and Ireland. In devoutly Catholic Poland, debate on the issue has barely begun, but the anti-paedophilia foundation “Have no fear” is compiling a report on abuse and said it would soon inform Polish prosecutors of 20 previously unreported sexual crimes. “By the end of January we will have a report documenting Polish bishops’ negligence which will be presented in February at the Vatican,” Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an activist and lawmaker from the small opposition party “Now”, told a news conference. “When it turned out that bishops in Chile had concealed paedophile crimes, they lost their jobs. Plenty of bishops in Poland should bear the same consequences,” she said. Senior bishops from around the world are due to meet Pope Francis at a conference in the Vatican in February to discuss protection of minors. Organisers say the Church must show full accountability or risk losing further credibility worldwide. In its campaign to expose paedophile priests in Poland, “Have no fear” in October posted an interactive paedophilia map on the internet which has seen some five million clicks and prompted about 300 allegations of sexual misconduct by clergy. Now the foundation is encouraging victims to report their cases and offers lawyers’ help to those who previously stayed silent for fear they would be doubted or shunned. Asked about the report, a spokesman for the Polish Episcopate Conference, Pawel Rytel-Andrianik said: “The protection of children and young people is of the utmost importance, which is why the bishops remind (people) that there is an obligation to report cases of abuse to the prosecutor’s office.” He declined to comment directly on the report as it had not yet been made available. In a November statement, Poland’s bishops asked victims of clerical abuse for forgiveness and said the Church had begun collecting data to assess the scale of crimes. About 12 million people, or almost a third of Poland’s population, regularly attend mass, according to a survey by the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics, a Warsaw-based research centre.",0
" Gabon foiled an attempted military coup on Monday, killing two suspected plotters and capturing seven others just hours after they took over state radio in a bid to end 50 years of rule by President Ali Bongo’s family. Government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou announced the deaths and arrests after soldiers briefly seized the radio station and broadcast a message saying Bongo was no longer fit for office after suffering a stroke in Saudi Arabia in October. The quick failure of Monday’s coup and the lack of widespread support suggest further efforts to overthrow Bongo are unlikely, analysts said. But the attempt alone shows a growing frustration with a government weakened by the President’s secretive medical leave. On Dec. 31, in one of his first television appearances since the stroke, Bongo, 59, slurred his speech and he appeared unable to move his right arm. It is unclear if he is able to walk. He has been in Morocco since November to continue treatment. In a radio message at 4:30 a.m. (0330 GMT), Lieutenant Kelly Ondo Obiang, who described himself as an officer in the Republican Guard, said Bongo’s New Year’s Eve address “reinforced doubts about the president’s ability to continue to carry out of the responsibilities of his office”. Outside the radio station, loyalist soldiers fired teargas to disperse about 300 people who had come out into the streets to support the coup attempt, a Reuters witness said. Helicopters circled overhead and there was a strong military and police presence on the streets. Most of the beachside capital was quiet, however, and a government spokesman said the situation was under control after the arrests. Residents said Internet access was cut. “The government is in place. The institutions are in place,” Mapangou told France 24. The Bongo family has ruled the oil-producing country since 1967. Bongo has been president since succeeding his father, Omar, who died in 2009. His re-election in 2016 was marred by claims of fraud and violent protest. The economy was long buoyed by oil revenues, much of which went to a moneyed elite while most of the two-million population live in deep poverty. In Libreville, expensive western hotels overlook the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the capital’s hillside shanties to the east. A sharp drop in oil output and prices in recent years has squeezed revenues, raised debt and stoked discontent. Oil workers’ strikes have become more common. Economic growth was 2 percent last year, down from over 7 percent in 2011. The coup indicates “broad socio-economic and political frustration with Gabon’s leadership, which has been weakened by the suspected incapacitation of its strongman president,” Exx Africa Business Risk Intelligence said in a report. The international community condemned the coup attempt, including former colonial ruler France which urged its 8,900 citizens registered in Gabon to avoid moving around Libreville. “Gabon’s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said. African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat reaffirmed “the AU’s total rejection of all unconstitutional changes of power.” In a video on social media, Ondo is seen in a radio studio wearing military fatigues and a green beret as he reads the statement. Two other soldiers with rifles stand behind him. Ondo said the coup attempt was by a group called the Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon against “those who, in a cowardly way, assassinated our young compatriots on the night of August 31, 2016,” a reference to violence after Bongo was declared winner of a disputed election. Bongo won the poll by fewer than 6,000 votes, sparking deadly clashes between protesters and police during which the parliament was torched. “President Bongo’s record as defence minister under his father lowers the possibility that current military leadership is supportive of his ouster,” said Judd Devermont of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. France has a permanent force of 300 soldiers in Gabon. The United States also sent about 80 soldiers to Gabon last week in response to possible violence in Democratic Republic of Congo after a presidential election there. Foreign governments have often suspected Bongo and members of his government of corruption, accusations they have denied. During his father’s rule, Gabon was a pillar of “La Francafrique”, a web of influence that gave French companies favoured access to African autocrats. Gabon’s dollar-denominated sovereign debt <XS1003557870=TE > <US362420AC51=TE > tumbled in early trading, with both outstanding bonds losing around 3 cents in the dollar. However, prices recovered in late morning, with bonds trading around half a cent lower.

" A U.S. guided-missile destroyer sailed near disputed islands in the South China Sea in what China called a “provocation” as U.S. officials joined talks in Beijing during a truce in a bitter trade war. The USS McCampbell carried out a “freedom of navigation” operation, sailing within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Island chain, “to challenge excessive maritime claims”, Pacific Fleet spokeswoman Rachel McMarr said in an emailed statement. The operation was not about any one country or to make a political statement, McMarr said. The statement came as trade talks between China and the United States were under way in Beijing, the first round of face-to-face discussions since both sides agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has roiled international markets. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the conduct of the U.S. ship had violated China’s and international law, and China had lodged “stern representations”. “We urge the United States to immediately cease this kind of provocation,” he said, adding that China had sent military ships and aircraft to identify and warn off the ship. China’s defence ministry added that the ship had “gravely infringed upon China’s sovereignty”. “We will be on high alert and will closely monitor the air and sea situation to strongly defend our sovereignty and security,” it said in comments carried by state media. Asked about the timing of the operation during trade talks, Lu said resolving issues would help both countries and the world. “Both sides have the responsibility to create the necessary positive atmosphere for this,” he said. China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan have competing claims in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in December agreed to put on hold a spiralling trade dispute of tit-for-tat import tariffs on hundreds of billions worth of goods. Trump has imposed tariffs to pressure Beijing to change its practices on issues ranging from corporate espionage to market access and industrial subsidies. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own. Fears have grown in recent months that the dispute is just one vector in a bilateral relationship that is fast cooling across the board, with top administration officials sharply criticizing Beijing for everything from human rights abuses and its influence operations in the United States. The two countries are also at odds over regional security, including Washington’s overtures to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own. China and the United States have in the past repeatedly traded barbs over what Washington says is Beijing’s militarization of the South China Sea by building military installations on artificial islands and reefs. China defends its construction as necessary for self-defence and says that it is rather Washington that is responsible for ratcheting up tensions in the region by sending warships and military plans close to islands Beijing claims.",0
" At the height of Pol Pot’s genocidal Khmer Rouge “killing fields” regime which devastated Cambodia for more than three years from 1975-79, Srey Heng overcame her crippling hunger by catching and eating frogs, snails and insects. “I was just skin and bones,” said Srey Heng, who was conscripted by the Khmer Rouge into a mobile labour unit for children, and forced to dig canals. Thousands of Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge marked the 40th anniversary of their demise in a commemoration in Phnom Penh on Monday. About 60,000 people gathered at a stadium in the capital, where dancers and performers held banners and waved flags in scenes reminiscent of an Olympic opening ceremony. The event was organised by the ruling Cambodian People’s party (CPP), whose Prime Minister Hun Sen has led the Southeast Asian country for more than 33 years. The 66-year-old, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, came to power under a government installed by Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978 and captured Phom Penh on Jan. 7, 1979, ending Khmer Rouge rule and forcing its leader, Pol Pot, into hiding. Much of the event was dedicated to the achievements of Hun Sen, who has come under fire from rights groups for his intimidation of political opponents and for winning a widely criticised general election last July. Songs praising the prime minister as a “peaceful and loyal statesman” echoed through the stadium. Traditional dancers performed in honour of his policies. Outside, survivors like Srey Heng, now a street vendor selling water and soft drinks, cast a more sombre figure compared with the scenes inside. “Many of my relatives died under Pol Pot because they were hungry, Srey Heng said. “I don’t even know what happened to the others”. An estimated 1.7 million people died at the hands of the extremist, communist regime. Most victims died of torture, starvation, disease, or exhaustion in labour camps. Others were beaten to death during mass executions. Seang Tharuon, 69, lost 11 siblings and both her parents during the killings. She was forced by the Khmer Rouge to marry her husband. Like many others, Seang Tharuon was evacuated from Phom Penh by the Khmer Rouge at the start of its nightmarish rule. She walked for more than 100 km (62 miles) from the countryside back to the capital when the regime fell in 1979. “We mainly had gruel to eat, and they would let us eat rice once a month,” Seang Tharuon told Reuters as she bought drinks from Srey Heng’s stall outside the stadium. In downtown Phnom Penh, former Khmer Rouge soldier Prum Punly balanced on one leg as he fed birds by the river. He lost his other leg to a landmine while fighting against U.S.-backed Cambodian government forces in 1975, as the Khmer Rouge came to power: “I was too young to understand politics,” the 67-year-old said. “It was chaos”.",0
" The day before Deb Haaland was sworn in last week as a freshman lawmaker in the most diverse U.S. House of Representatives class in history, she said the weight of being one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress had not yet fully hit her. Haaland, 58, had just conducted a brief staff meeting and was sitting in her new office on Capitol Hill as staffers got phones working and solved logistical problems like wrestling a printer through a narrow doorway. The first-time elected official represents New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District and is a member of the state’s Laguna Pueblo tribe. “Congress has never heard a voice like mine,” the Democrat said. “As the first Native American woman in Congress, I know that there will be an expectation on me by tribes across the country to be somebody that can move their issues forward,” Haaland said. “That’s absolutely something I feel optimistic that I will be able to do.” She said there is an “epidemic” of missing and murdered indigenous women, and Haaland would like Congress to hold additional oversight hearings on the issue and make sure tribal justice systems have the resources they need to conduct proper investigations. Also at the top of her list is combating climate change, which threatens fragile tribal lands. “If you’re not scared to death right now about climate change, you’re not reading the news,” she said. Haaland is one of a record-breaking 102 women who will serve in the 435-seat House during the 2019-2020 session. There are many firsts among them. Haaland and Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, are the first Native American women. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan are the first Muslim women. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Jahana Hayes of Connecticut are the first black women to represent their states. All are Democrats. When Haaland was born in 1960, Native Americans did not have the right to vote in New Mexico - despite being granted full U.S. citizenship by the federal government in 1924. They got it in 1962, making the Southwestern state the last in the nation to extend it. On Thursday, Haaland welcomed her new constituents to an open house at her congressional office before being sworn in on the House floor. She wore traditional tribal garments to the ceremony, including a pomegranate blossom necklace of silver and turquoise, signifying protection and strength, made by a Laguna artist. After raising her hand to take the oath of office with her peers, the consequence of the milestone sunk in. Overcome with emotion, Haaland turned to embrace Davids, borrowing the edge of her new colleague’s scarf to dab away her tears. For photo essay, please click on: reut.rs/2FdvcIx",0

" German government officials called on Monday for a tightening of data security laws after a far-reaching breach exposed the documents of hundreds of politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel. The leader of the opposition Greens party said he had cancelled his Twitter and Facebook accounts following the data breach, one of the largest ever in privacy-conscious Germany. Stephan Mayer, state secretary in the Interior Ministry, said authorities were working around the clock to investigate the breach, and would provide more details around mid-week. Mayer reiterated that government networks had not been breached, but said the ministry was working to tighten the cyber security of critical infrastructure and would also beef up the federal cyber security centre leading the current investigation. “One bit of positive news is that government networks are apparently not affected by this or these hacker attacks. But it’s clear that we as the federal government ... must do more to improve cyber security,” he said. German police on Sunday searched the apartment of Jan Schuerlein, a 19-year-old IT worker in the southern city of Heilbronn. Schuerlein said on Twitter he was being treated as a witness in the investigation given his contact with “0rbit”, the holder of a Twitter account that was used to publish the data but has since been shut down. Schuerlein said he was cooperating with police, according to broadcaster rbb, which first reported the police search. Little is known about the user “0rbit”. A spokesman for state prosecutors declined to comment on Sunday’s raid, but said the investigation was continuing. Justice Minister Katarina Barley and Germany’s digital coordinator, Dorothea Baer, also called on Monday for tougher social media controls following the data breach, which began in December but initially went largely unnoticed. “Such an attack must be used as a reason to very carefully examine if everything has been done to achieve the best possible security of data,” Baer told the Handelsblatt newspaper. “It is legitimate to examine whether software manufacturers and platforms must be required to do more to ensure data security,” she told the paper, without providing any details. Robert Habeck, leader of the Greens, said he had cancelled his Twitter account after he spoke disparagingly about the eastern German state of Thuringia in a video tweet. He said the medium caused him to be “more aggressive” than he would otherwise be. Habeck said he was also deleting his Facebook account because it was the main tool used to spread private data published as a result of the breach, including chats with his family members. No comment was immediately available from Twitter. Facebook declined to comment on the data breach issue.",0

" Pope Francis warned on Monday against a resurgence of nationalist and populist movements and criticised countries that try to solve the migration crisis with unilateral or isolationist actions. The pope, speaking to diplomats in an annual speech known informally as his “state of the world” address, suggested such movements and closed-door policies were turning the clock back 100 years to the dangerous period between the world wars. Relationships within the international community “are experiencing a period of difficulty, with the resurgence of nationalistic tendencies,” he said, making dialogue between countries and hurting the most vulnerable members of society, including migrants. Populist anti-immigrant parties made gains in a number of countries last year, including Italy, France, the Netherlands, Hungary, Brazil and Poland. In the United States, a partial government shutdown entered its third week as President Donald Trump has pledged not to bend in his demand for a wall along the southern border with Mexico.. In his hour-long speech, Francis several times mentioned the League of Nations, which was set up after World War One to promote peace but failed to stop the nationalist and populist movements that helped lead to World War Two. “The reappearance of these impulses today is progressively weakening the multilateral system,” he told envoys from 183 countries in the speech, which touched on the situation in many countries. While migration has led to diffidence and unilateral actions by governments, particularly in Europe and North America, the international community has a duty to defend refugees and migrants, he said. “I do not believe that partial solutions can exist for so universal an issue,” he said. Francis praised the United Nations’ Global Compact on Migration, which set objectives for how the movement of people can be managed. The United States, Italy, Hungary and Poland are among nations that boycotted the meeting in Morocco last year. The pope again condemned the arms trade and possession of nuclear weapons, lamenting that past efforts at nuclear disarmament had given way to “the search for new and increasingly sophisticated and destructive weapons”. He called for a more decisive commitment to combating global warming and for “rethinking our relationship with our planet”. Calling sexual abuse of children “one of the plagues of our time”, he said a meeting of key bishops at the Vatican in February would aim to “shed full light on the facts and to alleviate the wounds caused by such crimes”.

" China has lodged “stern representations” with the United States over a U.S. navy vessel sailing through the disputed South China Sea, its foreign ministry said on Monday.

" Ukraine’s Orthodox Christian Church celebrated its first Christmas on Monday outside Russian control and President Petro Poroshenko said the document enshrining its newly gained independence had broken “the last fetters tying us to Moscow”. Hundreds of Ukrainians queued in the snow after the lavish two-hour liturgy at Kiev’s St Sophia Cathedral to view the document, known as a “Tomos”, which was only handed to the head of the new Church Metropolitan Epifaniy on Sunday. Many Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7, not Dec. 25, as they follow a different calendar. Accompanied by Poroshenko, Epifaniy processed into the cathedral on Monday carrying the decree, a scrolled white parchment. White-robed clergy then unfurled it and placed it in front of the iconostasis, a richly decorated screen that separates the sanctuary from the nave in Orthodox churches. “For the first time, we celebrate Christmas with an independent autocephalous church,” said Poroshenko after the service. “It is the basis of our spiritual freedom, we broke the last fetters tying us to Moscow,” said the president, who faces a tough re-election battle this year. Russia bitterly opposes the move to grant the Ukrainian Church autocephalous, or self-governing, status, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. The Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow has called the leaders of the Ukrainian Church charlatans and schismatics, and President Vladimir Putin has warned of possible bloodshed. Despite the snowy weather, hundreds of people watched Monday’s service on a big screen outside because there was not enough space in the packed cathedral to accommodate them. “This is the most happy day in the life of every Ukrainian. And I understand that every soul desires to be here,” Oksana Pasenok, a university professor, told Reuters. People formed a long queue after the service to see the decree, which will remain on public display. “Today the words of those holy fathers who died for Ukraine, for our freedom, for our liberty, come true,” said Oleksandr Sydoruk, engineer, standing in the queue to see the document. “Today, with this ‘Tomos’, our Ukrainian Church and Ukraine revive. And this is a day of joy for all Ukrainian Orthodox believers.” St Sophia Cathedral was built by the son of Prince Volodymyr, whose baptism in 988 led to the spread of Christianity across what are now Ukraine and Russia. Russians trace the origins of their own nation to the Kievan state of that era. The rupture in inter-church relations mirrors the collapse of political relations between Moscow and Kiev following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.",0
" A small regional party in India quit Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling coalition on Monday, protesting against his bid to give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of non-Muslims from neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. Modi said last week his government was determined to pass a bill in parliament to relax rules for Hindus and other non-Muslim minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to become citizens of Hindu-majority India. Critics have called the bill, to be discussed in parliament on Tuesday, an attempt by Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to boost its Hindu voter base ahead of a national election due by May. The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), based in the border state of Assam in India’s northeast, has become the fourth ally to quit the ruling National Democratic Alliance in the past year, for a variety of reasons. Protests have erupted in recent months and on Monday in Assam, where a movement against illegal immigrants, of all religions, from Bangladesh has simmered for decades, with some residents blaming them for eating into their resources and job opportunities. It is estimated that millions of Bengali-speaking people in Assam trace their roots to Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which won independence from Pakistan in 1971 with India’s help. “The home minister clearly told us they will try to get this bill passed tomorrow, so there’s no question us staying with the BJP anymore,” AGP President Atul Bora told reporters in New Delhi. The BJP has the numbers in the Assam assembly to stay in power in the state despite the AGP pullout, but the regional party could help galvanise anger amongst many ethnic Assamese opposed to giving citizenship to migrants who came to India after 1971. That could hurt the BJP’s goal of sharply increasing its parliamentary seats from the northeast region of the country in the national election. At least two of the parties that have left the BJP fold have already largely agreed to ally with the main opposition Congress, which hopes to take on Modi as a united front and says the citizenship should not discriminate against Muslims. The BJP says it is in favour of institutionalising “constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards” to the ethnic Assamese, but also wants to give citizenship to Hindus from Bangladesh as the growth in the Hindu population of Assam had been overtaken by that of Muslims. “We’re trying to save Assam from Jinnah,” BJP leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, referring to Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah who was instrumental in carving Muslim-dominated Pakistan out of India after winning independence from British colonial rule in 1947.",0

" A feud between Singapore’s prime minister and his siblings resurfaced on Monday when the public prosecutor said there were questions over the involvement of a family member in the preparation of their father’s will. The case, which comes ahead of a general election expected as soon as this year, stems from a dispute over the old house of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first premier and the father of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The siblings have publicly bickered since June 2017 over the future of the family home in which the late leader, who died in 2015, had lived for most of his life. Prime Minister Lee’s younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, and sister, Lee Wei Ling, want the house to be eventually demolished in accordance, they have said, with their father’s wishes as stated in his will. But the prime minister has questioned whether his father really wanted the home, near Singapore’s bustling Orchard Road shopping district, to be knocked down. He has said he has recused himself from government discussions on the matter. On Monday, the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) said it had referred to the Law Society a case of “possible professional misconduct” over the involvement of the wife of the prime minister’s brother in the will. The wife, Lee Suet Fern, who is a lawyer, appears to have prepared the elder Lee’s last will despite the fact that her husband was one of the beneficiaries of the will, the AGC said in a statement. Lee Suet Fern declined to comment. She has never commented on whether she had prepared the late founder’s will. In a Facebook post late on Sunday, Lee Wei Ling said: “Lee Kuan Yew, a highly regarded lawyer, never complained about his will ... Why therefore this new attack on our father’s will? Why is this being initiated now, and by the AGC, after all this time?” The government panel that had been set up to examine the future of the house said early last year that a future government should make the final call.",0
" Last year was the fourth warmest on record, extending a scorching streak driven by a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Monday. Average world surface air temperatures were 14.7 Celsius (58.5 Fahrenheit) in 2018, just 0.2C off the highest, it said in the first global assessment based on full-year data. This year will also likely be hot, its scientists said. “Dramatic climatic events like the warm and dry summer in large parts of Europe or the increasing temperature around the Arctic regions are alarming signs to all of us,” said Jean-Noël Thépaut, head of Copernicus. Among other extremes in 2018, California and Greece suffered severe wildfires, Kerala in India had the worst flooding since the 1920s and heatwaves struck from Australia to North Africa. Around Antarctica, the extent of sea ice is at a record low at the start of 2019, according to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. Copernicus chief scientist Freja Vamborg said 2019 would also likely be hot. “We now have a nascent El Nino - it depends partly on what happens ... will it continue or die out?” she told Reuters. The last four years have seen the highest average temperatures since records began in the 19th century - 2016 was the hottest, boosted by an El Nino event that warmed the surface of the Pacific Ocean, ahead of 2017 and then 2015. The Copernicus report said that concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to a new record of 406.7 parts per million (ppm) in 2018 from 404.1 in 2017, stoked largely by human burning of fossil fuels. And the average global temperature in the past five years was 1.1C (2.0F) above pre-industrial times, it said. According to a U.N. climate report last year, temperatures will rise 1.5C above pre-industrial times by mid-century on current trends - bringing the prospect of even more extreme weather. That U.N. report said governments would have to make unprecedented cuts in greenhouse gases to keep temperatures below the 1.5C rise, which is the toughest goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Almost 200 nations agreed a “rule book” to govern the Paris accord in talks in Poland last month, even though critics said it was insufficient to prevent dangerous climate change. The Paris accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century by shifting to cleaner energies such as wind and solar power. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out and instead promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry. The Copernicus report confirms projections by the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November that 2018 would be fourth warmest. The WMO will issue its own estimate for 2018 temperatures in coming weeks, also comprising data compiled by U.S., British and Japanese agencies.

" Two people died and another four were missing on Monday after a ship carrying coal sent a distress signal off the northern coast of Turkey, the coast guard and the local governor’s office said. The Panama-flagged vessel, which departed from Russia’s Azov port, sent out a distress signal around 148 kilometres (92 miles) off the northeastern Black Sea province of Samsun, the coast guard said. Thirteen crew members were on the bulk carrier including nine Ukraine nationals, two Azerbaijan nationals and two Russians, the Samsun governor’s office said. The coast guard said the distress signal was received regarding a “possible sinking” of the ship. Seven members of the crew had been rescued so far while a search and rescue operation continued for the other four, the coast guard said. The operation was being carried out by a plane, two helicopters and two boats, it said, adding that one airforce helicopter was also joining as back-up.

" Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament later this month, despite little sign that she has won over sceptical lawmakers. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but May’s inability so far to get her deal for a managed exit through parliament has alarmed business leaders and investors who fear the country is heading for a damaging no-deal Brexit. May said the vote in parliament would be around Jan. 15, as expected, contrary to reports she could delay it. May has already delayed the vote once, in December, when it became clear she would lose unless extra reassurances from the EU were agreed. Describing what would happen if she was defeated, May told the BBC: “We’re going to be in uncharted territory. I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we’ll see in parliament.” Amid the uncertainty over Britain’s next steps - which range from leaving without a deal to not leaving at all - a poll showed more Britons want to remain a member of the EU than leave, and voters want to make the final decision themselves. May’s party itself is divided over her deal, with many fearing that an insurance policy designed to avoid the re-emergence of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely. One of those leading that opposition, lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, said in a newspaper article that it was “wishful thinking” that time away from parliament over the Christmas holiday could persuade him to change his mind and back the deal. The Northern Irish party that props up May’s minority government called on her to stand firm in demanding that the EU changes its “poison” backstop provision on Ireland’s post-Brexit border. With the parliamentary debate on her deal due to begin on Jan. 9, May said there was still work to do to get reassurances over the backstop from the EU. She also promised parliament would have a greater say in the rest of the Brexit process and warned that rejecting her deal could prevent Britain’s exit. “Don’t let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good, because the danger there is actually we end up with no Brexit at all,” May said. She did not answer whether she would, if defeated, make a second attempt to get the deal passed by parliament. May also did not directly respond, when asked, if she was leading the country toward a no-deal Brexit. On Tuesday, her government could face a bid to block an unmanaged exit when a group of lawmakers try to amend budget legislation to deny funding for some no-deal preparations unless they are approved by parliament. It is unclear yet whether the amendment has enough support to pass. May repeated her objections to holding a fresh public vote on the deal. She said a second referendum would be divisive, and also highlighted the lack of time available to hold a new referendum. “Practically, actually you couldn’t get a referendum in time before the 29th of March - you’d be talking about extending Article 50,” she said, referring to the two-year exit notice Britain sent to the EU in March 2017.",0
" Prime Minister Theresa May must win a vote in parliament to get her Brexit deal approved or risk seeing Britain’s exit from the European Union descend into chaos. May postponed a parliamentary vote on her deal last month, admitting she was set to lose it, instead pledging to seek assurances from the EU to help win over lawmakers. The vote is now due to take place the week beginning Jan. 14. To win, May and her ministers will have to overcome opposition from across the political spectrum and defeat attempts to alter or delay the Brexit process or derail it altogether. Here’s how the voting will work: The debate takes place in the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons. May does not have an outright majority of the 650 lawmakers, and the DUP, the small Northern Irish party that usually props up her government, is opposed to the deal. May needs 318 votes to get a deal through parliament as seven Sinn Fein lawmakers do not sit, four speakers do not vote and the four tellers are not counted. Parliament held three days of debate in December before the vote was postponed. The debate is scheduled to restart next Wednesday. The government will propose a timetable for how many days it should last and when the vote will be. So far the government has set out plans to hold the debate on Jan. 9 and 10. It has also proposed continuing the debate on Jan. 11, although parliament is not due to sit that day. The December debate was scheduled to last five days, so the restarted debate is expected to continue into the week of Jan. 14, when the government has said the vote will be held. Each day can last up to eight hours, with start and finish times will vary from day to day. On the final day, there will be a series of votes: first, to approve or reject up to six amendments to the government’s motion, and then to approve or reject the motion. It is not yet clear what time the voting will start. The debate will be on whether to approve a motion stating that parliament has approved the Withdrawal Agreement - a legal text setting out the terms of departure - and a separate political declaration outlining the long-term relationship Britain will have with the EU. Lawmakers are able to put forward amendments to this motion. John Bercow, the Speaker of the House, chooses no more than six of these on the final day, and they will be voted on unless the proposers opt to withdraw them. If approved, an amendment would be included in final motion’s wording. While any successful amendments would not bind the government to comply with them, they would be politically hard to ignore, and could dictate May’s next steps. Ministers have expressed concerns that if any amendment is passed by parliament, it could prevent the deal being ratified because the final vote may not then provide the legally necessary clear and unequivocal approval of May’s deal. The amendments will be voted on before the deciding ballot on whether to approve the overall motion - meaning May has to win a series of votes, rather than just one, each with the potential to scupper her plan. Once the debate is finished, the speaker will typically ask those in favour of each amendment to shout “aye”, and then those against to say “no”. As long as some lawmakers shout “no”, the speaker will call a formal vote, known as a division. Votes are registered by lawmakers walking through different doorways, out of sight of television cameras and onlookers. Once the headcount is complete - which can take up to 15 minutes - lawmakers return to the debating chamber. Four appointed tellers will assemble in front of the speaker, and one will read the result out loud. Once all the amendments have been voted upon, the main motion is put to a vote using the same process. By law, if the deal is rejected, ministers have 21 days to state how they intend to proceed. The government has previously said that if the agreement is rejected, Britain will leave the EU without a deal on March 29. The reality is that the huge uncertainty in the world’s fifth largest economy and the likely adverse reaction of financial markets would demand a much quicker political reaction. Some media have reported May would ask parliament to vote again on the deal. With 117 of her party’s 317 lawmakers having voted against her in a confidence vote in December, she is also likely to come under pressure to resign.",0
" English football star Wayne Rooney was arrested in December at Dulles Airport outside Washington, D.C. for public intoxication, local police said on Sunday. Rooney, who has played for U.S. soccer team D.C. United since last year, was booked into the Loudoun County Adult Detention Center on Dec. 16, on a charge of public intoxication stemming from an arrest by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police, the local sheriff’s office said. The 33-year-old footballer was arrested at an international arrivals gate at Dulles after he triggered a door alarm but did not breach airport security, a Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority spokesman said in a statement. He received a $25 fine, according to court documents. Rooney was released later the same day on a personal recognizance bond, said Kraig Troxell, a spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office. It was not immediately clear why authorities had delayed releasing details of Rooney’s arrest for more than two weeks. Rooney’s agent did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the player was quoted by British media as saying he was “disorientated” after mixing sleeping pills with alcohol during a flight from Saudi Arabia. D.C. United said it was aware of the reports of Rooney’s arrest. “We understand the media’s interest in this matter but believe this is a private matter for Wayne that D.C. United will handle internally,” the club said in a statement obtained by the Washington Post. D.C. United did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rooney, England’s former captain and all-time top scorer, joined the Major League Soccer club in mid-2018 in a deal that was reportedly worth more than $12 million and made him the highest paid player in D.C. United’s history. Liverpool-born Rooney was the latest addition to an elite list of former England captains to cross the Atlantic, following David Beckham and Steven Gerrard. Rooney burst into the consciousness of English soccer when he made his Premier League debut for Everton at age 16. He joined Manchester United for $35 million in 2004 and stayed there for 13 seasons - winning five English titles, one Champions League, one FA Cup, three League Cups and becoming the club’s all-time leading scorer with 253 goals. He earned 119 caps for England - a national record for an outfield player - and in 2015 he surpassed Manchester United great Bobby Charlton’s England goalscoring record, ending his international career with 53 goals for his country.",0
" France on Monday condemned an attempted coup in its former colony Gabon and called on its citizens in the capital Libreville to avoid moving around the city. “We condemn any attempt to change government outside constitutional rules,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a statement. “Gabon’s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution.” She added that it had called on the 8,900 French citizens registered in the country to avoid moving around Libreville.",0
" German government officials called on Monday for a tightening of data security laws after a far-reaching breach exposed the documents of hundreds of politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel. The leader of the opposition Greens party said he had cancelled his Twitter and Facebook accounts following the data breach, one of the largest ever in privacy-conscious Germany. Stephan Mayer, state secretary in the Interior Ministry, said authorities were working around the clock to investigate the breach, and would provide more details around mid-week. Mayer reiterated that government networks had not been breached, but said the ministry was working to tighten the cyber security of critical infrastructure and would also beef up the federal cyber security centre leading the current investigation. “One bit of positive news is that government networks are apparently not affected by this or these hacker attacks. But it’s clear that we as the federal government ... must do more to improve cyber security,” he said. German police on Sunday searched the apartment of Jan Schuerlein, a 19-year-old IT worker in the southern city of Heilbronn. Schuerlein said on Twitter he was being treated as a witness in the investigation given his contact with “0rbit”, the holder of a Twitter account that was used to publish the data but has since been shut down. Schuerlein said he was cooperating with police, according to broadcaster rbb, which first reported the police search. Little is known about the user “0rbit”. A spokesman for state prosecutors declined to comment on Sunday’s raid, but said the investigation was continuing. Justice Minister Katarina Barley and Germany’s digital coordinator, Dorothea Baer, also called on Monday for tougher social media controls following the data breach, which began in December but initially went largely unnoticed. “Such an attack must be used as a reason to very carefully examine if everything has been done to achieve the best possible security of data,” Baer told the Handelsblatt newspaper. “It is legitimate to examine whether software manufacturers and platforms must be required to do more to ensure data security,” she told the paper, without providing any details. Robert Habeck, leader of the Greens, said he had cancelled his Twitter account after he spoke disparagingly about the eastern German state of Thuringia in a video tweet. He said the medium caused him to be “more aggressive” than he would otherwise be. Habeck said he was also deleting his Facebook account because it was the main tool used to spread private data published as a result of the breach, including chats with his family members. No comment was immediately available from Twitter. Facebook declined to comment on the data breach issue.",0
" Japan’s Sumire Nakamura will become the youngest professional player of the ancient board game Go when she makes her debut as a 10-year-old on April 1. Nakamura, who will turn 10 on March 2 local media said, started playing the game with her father when she was three. The previous youngest player was Rina Fujisawa, who was 11 when she turned professional in 2010. Presented to the media on Saturday standing next to her father Shinya, himself a national champion, Nakamura said she was keen to get her first trophy. “I feel happy when I win,” said Nakamura, who currently goes to school in Osaka. “I want to win a title while I am in junior high school.” Her father was surprised at how quickly she entered the pro ranks. “I didn’t expect she will be professional this soon,” he said. “I think she was able to achieve this thanks to teachers who have taught her how to play Go and people that have supported her.” Go, most popular in East Asia, involves two players moving black and white stones across a square grid, aiming to seize the most territory. Its origins are said to date back thousands of years.",0
" British citizens will not need to leave Germany if their country leaves the European Union without an exit deal, an interior ministry spokesman said. British citizens will retain their residence rights for a three months period, with further extensions possible, the spokesman said, adding that during that time, they would have to register to acquire a formal right to remain. A transport ministry spokeswoman said Germany was in close contact with Britain with a view to avoiding disruption to air transport links in the case of a disordered Brexit.",0

" Taliban insurgents have stormed security posts in west Afghanistan, killing 21 police and pro-government militia members, officials said on Monday, the latest in a surge of attacks that has cast doubt on tentative steps towards talks. The Taliban attacked the checkpoints in two different parts of Badghis province, which is on the border with Turkmenistan, late on Sunday, provincial officials said. Abdul Aziz Bek, head of the Badghis provincial council, said 14 policemen and seven members of pro-government militias were killed, while nine were injured. A second government official, Jamshid Shahabi, a spokesman for the Badghis provincial governor, said more than 15 Taliban militants were killed and 10 wounded in the clashes. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks, among the most deadly in the province in many months. Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, said in statement they killed 34 members of the security forces and pro-government militias and seized many weapons and ammunition. Leaders of the hardline Islamist group and the U.S. officials are scheduled to meet this month to discuss the withdrawal of foreign forces and a possible ceasefire. Officials from the warring sides have met at least three times in recent months to try to agree on a way to end the 17-year war. But in the meantime, both sides are keeping up their attacks. The Taliban say they are fighting to topple the Western-backed government and restore strict Islamic law after their ouster in 2001. The United States and its allies say they want to stop Afghanistan from becoming a haven for international Islamist militants plotting attacks in the West. In a separate incident on Monday, at least five civilians were killed and eight wounded in a bomb blast in the eastern province of Paktika. The Taliban left the bomb in a village square, said provincial official Mohammad Rasoul Adel. A Taliban spokesman was not immediately available for comment.",0
" Bangladesh police said on Monday they have arrested 10 men, including a ruling party worker, in connection with the alleged gang rape of a woman who voted for the main opposition group in a controversial general election last month. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ruling alliance, led by the Awami League, won more than 90 percent of the seats contested in the Dec. 30 election that was marred by accusations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 19 people. The United Nations said on Friday that there were “worrying indications” that reprisals have continued to take place, notably against the political opposition. The Awami League denied the charges and said it did not believe in “politics of revenge”. Police said medical examination of the woman has confirmed sexual assault and police said they were also investigating complaints of threats against her family following the arrests over the past few days. The Awami League said it has already suspended the main accused, Ruhul Amin, from the party. Reuters could not contact Amin’s family. The woman’s husband told Reuters that a group of 10-12 men barged into their house in the southeastern district of Noakhali on the night of the election, tied up him and his four children inside the house, and raped her outside one by one. The husband said she was raped because she voted for the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. “We could not do anything,” the husband said from her hospital bedside, adding that he had received threats on his phone to withdraw the complaint with police.",0
" Members of Malaysia’s royal families agreed on Monday to vote for a new king on Jan. 24 to replace King Muhammad V, who has stepped down unexpectedly, the national news agency Bernama reported. The king resigned on Sunday after just two years on the throne, the first time a monarch has stepped down before completing their five-year tenure. No reason was given for the resignation. King Muhammad, 49, had only just resumed duties last week after spending two months on medical leave. Images purporting to show him getting married in Russia appeared on social media in December. Posts identified his new wife as Oksana Voevodina, who won a Miss Moscow contest in 2015. The palace has not responded to requests for comment on the photos or reports of a marriage. Media has also reported some tension between the palace and the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad since the veteran leader returned to power last year. Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy and the king assumes a largely ceremonial role, including acting as custodian of Islam in the Muslim-majority country. The king’s assent is needed for the appointment of a prime minister and various senior officials. Malaysia’s nine royal households take turns to provide a king, who is chosen through a vote in a Council of Rulers, made up of the nine households, most of which are led by a sultan. A vote must be held within four weeks of the throne becoming vacant. Heads of six of the nine households met on Monday at the national palace to decide a date for the election of a new king. The council agreed that a new king would be voted in on Jan. 24, and would formally take the throne on Jan. 31, the council said in a statement posted on the Bernama Twitter feed. One sultan could not attend as he was unwell, while another was overseas, the council said. The third sultan who was not present was King Muhammad. Earlier on Monday, Mahathir said the government hoped the council would elect a new king as soon as possible as the government needed to keep the king apprised on “certain matters”, Bernama reported. Mahathir led the opposition to a historic election win in May, defeating a coalition that had governed Malaysia for 60 years. In June, the government and palace faced a near two-week impasse over a plan to appoint someone how was not from the majority ethnic Malay community as attorney-general. The king eventually approved the appointment, though the incident had stoked ethnic tensions. Mahathir, known for challenging royalty during his earlier 22-year tenure as prime minister, said in a blog post last week that everyone “from the Rulers to the Prime Minister and Ministers, to the civil servants and ordinary citizens” are subject to the law. He did not elaborate.",0

" WikiLeaks on Sunday advised journalists not to report 140 different “false and defamatory” statements about its founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June 2012. It was not immediately clear what prompted the advice to media organisations, but WikiLeaks singled out Britain’s Guardian newspaper for publishing what it said was a false report about Assange. The Guardian did not immediately respond late on Sunday to a Reuters request for comment. The Australian set up WikiLeaks as a channel for publishing confidential information from anonymous sources. He is a hero to some for exposing what supporters cast as government abuse of power and for championing free speech, but to others he is a rebel who has undermined the security of the United States. WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family. “There is a pervasive climate of inaccurate claims about WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, including purposeful fabrications planted in large and otherwise ‘reputable’ media outlets,” Wikileaks said an email sent to media organisations and marked “Confidential legal communication. Not for publication.” “Consequently journalists and publishers have a clear responsibility to carefully fact-check from primary sources and to consult the following list to ensure they are not spreading, and have not spread, defamatory falsehoods about WikiLeaks or Julian Assange.” WikiLeaks did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The 5,000-word email included 140 statements that WikiLeaks said were false and defamatory, such as the assertion that Assange had ever been an “agent or officer of any intelligence service”. WikiLeaks also said it was false and defamatory to suggest that Assange, 47, had ever been employed by the Russian government or that he is, or has ever been, close to the Russian state, the Kremlin or Putin. Other items listed as false and defamatory included more personal claims including that Assange bleaches his hair, that he is a hacker, that he has ever neglected an animal or that he has poor personal hygiene. Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff. Later that year, the group released over 90,000 secret documents detailing the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, followed by almost 400,000 internal U.S. military reports detailing operations in Iraq. More than 250,000 classified cables from U.S. embassies followed, then almost 3 million dating back to 1973.",0
" The Palestinian Authority said on Sunday it had ordered its employees to pull out from the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, effectively closing the main exit point from the impoverished Gaza Strip. The dispute over the border stems from a rift between the PA, based in the occupied West Bank and headed by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and the Islamist militant group Hamas, which took control of Gaza more than a decade ago in a civil war. Re-opening the Rafeh crossing, which according to human rights groups is the sole exit point from Gaza for an estimated 95 percent of its 2 million population, will require Egypt to agree on a new operator. It is unclear whether it will allow Hamas to run the passage. Cairo has not so far commented on the situation. PA employees were deployed to Gaza’s border crossings with Israel and Egypt in 2017 under Egyptian mediation in what was seen as the first concrete step towards ending the dispute. The PA said Sunday’s decision to pull out from the crossing was a response to Hamas undermining its operations and detaining some of its workers. “After Hamas’s insistence on bolstering division ... and the questioning, detention and suppression of our employees, we have become convinced it is useless to maintain our presence there,” it said. The decision takes effect on Monday, though the crossing was already scheduled to be closed until Tuesday due to a holiday. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters the closure of the border amounted to “additional sanctions by Abbas against the people of Gaza”. “This is a blow to... Egypt, which had overseen the handover of the crossings as part of the implementation of the reconciliation deal that Abbas has destroyed,” he said. Poverty is rampant in Gaza due to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade and three armed confrontations with Israel since 2008, as well as the internal rivalry. Israel says its restrictions are to stop weapons entering the territory. The two Palestinian groups have tried and failed numerous times to end their dispute. Officials from Abbas’s Fatah movement said Hamas-led security forces have detained nearly 400 of their supporters and activists in Gaza in recent days, while Hamas said dozens of their men were detained by the PA in the West Bank.

" President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi inaugurated Egypt’s largest church and mosque in the New Administrative Capital on Sunday, the eve of Coptic Christmas, in a message of tolerance in the predominantly Muslim country. Copts, the largest Christian minority in the Middle East, were due hold a midnight mass in the Cathedral of the Nativity, billed by the government as the Middle East’s largest church, a few hours after the inauguration. Coptic Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of Egypt’s nearly 100 million people and have long complained of discrimination under laws that favour Muslims. They have also increasingly been targeted in recent years by Islamist militants including Islamic State, which is waging an insurgency in the north of the remote Sinai Peninsula. Foreign dignitaries and officials including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Arab League Chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit flanked Sisi at the opening, state television showed. Angham, a prominent local singer, sang for Muslim-Christian coexistence as a display of fireworks lit the skies over the two houses of worship. “This is an important moment in our history,” Sisi said in a speech as he opened the cathedral. “We are one and we will remain one,” he added, referring to Egyptian Christians and Muslims. “On this day we see you have fulfilled this promise and here we are witnessing a great opening on this grand occasion,” the head of the Coptic church Pope Tawadros II said. He will preside over midnight mass later in the evening with Sisi in attendance. U.S. President Donald Trump also praised the opening of the church and the mosque. “Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President Al-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. The Cathedral of the Nativity, adorned with Coptic icons, can accommodate more than 8,000 worshippers while the al-Fattah al-Aleem Mosque can hold nearly double the number. Both are located in the new administrative capital, a major development located some 45 km (28 miles) east of Cairo. Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, Grand Imam of the al-Azhar Mosque, said Islam obliges Muslims to safeguard and defend houses of worship, whether Muslim, Christian or Jewish. Contractors have been clearing debris from the perimeter of the cathedral in the last two weeks in preparation for its grand opening. The new Egyptian capital, announced in March 2015, is intended partly to reduce crowding in Cairo but will also be home to government ministries and an airport. The government is expecting to begin moving to the new premises later this year.

" Chinese authorities have arrested the founder and more than a dozen others at a local traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) firm after the death of a young girl with cancer was linked to the company and sparked anger online. Authorities in the Chinese port city of Tianjin had said in December that they were investigating TCM firm Quanjian Group over allegations including false marketing. The official local Tianjin Daily reported on Monday that police has arrested Quanjian founder Shu Yuhui and 17 others. The story was widely picked up by national state media. An official at the Wuqing office of the Tianjin Administration for Market Regulation confirmed the arrests to Reuters but declined to comment further. An employee in Quanjian’s customer service department told Reuters that authorities were dealing with the matter but declined to provide further comment on the arrests. Reuters could not reach Shu for comment. Quanjian, headquartered in the northeastern city of Tianjin, has been under fire after an article recounting the death of a four-year-old girl from cancer went viral on social media. The girl had received a treatment from the firm. Chinese people expressed anger over the case and shared their own experiences about how the company overstated the efficacy of its treatments. Some criticized Quanjian for operating a pyramid scheme for sales. Operators of pyramid schemes typically make money by recruiting members, who pay fees to act as salespeople of goods, rather than relying on the sale of the goods themselves. Founded in 2004, Quanjian has expanded into an empire with billions of yuan in sales and many hospitals and stores, local media reported. The company says it also owns sports clubs. The Quanjian case has become one of the most widely discussed health cases since it went viral in late 2018, underscoring public concern over medical problems in China that range from a lack of doctors to slow approvals for new drugs. The case also has echoes of an incident in 2016 when the death of a student drew attention to misleading advertising after he used search engine Baidu Inc to look for treatment for his rare form of cancer. That prompted a major probe into healthcare advertising and led to a drop in Baidu’s earnings.",0
" China said on Monday it would welcome U.N. officials to its far western region of Xinjiang if they follow the proper procedures, amid global concern over Beijing’s de-radicalisation programme there. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kangm asked at a regular briefing about reports that China had invited UN experts to Xinjiang, said that all parties, including the U.N., were welcome, as long as they respected appropriate travel procedures. U.N. officials should also “avoid interfering in domestic matters” and adopt an objective and neutral attitude, he added. The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, in December said her office was seeking access to Xinjiang to verify “worrying reports” of re-education camps holding Muslim minorities, including the Turkic speaking Uighurs. In August, a U.N. human rights panel said it had received credible reports that a million or more Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang were being held in what resembled a “massive internment camp”. In a rare move, a group of 15 Western ambassadors in Beijing, spearheaded by Canada, have sought a meeting with the top official in the region, Communist Party boss Chen Quanguo, for an explanation of alleged rights abuses against Uighurs. Beijing has launched an increasingly active publicity campaign to defend its actions in Xinjiang in the face of an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts. In the last two weeks, the Chinese government has arranged for diplomats from 12 non-Western countries to visit the region, as well as organising a trip for a small group of reporters, including Reuters, to three facilities, which it called vocational education training centres. In the centres, Uighur students learned in Mandarin about the dangers of extremist thought and sang and danced for reporters, including a rendition in English of “If You’re Happy and You Know it, Clap Your Hands”. Xinjiang officials told Reuters on the trip that the de-radicalisation programme had been highly successful but that fewer people would be sent through the system in future. Reuters last year reported on harsh extrajudicial detentions and interrogations at the camps, which are at odds with Beijing's claims, and took pictures of guard towers and barbed wire surrounding some.

" A court in southern China has put a man to death after he injured 12 children in a knife attack at a kindergarten, the state broadcaster said on Monday. Violent crime is rare in China but there has been a series of knife and axe attacks in recent years, many targeting children. China Central Television said that in January 2017 Qin Pengan stabbed the children with a vegetable knife in order to extract revenge for his life not going as he wanted and a dispute with a neighbour. SPONSORED None of the children died from their injuries. A local court in Pingxiang city in south China’s Guangxi province sentenced Qin to death, and the sentence was carried out on Friday after being approved by the China’s Supreme People’s Court, the broadcaster said. Despite efforts to reduce the number of people executed every year, China still puts more people to death every year than any other country, according to estimates from rights groups. A Supreme People’s Court judge in December made a rare defence of the death penalty, saying that China could not abolish the system for fear of angering a public that overwhelmingly supports its use.",0
" U.S. State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday. U.S. officials discussed the schedule for the second Trump-Kim summit while in contact with North Korean officials in the Vietnamese capital city, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event, the Munhwa Ilbo reported, citing unnamed diplomatic sources in Seoul and Washington. Vietnam has diplomatic relations with both the United States and North Korea, with North Korea maintaining a diplomatic office in Vietnam, and has the symbolic significance of a communist country that has reformed its economy, the newspaper reported. A spokesperson for the U.S Embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Sunday, Trump told reporters in Washington that the United States and North Korea are “negotiating a location” for a second summit. “It will be announced probably in the not too distant future,” Trump said. “They do want to meet and we want to meet and we’ll see what happens.” While the two sides had “a very good dialogue” and the American president had “indirectly” communicated with Kim, Trump said sanctions would be enforced until more progress is made. In a nationally televised New Year address, Kim said he is willing to meet Trump again anytime to achieve their common goal of denuclearising the Korean Peninsula, but warned he may have to take an alternative path if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued. “I am always ready to sit together with the U.S. president anytime in the future, and will work hard to produce results welcomed by the international community without fail,” Kim said.",0
" German federal police on Sunday searched the apartment of a 19-year-old IT worker in the Southern city of Heilbronn as part of investigations into a far-reaching data breach, broadcaster rbb said on Monday. Police searched the apartment and household rubbish of Jan Schuerlein, who it currently being treated as a witness, and took away technical devices, rbb said, citing security sources. SPONSORED Germany’s government said on Friday that personal data and documents from hundreds of politicians and public figures, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, had been published online in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. According to rbb, Schuerlein previously said on Twitter he had been in touch with user “0rbit”, who is suspected to have committed the data breach via a Twitter account which has been shut down. Schuerlein on Twitter posted a screenshot of an online chat he had with “0rbit” on Jan. 4, in which the latter said he would destroy his own computer equipment. Schuerlein told journalists he cooperated with police, rbb said.",0
" Turkish prosecutors ordered the detention of 100 soldiers over suspected links to the network of the U.S.-based Muslim cleric accused of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016, state-owned media said on Monday. The detentions were the result of investigations into pay phone communications between alleged members of cleric Fethullah Gulen’s network, Anadolu said. It said the detentions were in progress. Police have conducted a steady stream of raids against Gulen’s alleged supporters since the July 2016 coup attempt, in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies involvement. SPONSORED More than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial, while 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs as part of the post-coup purges. Widespread operations are still routine. Rights groups and Turkey’s Western allies have voiced concerns over the scale of the crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan has used the abortive putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. The government, however, has said the security measures were necessary due to the gravity of the threat Turkey faces.",0
" An 18-year-old Saudi woman who says she is fleeing family abuse barricaded herself inside her transit hotel room at Bangkok airport to avoid being sent home by Thai authorities, a rights group said on Monday. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun was scheduled to be sent on a Kuwait Airways flight to Kuwait City, where her family is, on Monday morning. “She has barricaded herself in the room & says she will not leave” until she is allowed to meet the U.N. refugee agency and claim asylum, Human Rights Watch’s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said on Twitter. Qunun was refused entry on Saturday by Thai immigration officials. Thai authorities deny acting at the request of the Saudi government and say she did not have the correct documents for a visa on arrival.

" In the poor, hot region of Guatemala that was home to a seven-year-old migrant girl before she died in U.S. border custody last month, palm oil cultivation is taking over from subsistence farming, adding to pressure on people to leave. Many villagers around the municipality of Raxruha have sold land to palm oil producers, residents and local officials say, helping to make Guatemala one of the world’s biggest exporters of the versatile product in the space of just a few years. Supporters of the industry say it has created jobs and investment in an area where poverty and violence have long been the main drivers of migration. But critics say farmers have given up land that long fed them, with many then entering a state of co-dependency with palm oil companies that have become major employers, but do not pay well enough to stop people migrating. Cesar Castro, Raxruha’s mayor, said money raised from land sales had been used to pay people smugglers, a major factor in a surge in families leaving Guatemala. “These people get the money, and they go to the United States, and the vast majority come back to find more poverty and end up employed as workers on their own land,” Castro said. More than 50,000 Guatemalans were apprehended in family groups at the U.S.-Mexico border in the 2018 fiscal year, more than double the year before, U.S. government data shows. Most get deported. Jakelin Caal, who died in U.S. custody after succumbing to a fever, left Raxruha with her father because he was struggling to earn enough to support his family as a corn farmer, relatives said. Smugglers tell families that having children with them can make it easier to enter the United States. While her father had not sold his land, others in the family have worked on palm plantations that surround their village. “The work’s a killer,” said Dorrian Caal, Jakelin’s uncle. “You have to get up at 3 a.m. and you get home at 10 at night, and with the little you’re paid, it’s not enough.” Dorrian said he earned 60 quetzales ($7.80) a day working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. last year for local producer Industria Chiquibul, which has been listed as a supplier by international commodities purchasers including ADM and Cargill . That would be below the 90 quetzales stipulated as the daily minimum wage for the agricultural sector in 2018. The National Council for Displaced People of Guatemala, a labour rights group, lodged a complaint with Cargill about the wages in 2016. Local farmer Jose Maria Ical said the company agreed to raise its wages to 91 quetzales after repeated workers’ complaints. Chiquibul did not reply to repeated requests for comment on this article. Questioned on Chiquibul, ADM said it set high standards for its suppliers of palm oil, without making any specific reference to the company in its reply. “We take violations of our policies very seriously, and thoroughly investigate any allegations and take appropriate actions as a result of those findings,” ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said. Cargill said it “works closely with our suppliers to ensure all palm supply chain practices support the United Nations’ goals to provide people with decent work. When issues are identified, we hold ourselves and our palm suppliers responsible through a formal code of conduct to respond to concerns and set time-bound action plans to address them.” Used in foodstuffs, detergents and fuels, palm oil is mostly produced in Indonesia and Malaysia, where environmental groups are worried that its planting has caused deforestation and habitat destruction. In the past few years, Guatemala has become the biggest exporter in the Americas, according to Guatemalan palm oil industry association Grepalma. Exports leapt almost seven-fold in the last ten years to 727,000 tonnes in 2017. Over one seventh of the area under cultivation in Guatemala is in Alta Verapaz, the remote, forested region where Raxruha lies. Traversed by dirt streets without sidewalks or drains, the town is peopled by children and adults that sometimes walk barefoot, often living in cramped thatched dwellings. Farmer Ical related how he and others sold land to Chiquibul in 2010 in the Raxruha area when the firm purchased plots through intermediaries who said they were ranchers. But access was later blocked to farmers’ other allotments when Chiquibul’s land was fenced off, he said. “They virtually obliged me to sell,” Ical added. Most of those who sold now work for the industry, he said. Some see the arrival of the palm oil industry as a positive development. Darlyn Lemus, a 30-year-old teacher, said the firms had taken undue flak. “There’s been a lot of speculation the palm industry has forced them to sell, but it’s not like that, people have had their own reasons,” said Lemus, whose family is one of few in the area that have kept their lands. One palm oil company in Raxruha, NaturAceites, told Reuters most of the land it operates in Guatemala had been converted from “intensive cattle ranching.” Describing the industry as “the only chance of decent work there is in parts of the country,” Hector Herrera, NaturAceites’ director of sustainability, said the firm had created thousands of jobs, invested in roads, schools and health centres, and met all the labour standards required by law.",0
" The former Catholic priest of the Polish village of Kalinowka is serving three years in jail for molesting five schoolgirls. But Marta Zezula, a mother whose testimony helped convict him, says the priest’s victims are the ones made to feel guilty. “We are witches ... because we have pointed at the priest,” Zezula fumed as she shovelled straw into a chaff cutter in her barn in the tiny settlement in eastern Poland. Many parishioners believe she and other mothers of those molested “simply convicted an innocent man”, she said. Home to about 170 people, Kalinowka is a short drive from the main road, but feels more remote. The Holy Cross church, built in 1880, sits on a hill overlooking rolling farmland and forests full of deer. Krystyna Kluzniak, hurrying into the well-kept church on a chilly November evening, said people should give the jailed priest a break. “The priest was cool and we miss him,” she said. The priest, who cannot be named under Polish law, is now on trial again, charged with molesting another child. His lawyer, Marek Tokarczyk, said he denies the allegations. “We need a fair trial,” Tokarczyk said. Similar scandals have shaken the Catholic Church and split communities in the United States, Ireland, Australia and elsewhere. But Poland is one of Europe’s most devout nations, where most people identify as Catholics and the Church is widely revered. Priests were active in the fight against communism and in 1989, led by a Polish pope, John Paul II, the Church helped overthrow Communist rule. Divisions over allegations of abuse are particularly stark here, said Marek Lisinski, the director of “Have no fear”, a group that advocates for victims of clerical abuse. Parishioners often side with priests and ostracise victims and their families, Lisinski told Reuters. In October, “Have no fear” published a map that revealed the scale of the issue. It used black crosses to mark places where 60 priests had been convicted of abuses dating back to 1956. Afterwards, Lisinski said, people called in to report another 300 cases of suspected abuse by priests which they had not raised with the Church or police for fear they would be doubted or shunned. The same month, a Polish court of appeal upheld a landmark ruling which granted a million zloty ($260,000) in compensation to a woman abused by a priest as a child. Jaroslaw Gluchowski, a lawyer in Poznan who represents victims of clerical abuse, said the ruling set an important precedent. “We’re now at a moment when all victims in Poland are realizing that they’re not alone,” he said. In a November statement, Poland’s bishops asked victims of clerical abuse for forgiveness and said the Church had begun collecting data to “identify the causes of these deeds and assess their scale”. Archbishop Wojciech Polak, the primate of Poland, told Reuters the Church will publish its findings within six months. Polak encouraged victims of clerical abuse to talk to their bishops, who are “obliged to report to the prosecutors’ service all credible cases they get knowledge of”. He said he was aware the issue had caused rifts in some communities. “It is the Church’s responsibility to act in a way that doesn’t create divisions but heals them,” he said. Senior bishops from around the world will meet Pope Francis at a conference in the Vatican in February to discuss protection of minors. Conference organisers have said everyone must be held accountable or the Church risked losing credibility worldwide. The issue could also have political ramifications in Poland, Lisinski and other observers say. The country is due to elect a new parliament by December 2019. The Catholic Church has long played a major political role in Poland, making its 25,000 priests not only revered but also influential with voters. In December, a report appeared in Gazeta Wyborcza, a leading Polish daily, containing molestation allegations from a woman, Barbara Borowiecka, against the late priest Henryk Jankowski, an iconic figure in the anti-communist Solidarity movement. The mayor of Gdansk, the birthplace of Solidarity, asked the Church to investigate the allegations. Archbishop Polak told Reuters the Jankowski allegations “should be investigated for the good of the Church” and said it was up to bishop of Gdansk to address them. The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in 2015 with a blend of patriotism and piety that echoed the religious nationalism of the Church. In October, a former PiS minister, Antoni Macierewicz, credited the Polish clergy with helping the party win local elections that month. Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an MP for a small opposition party called Now, is seeking an independent inquiry into child abuse by priests because she says the Church cannot be relied upon to investigate itself. She says the idea has received no support from PiS or other big parties. A PiS spokesperson did not respond to several requests asking whether it supported the idea of an inquiry. Ryszard Czarnecki, a PiS MP for the European Parliament, responded to Reuters by asking why the Church should be singled out. “I don’t know why we are focusing on one group, as this also concerns different groups - for example, artistic or journalistic ones,” he said. About 12 million people, or almost a third of Poland’s population, regularly attend Mass, according to a survey by the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics, a Warsaw-based research centre. The numbers slightly declined from 2015 to 2016, the survey showed. Most children attend religious classes, but their numbers are dropping, too. In Lodz, Poland’s third-largest city, they fell from 80 percent in 2015 to fewer than 50 percent now, according to local government data quoted by the daily Dziennik Lodzki. In November, the Church said such trends could have dire consequences. “Abandoning the Catholic faith and the Christian principles governing our national life and state’s functioning” could lead to Poland’s collapse, it warned in a pastoral letter. In Kalinowka, Reuters spoke to seven parishioners. Most of them were sticking by the convicted priest. “I have a cousin whose son went to one of his classes and they didn’t see it,” Wieslaw Solowiej, a pensioner, said outside the Kalinowka church. Jolanta Zych, whose nine-year-old daughter was among those molested, said neighbours spurned the family. “I always greet people but some turn their faces from me,” said Zych. The other mother Reuters spoke to, Zezula, said her daughter began refusing food after the court case. “She didn’t want to eat because one woman told her the priest was in jail because of her.” During Mass, Zezula said, people shrank away or refused to shake hands during a ritual greeting known as the sign of peace. She no longer goes to church. Piotr Lenart, the current priest, referred questions to the Zamosc-Lubaczow Diocese in which the Kalinowka parish lies. Michal Maciolek, a priest and spokesman for the diocese, said it had offered the victims and their families pastoral and psychological help, but this had been rejected. No financial compensation was offered, because “the diocese can’t take responsibility for the priest’s actions”.

" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi offered a rare acknowledgement of his close security cooperation with Israel in the Sinai peninsula during a U.S. television interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” news programme broadcast on Sunday. The programme said Cairo had asked the network not to air the interview but did not give further details. Under Sisi, Egypt has quietly cooperated with Israel on security in Egypt’s Sinai, a desert peninsula demilitarized as part of a U.S.-sponsored 1979 peace treaty between the two countries but where Cairo’s forces now operate freely. Acknowledging such cooperation with Israel can be a sensitive topic in Egypt. Asked whether the cooperation was the closest and deepest that he has had with Israel, Sisi responded: “That is correct.” “The Air Force sometimes needs to cross to the Israeli side. And that’s why we have a wide range of coordination with the Israelis,” Sisi said, according to a transcript provided by CBS. Defeating militants in the Sinai and restoring security after years of unrest has been a key promise of Sisi, who was re-elected in March last year in a landslide victory against no real opposition. Islamist militants have been waging an insurgency for years in the north of the peninsula, which lacks basic infrastructure and job opportunities. In contrast, the region’s southern coast is peppered with Red Sea tourist resorts. Egyptian security forces have battled Islamist militants in the mainly desert region, stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, since 2013. Asked why he had not managed to wipe the militants out, Sisi responded by pointing to the difficulties that the United States has faced in Afghanistan against the Taliban insurgency. “Why hasn’t the U.S. eliminated the terrorists in Afghanistan after 17 years and spending a trillion dollars?” he asked. Sisi’s critics accuse him of cracking down on all dissent, but supporters say tough measures are needed to stabilise Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011. In his interview with “60 Minutes,” Sisi denied that Egypt was holding political prisoners. CBS cited one rights group’s estimate of 60,000 political prisoners. “I don’t know where they got that figure. I said there are no political prisoners in Egypt,” Sisi said. “Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology ... we have to intervene regardless of their numbers.”",0
" The French government has told Renault (RENA.PA) to provide more details on compensation paid to senior executives via a Dutch holding company jointly owned with alliance partner Nissan, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. Le Maire made the demand after France’s CGT trade Union voiced concerns over payments made to certain high-ranking executives via the alliance’s Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) Dutch venture and called for more transparency at the carmaker. Corporate governance inside the alliance has come under tight scrutiny after Japanese authorities arrested its chairman Carlos Ghosn in mid November on suspicion of under-reporting his income at Nissan (7201.T). The French state is Renault’s biggest shareholder. Le Maire told CNews television that the government had written to Renault’s leadership to “request all details necessary for full transparency on these compensation payments”. “I want to know who these payments were made to, if they were declared and therefore whether ... the Renault board was aware of them.” A Renault spokesman did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment. The Ghosn affair, sparked by a Nissan internal investigation, has rocked the auto industry, strained Nissan’s ties with Renault and complicated diplomatic relations between Japan and the France. A one-time titan of the auto industry, Ghosn, who has since been ousted as Nissan chairman, is also accused of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan. Ghosn denies all the charges against him. Renault board members including the French state’s representatives have yet to be given full access to Nissan’s findings against Ghosn, which have been shared with Renault’s lawyers. The restrictions are justified by judicial confidentiality, the company has said. Executives from both carmakers - including Renault General Secretary Mouna Sepehri, who oversees communications with the board - had looked at least twice at legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through RNBV or other shared finances, Reuters revealed last month. Those two efforts were ultimately abandoned. Immediately after Ghosn’s Nov. 19 arrest, however, Nissan told Renault privately it was extending its internal investigation to cover their Dutch-registered alliance holdings. Ghosn will make his first public appearance in seven weeks at a Tokyo court on Tuesday after he requested an open hearing for an explanation on his continued detention. Ghosn’s son, Anthony, told the Journal du Dimanche that Japanese prosecutors wanted his father to sign a confession..",0
" Chancellor Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), demanded on Sunday that her interior minister quickly find out what Germany’s security agencies knew about a huge data breach and how they reacted. The breach has shocked Germany’s establishment and risks rocking Merkel’s awkward ‘grand coalition’ again just months after a row over the fate of the domestic intelligence agency chief came close to tearing apart the ruling alliance. The government said on Friday that personal data and documents from hundreds of German politicians and public figures including Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the centre-left (SPD), told the Funke media group the government must quickly shed light on “which agencies knew what exactly when, and how that was dealt with”. “This should be a priority for (Interior Minister) Horst Seehofer. It’s about protecting our democracy,” Klingbeil added. Seehofer told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung he only became aware of the breach on Friday morning, but that he would share everything he finds out with the public and intended to do so by the middle of this week at the latest. The ecologist Greens leader in parliament, Anton Hofreiter, said the president of the BSI cyber defence agency, Arne Schoenbohm, must explain himself urgently in an extraordinary parliamentary committee meeting. The BSI on Saturday defended its role in responding to the data breach, saying it could not have connected individual cases it was aware of last year until the entire data release became public last week. Last year, Seehofer was at the centre of a political storm over another security agency chief, whose the fate almost tore apart Merkel’s coalition of her conservative bloc and the SPD. Despite SPD resistance, Seehofer rescued Hans-Georg Maassen from dismissal in September when the domestic spy chief questioned the authenticity of videos showing far-right nationalists chasing immigrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz. But Maassen was subsequently sacked in November over a speech given behind closed doors condemning “naive and leftist” government policies.

" Nigerian soldiers raided the offices of the country’s Daily Trust newspaper and arrested two of its journalists following an article about the military’s fight against Islamist militants in the northeast, the newspaper said on Sunday. The Daily Trust published photographs on its website of armed soldiers raiding its head office in the capital, Abuja. The newspaper also said the military had shut down its office in the northeastern city of Maiduguri after arresting a regional editor and a reporter. An uptick in attacks by Islamist militants in recent months has made security a key campaign issue ahead of the Feb. 16 presidential election in which Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term. The Nigerian army said in an emailed statement that the paper, in an article published on Sunday, had “divulged classified military information, thus undermining national security”. It said the journalists were arrested in order for them to realise the importance of national security and that the military did not intend to silence the press. The statement was issued hours after the presidency commented on the raids. “The Federal Government has directed the military to vacate the premises of @daily_trust and the order has been complied with,” the president’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said on Twitter. “Issues between the military and the newspaper as they affect the coverage of the war in the Northeast will be resolved through dialogue,” he added. Also on Twitter, the main opposition party’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, said press freedom was the bedrock of Nigeria’s democracy and “nothing should be done to compromise it”. The Islamist militant group Boko Haram has killed about 30,000 people since 2009 in an insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria. It was pushed out of most of the Belgium-sized swathe of territory it controlled in early 2015. But a faction that broke away in 2016 - Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) - has claimed responsibility in the past few months for a series of attacks on military bases and strategically located towns. The group attacked Baga - a town that borders Niger, Chad and Cameroon - in December, forcing hundreds to seek safety in Maiduguri, 200 km (125 miles) to the south. Opponents of Buhari - a military ruler in the 1980s who was voted into office in 2015 - have criticised his security record, pointing to such incidents and an attack on an army base in Metele, Borno state, in which about 100 soldiers were killed.",0
" Jamal al-Badawi, wanted by the United States for his suspected role in the attack on the USS Cole 18 years ago, was killed in a precision strike in Yemen on Jan. 1, U.S. Central Command said on Sunday. Badawi was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2003 over his role in the October 2000 deadly bombing of the USS Cole, a Navy guided-missile destroyer. He escaped from prison in Yemen twice, once in 2003 and again in 2006. “U.S. forces confirmed the results of the strike following a deliberate assessment process,” said Central Command spokesman Captain Bill Urban, two days after the Defense Department said U.S. forces had targeted Badawi in the strike. It is the latest blow to Yemen’s al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has lost key leaders in U.S strikes in recent years. In 2018, U.S. officials said they believed that Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, once one of the world’s most feared bombmakers, had been killed. Still, Katherine Zimmerman at the American Enterprise Institute conservative thinktank cautioned that AQAP had proven it will remain a threat. The group has benefited from the chaos of Yemen’s civil war, although it has lost major strongholds, including the port city of Mukallah. “There is certainly a degradation of the leadership,” Zimmerman said. “The big concern is that al Qaeda has always proven that its bench is much deeper and there is no clear strategy for stabilizing Yemen and setting the conditions where we don’t have a new generation (of militants) coming forward.” Yemen’s conflict has pushed it to the verge of famine, with millions relying on food aid. The death of Badawi removes perhaps the last major figure in the USS Cole attack from the battlefield. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: “Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole.” There was a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The Cole attack was a devastating blow to the U.S. Navy. On Oct. 12, 2000, two men in a small boat detonated explosives alongside the vessel as it was refuelling in Aden, killing 17 sailors, wounding more than three dozen others and blasting a gaping hole in its hull.",0
" Former Venezuelan Supreme Court Justice Christian Zerpa has fled to the United States to protest President Nicolas Maduro’s second term that will begin with his inauguration this week, the onetime Maduro backer told a Miami broadcaster on Sunday. The latest defection from the crisis-stricken OPEC nation’s government comes amid growing international pressure on Maduro over his new term, which resulted from a broadly boycotted 2018 vote dismissed by countries around the world as a sham. “I’ve decided to leave Venezuela to disavow the government of Nicolas Maduro,” Zerpa said in an interview with EVTV, which is broadcast over cable and the internet. “I believe (Maduro) does not deserve a second chance because the election he supposedly won was not free and competitive.” The Supreme Court confirmed in a statement that he had fled, referring to him as a former magistrate and adding it opened an investigation of him in November over accusations of sexual harassment by women in his office. The court’s leadership recommended that he be dismissed over the allegations, it said, without providing details. Zerpa was for years a crucial ally of Maduro on the Supreme Court, which has backed the ruling Socialist Party in every major legal dispute since Maduro’s 2013 election. He wrote a 2016 ruling that provided the legal justification for Maduro’s government to strip congress of most of its powers after the Socialist Party lost control of the body to the opposition in a landslide election. Zerpa in the interview described the Supreme Court as “an appendage of the executive branch,” and said that justices were at times summoned to the presidential palace to receive instructions on how to rule on certain sensitive cases. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zerpa said he did not criticise Maduro’s May 2018 election to make sure he could pave the way for a safe exit from the country in the company of his family. Opposition leaders have urged foreign governments not to recognise Maduro after his inauguration on Thursday, and a group of Latin American nations on Friday called on Maduro not to take office. But diplomats consulted by Reuters said few countries were likely to shutter embassies or sever ties with Venezuela. Zerpa’s words echoed those of former Justice Eladio Aponte, who fled to the United States in 2012 and said the government of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez - Maduro’s predecessor - systematically manipulated court affairs. here MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" White House national security adviser John Bolton added a new condition on Sunday to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies. President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to announce a U.S. pullout from Syria left many questions open, chiefly whether Kurdish fighters who had been operating in northern Syria alongside U.S. forces would now be attacked by their long-time enemy, Turkey. Bolton, on a trip to Israel and Turkey, said he would stress in talks with Turkish officials, including President Tayyip Erdogan, that Kurdish forces must be protected. Ahead of talks with Israeli officials, he told reporters the pullout would be done in a way that guaranteed the Islamic State jihadist group “is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again.” And it would be carried out in such a way as to “make sure that the defence of Israel and our other friends in the region is absolutely assured, and to take care of those who have fought with us against ISIS and other terrorist groups.” Asked whether a U.S. withdrawal would not take place in Syria until Turkey guaranteed the Kurdish fighters would be safe, Bolton said: “Basically, that’s right.” The Syrian YPG militia has been highly effective in the war against Islamic State, a part of the wider Syrian conflict pitting a range of insurgent groups against President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and sometimes against each other. But Turkey has long castigated Washington for its military relationship with the YPG. Ankara regards the YPG an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish armed group that has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey for over three decades. “We don’t think the Turks ought to undertake military action that’s not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum,” Bolton said, “so they don’t endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president’s requirement that the Syrian opposition forces that have fought with us are not endangered.” The YPG has indicated that it might seek a deal with Damascus after the U.S. forces have gone. Bolton, who will travel to Turkey on Monday, said the United States would talk to Ankara to find out what its objectives and capabilities were. Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey’s targets were the YPG, the PKK and Islamic State. “One aim of Turkey’s fight against the PKK and its Syrian extensions is to rescue the Kurds from the cruelty and oppression of this terrorist group,” state-owned Anadolu news agency quoted Kalin as saying, in comments that emerged after Bolton made his remarks. “Turkey will continue decisively its efforts to end the war, provide security, and implement the process of political transition without discriminating between our Syrian brothers on the basis of religion, ethnicity or sect,” Kalin said. In Washington on Sunday, Trump reiterated that the United States would be pulling its troops out of Syria but suggested the move might not happen soon. “I never said we are doing it that quickly. But we are decimating ISIS,” Trump told reporters. Later on Sunday Bolton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reassured Israel and other allies of the United States’ commitment to their security.

" An offensive by Mexico’s new government against fuel theft at one of the country’s main refineries has led to days of shortages at gas stations in several central states, as authorities move more fuel by tankers and less by vulnerable pipelines. A Reuters witness said many gas stations in the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco state were closed on Sunday, including those operated by state oil firm Pemex, Spain’s Repsol and BP. There were long lines of motorists at those that were operating. “I’ve gone to 10 gas stations and nothing, there’s none at any of them,” said Alan Delgado, trying to fill his Buick truck at a BP gas station in Guadalajara. “This is a serious and critical situation because it complicates work and businesses.” The shortages followed the closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato, and as Pemex started using more tankers to transport fuel. Theft by gangs and oil industry workers from Mexico’s state-controlled refineries is a major drain on government resources, but the measures taken to tackle the crime could also weigh on the economy if shortages drag on. Violent criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way to supplement their income, bleeding money from state coffers and driving bloodshed as they fight rivals and extort oil workers. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, confirmed on Friday that less fuel was being sent through pipelines. “I ask citizens for understanding and support, because we need to solve this problem together. We are trying to get it resolved soon,” Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech. Obrador has vowed to tackle theft “outside and inside” Pemex, or Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], which estimates that fuel worth more than 146 billion pesos ($7.40 billion) has been stolen since 2016 alone. The president said last month that Mexico’s armed forces would take part in security at Pemex installations around the country, including its refinery in Salamanca. Fuel theft there has been linked to a surge in violence, according to Guanajuato state governor Diego Sinhue. The Mexican Association of Gasoline Station business owners warned its members on Jan. 3 that no fuel was being transported via the pipeline from the Salamanca refinery. “You are free to take measures that benefit your customers, to limit the sale (of fuel) to 10 liters per car or whatever you consider necessary to serve the public,” the association said. Guanajuato governor Sinhue took to Twitter on Sunday, saying that Pemex’s chief executive Octavio Romero “confirmed that after reopening the Salamanca-Leon pipeline, he expects to reestablish service to 100 percent of the gasoline stations during the day.” It was not immediately clear whether opening that pipeline would reduce shortages in other regions. Pemex said on Saturday that it is “preferring the use of safer means of transport, which means changes in the logistics for delivery to service stations,” leading to delays in the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato and Queretaro. Pemex said it is aiming to boost distribution in the affected states by up to 20 percent, transporting fuel by tanker trucks and trains. A May 2017 study commissioned by the national energy regulator found that thieves, between 2009 and 2016, had tapped pipelines roughly every 1.4 kms (0.86 miles) along Pemex’s approximately 14,000 km pipeline network. The government has not made clear if they see road and rail transport as a long term solution for fuel distribution. Transporting fuel by road and rail is 12 to 16 times more expensive than by pipeline, said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. “If this keeps happening and expanding to other parts of the country, the Mexican economy is going to have a very tough first quarter,” said Monroy.

" WikiLeaks on Sunday advised journalists not to report 140 different “false and defamatory” statements about its founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June 2012. It was not immediately clear what prompted the advice to media organisations, but WikiLeaks singled out Britain’s Guardian newspaper for publishing what it said was a false report about Assange. The Guardian did not immediately respond late on Sunday to a Reuters request for comment. The Australian set up WikiLeaks as a channel for publishing confidential information from anonymous sources. He is a hero to some for exposing what supporters cast as government abuse of power and for championing free speech, but to others he is a rebel who has undermined the security of the United States. WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family. “There is a pervasive climate of inaccurate claims about WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, including purposeful fabrications planted in large and otherwise ‘reputable’ media outlets,” Wikileaks said an email sent to media organisations and marked “Confidential legal communication. Not for publication.” “Consequently journalists and publishers have a clear responsibility to carefully fact-check from primary sources and to consult the following list to ensure they are not spreading, and have not spread, defamatory falsehoods about WikiLeaks or Julian Assange.” WikiLeaks did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The 5,000-word email included 140 statements that WikiLeaks said were false and defamatory, such as the assertion that Assange had ever been an “agent or officer of any intelligence service”. WikiLeaks also said it was false and defamatory to suggest that Assange, 47, had ever been employed by the Russian government or that he is, or has ever been, close to the Russian state, the Kremlin or Putin. Other items listed as false and defamatory included more personal claims including that Assange bleaches his hair, that he is a hacker, that he has ever neglected an animal or that he has poor personal hygiene. Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff. Later that year, the group released over 90,000 secret documents detailing the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, followed by almost 400,000 internal U.S. military reports detailing operations in Iraq. More than 250,000 classified cables from U.S. embassies followed, then almost 3 million dating back to 1973.",0
" An earthquake hit an area in western Iran near the Iraqi border on Sunday, injuring 75 people, most of them lightly, the head of the country’s emergency medical services said. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initially put the magnitude of the quake at 5.9 but revised this later to 5.5. SPONSORED Pirhossein Koulivand said all but one of the 75 injured had been released after treatment following the earthquake in Gilan Gharb in Kermanshah province, according to the emergency services’ website. In November, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake shook western Iran, injuring more than 700 people, with most suffering minor wounds. Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. In 2003, a 6.6 magnitude quake in southeastern Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the historic city of Bam.",0
" The Palestinian Authority said on Sunday it had ordered its employees to pull out from the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, effectively closing the main exit point from the impoverished Gaza Strip. The dispute over the border stems from a rift between the PA, based in the occupied West Bank and headed by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and the Islamist militant group Hamas, which took control of Gaza more than a decade ago in a civil war. Re-opening the Rafeh crossing, which according to human rights groups is the sole exit point from Gaza for an estimated 95 percent of its 2 million population, will require Egypt to agree on a new operator. It is unclear whether it will allow Hamas to run the passage. Cairo has not so far commented on the situation. PA employees were deployed to Gaza’s border crossings with Israel and Egypt in 2017 under Egyptian mediation in what was seen as the first concrete step towards ending the dispute. The PA said Sunday’s decision to pull out from the crossing was a response to Hamas undermining its operations and detaining some of its workers. “After Hamas’s insistence on bolstering division ... and the questioning, detention and suppression of our employees, we have become convinced it is useless to maintain our presence there,” it said. The decision takes effect on Monday, though the crossing was already scheduled to be closed until Tuesday due to a holiday. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters the closure of the border amounted to “additional sanctions by Abbas against the people of Gaza”. “This is a blow to... Egypt, which had overseen the handover of the crossings as part of the implementation of the reconciliation deal that Abbas has destroyed,” he said. Poverty is rampant in Gaza due to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade and three armed confrontations with Israel since 2008, as well as the internal rivalry. Israel says its restrictions are to stop weapons entering the territory. The two Palestinian groups have tried and failed numerous times to end their dispute. Officials from Abbas’s Fatah movement said Hamas-led security forces have detained nearly 400 of their supporters and activists in Gaza in recent days, while Hamas said dozens of their men were detained by the PA in the West Bank.

" Preliminary results from Democratic Republic of Congo’s tumultuous presidential election will be delayed past Sunday’s deadline, the head of the election commission told Reuters. The commission, known as CENI, had received only 47 percent of vote tally sheets as of Saturday, said its president, Corneille Nangaa, and it was not yet clear when the results would be ready. The delay is the latest setback in a disorganised poll to pick a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled the country of 80 million people since his father was assassinated in 2001. The Dec. 30 vote could mark Congo’s first democratic transition of power since independence from Belgium in 1960. But tensions rose after observers reported a litany of irregularities that the opposition says are part of the ruling party’s effort to steal the election. The opposition, represented by its two main candidates Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, and the ruling coalition all say their candidates have won. “It will not be possible to announce the results tomorrow,” Nangaa said. A CENI spokesman later said that the commission was holding a meeting on Sunday to decide when they will be announced. Worried that disputes and delays could spark the kind of violence seen after the 2006 and 2011 elections, the United Nations Security Council met on Friday to discuss how to react, but was unable to reach an agreement, according to an internal report seen by Reuters. The United States condemned a lack of transparency in the contest, while China, a major investor, lauded the process. “Tensions were mounting while the CENI tabulated the results, notably in light of posturing by parties and candidates,” Leila Zerrougui, head of the UN Stabilization Mission in Democratic Republic of Congo, told the meeting, according to the internal report. But the 15 council members “differed in their appreciation of the problems that beset the process and were divided over the question of whether the Council should issue a press statement”, the report went on to say. A negative international reaction could be problematic for Kabila, whose government has defended the election’s organisation, and could weaken the legitimacy of Kabila’s hand-picked successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, should he be declared winner. In the meeting, France pushed for the publication of a statement that recognised that Congo’s election had allowed people to exercise their democratic right and called for calm, but criticised the government’s decision to cut access to the Internet and some media outlets. The United States, which has threatened to impose sanctions against those who undermine the election process and has deployed troops to Gabon in case its citizens need rescuing from any violence, backed the statement, alongside Britain, Ivory Coast, Belgium and others. South Africa, long a Kabila ally, said the statement could “inflame” the situation if issued before the results, the report said. Russia said it could be seen as an attempt to skew public opinion. China “lauded the manner in which elections were conducted”, the report said, and said a statement should not be published before the results. Congo’s Catholic church body, CENCO, said this week that it had identified the victor based on its own tallies collected by 40,000 observers, though it did not name the winner. The declaration was widely seen as a warning to authorities against rigging the vote.

" U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would pass new legislation to try to reopen parts of the government next week after talks between the Trump administration and Democratic negotiators on Saturday failed to end a two-week partial government shutdown. President Donald Trump is demanding $5.6 billion to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico but Democrats in control of the House of Representatives this week passed a bill to reopen the government without providing additional funding for the wall. Trump says he will not sign the bill until he gets the money for the wall. After a meeting aimed at breaking the deadlock failed on Saturday, Pelosi said House Democrats would seek to reopen government agencies next week through piecemeal appropriation bills, starting with the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service. “This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule,” she said. Vice President Mike Pence led the administration’s team in the meeting with Democratic negotiators on Saturday. He said it was “productive” but an aide said there was no in-depth discussion of a possible compromise level of funding for border security. The two sides agreed to meet again on Sunday. A Democratic aide familiar with the meeting said Democratic staffers urged the administration to reopen the government, arguing that progress on the contentious issue of border security would be difficult while the government was closed. The aide said the administration instead “doubled down on their partisan proposal that led to the Trump shutdown in the first place.” With the two sides sticking to their positions, a quarter of the federal government has been closed for two weeks, leaving 800,000 public workers unpaid. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser, also attended the meeting at the White House, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. They were negotiating with senior staff for the top Democrats in Congress, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer. Pelosi, who took over as House speaker this week following Democratic victories at mid-term elections in November, has said Trump’s proposed wall is “immoral” and a “waste of money.” A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame Democrats. Still, Trump reiterated his demand for a border wall in a series of tweets on Saturday. “The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time,” Trump said. “All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly!” Trump threatened on Friday to take the step of using emergency powers to build the wall without Congress’ approval. Such a move would almost certainly be met with legal challenges. The funding bill passed by Democrats on Jan. 3 included $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras. Trump has in recent days backed away from his earlier insistence that it be a concrete wall on the border, saying a steel fence would work just as well, but he has stuck to his demand of $5.6 billion.",0
" Jose Ramon Fernandez Alvarez, who commanded Cuban forces under the leadership of Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs, repelling an exile invasion supported by the United States, died on Sunday at 95. Fernandez passed away in the early hours of the morning, Cuban state-run media reported, but as is customary in Cuba no information was given on the cause of death. He had reportedly been in poor health the last few years and was hospitalized several months ago. Fernandez joined the Cuban military in the 1940s and received training in the United States. He joined the opposition to the Batista dictatorship in the 1950s but was caught and imprisoned in 1956. He remained behind bars until Castro’s revolution triumphed in 1959. Fernandez was soon put in charge of training the country’s civilian militia due to his military background. He was named commandant in 1961 and brigade general of the reserve in 1966. Fidel Castro and his younger brother Raul considered Fernandez a man they could always rely on and he served throughout the decades in various military, government and Communist Party posts, including adviser to the president, minister of education and president of the Olympic Committee.",0
" An earthquake with a revised magnitude of 6.6 struck 174 km (108 miles) north-northwest of the city of Ternate in Indonesia’s Molucca islands on Sunday, followed by a series of aftershocks, but with no tsunami risk, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake hit at a depth of 60.5 km and was followed by aftershocks of a magnitude of 5.0 to 5.1. Samud Sergi, an official from the search and rescue agency in Ternate, said the quakes had not been felt in the city. A spokesperson for the emergency disaster agency in Tohomon for North Sulawesi said “they had felt nothing in the area and had heard of no damage or casualties”. An earlier report from the USGS gave the magnitude of the quake at 7.0 and the depth at 10 km. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a statement that, based on available data, there was no current tsunami threat from the event.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was in no hurry to find permanent replacements for one-quarter of his Cabinet currently serving in an acting capacity because it gives him “more flexibility.” “I am in no hurry,” Trump told reporters as he departed for Camp David, the U.S. presidential retreat, for meetings on the partial government shutdown. About one-fourth of the U.S. government has been shuttered for more than two weeks and about 800,000 government workers have been either furloughed or working without pay. “I like acting. It gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great Cabinet,” Trump said. He did not elaborate on why they give him more flexibility. There are 24 Cabinet-level positions and six are currently filled by individuals who are serving in an acting capacity after the departure of members confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Other than the White House chief of staff and the vice president, Cabinet-level officials require confirmation by the Senate. Federal law allows presidents to temporarily fill vacancies by appointing acting department heads who are already employees there. Trump said last month he was in no hurry to name a new defence secretary after Jim Mattis quit over policy differences, and he has praised the acting secretary, Patrick Shanahan. David Bernhardt is acting secretary of the Interior Department while Matthew Whitaker is acting attorney general. Andrew Wheeler is acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency while Mick Mulvaney is the acting White House chief of staff. Jonathan Cohen is acting ambassador to the United Nations. In the first two years of Trump’s presidency, there has been a 65 percent turnover rate among senior-level advisers, according to the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.",0
" The Roman Catholic archbishop of Lyon goes on trial on Monday charged with failing to act on historical allegations of sexual abuse of boy scouts by a priest in his diocese. Cardinal Philippe Barbarin is the highest-profile cleric to be caught up in the paedophile scandal inside the Catholic Church in France, and will stand trial alongside five others from his diocese. While most of the recent focus in the Church’s global abuse crisis has been on Australia and Chile, Barbarin’s trial puts the spotlight on Europe’s senior clergy again, just as Pope Francis prepares to host a meeting of senior bishops from around the world in Rome next month to discuss the protection of minors. Barbarin is accused of failing to report allegations of sexual abuse in the 1980s and early 1990s by Father Bernard Preynat - a priest who has admitted sexual abuse, according to his lawyer, and is due to go on trial later this year. The charges carry a potential three-year prison sentence and fines of up to about $50,000. Barbarin told the newspaper Le Monde in August 2017 that he had never concealed allegations against Preynat, but acknowledged shortcomings in his handling of them. “I myself realise that my response at the time was inadequate,” he said. Barbarin’s lawyer, Jean-Felix Luciani, said he expected Barbarin to be acquitted. “He’s accused of covering up for Preynat, whereas in fact it was Barbarin who triggered this whole process,” Luciani said. “You don’t repair one injustice with another.” Barbarin told Le Monde in 2017 that he had previously opened an investigation of Preynat under church or canon law because a judicial investigation was moving so slowly. Barbarin, who moved to the Lyon diocese in 2002, has said he became aware of Preynat’s activities in 2007. He eventually removed the priest from his post in 2015. Barbarin told Le Monde that he had suspended two other priests and called in the judiciary “when I learned of allegations of recent abuses, in 2006 and 2014”. But faced with allegations of abuses said to have taken place 15 or 20 years earlier, he said he “knocked on doors” for advice, but received no satisfactory answer. Lyon prosecutors had previously investigated Barbarin but dropped the probe in the summer of 2016 without a detailed explanation. However, an association of alleged victims called Parole Liberee (“Freed Word”) used a provision of French law to compel the cardinal to stand trial. Pope Francis has come under fire over the Church’s handling of the spreading sexual abuse crisis. In September, researchers said they had found indications of sexual abuse in Germany by 1,670 Catholic clerics over the course of seven decades. On Friday, the Vatican said an Argentine bishop working in a top Vatican financial department was under preliminary investigation for sexual abuse. Pope Francis himself met Barbarin in early 2016, and later told the Catholic newspaper La Croix that it would make no sense for the cardinal to resign before any eventual trial. “According to the information at my disposal, Cardinal Barbarin took the appropriate measures, he took things in hand. He is brave, creative, a missionary,” Francis was quoted as saying.",0
" The main Turkish-backed rebel army has deployed along frontlines close to jihadists in northwest Syria to repel any new militant advance after an offensive that expanded their control over the country’s last rebel-held bastion, rebels and residents said. Islamist Tahrir al Sham, formerly affiliated to al Qaeda, on Sunday entered the town of Atareb, days after capturing from their mainstream rivals the strategic town of Darat Izza, both in the western Aleppo countryside, in a military campaign that has since spread across Idlib and areas near the Turkish border. A convoy of Tahrir al Sham fighters entered the densely populated town after forcing its leaders to hand over control by threatening to storm it if mainstream rebels opposed to their hardline Islamist ideology do not leave. The offensive by Tahrir al Sham has alarmed the National Army, the main Turkish-backed rebel force aimed at unifying disparate factions in the northwest. “We took a decision to repel the aggression by Tahrir al Sham on the Aleppo and Idlib countryside,” their spokesman Major Youssef Hamoud said. “We are reinforcing areas to prevent their expansion and control of more villages and towns.” The National Army compromises about 35,000 fighters from some of the biggest factions in a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced 11 million people from their homes over the last seven years. The jihadists have been the dominant force in rebel-held Idlib province and also have a civil administration that runs basic services in many towns including Idlib city, the provincial capital. Ideological differences divide them from nationalist groups in the Free Syrian Army gathered under the banner of the National Army and the National Liberation Front (NLF), both backed by Turkey. The rebel cause to topple President Bashar al-Assad has been plagued by turf wars and local rivalries. “Tahrir al Sham seek to end the presence of the NLF and control all of Idlib,” Hamoud said. He echoed the view of military experts that the territorial gains would help widen the jihadists’ grip over a strip along the northern border with Turkey to their strongholds further south in the western Aleppo countryside. Hamoud also accused the jihadists of attempting to divert their forces from any Turkish army campaign to seize the city of Manbij and Arab towns located east of the Euphrates River, controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militias. President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to announce a U.S. pull-out from Syria has left open many questions, chiefly whether Kurdish fighters operating in northern Syria would now be targeted by their long-time enemy Turkey.

" Southeast Asian countries should be cautious in negotiating with China on its flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to avoid being trapped in unsustainable debt, 70 percent of respondents said in a policy survey released on Monday. Southeast Asia is increasingly sceptical of U.S. commitment to the region as a strategic partner and a source of security, while China’s reach is seen as growing both politically and economically, the study also showed. “The conventional wisdom that China holds sway in the economic realm while the United States wields its influence in the political-strategic domain will ... need to be revisited in light of the survey results,” it said. The survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, affiliated with the Singapore government, polled 1,008 respondents from all ten nations of the ASEAN grouping, drawn from government, academic and business communities, civil society and the media. Nearly half of the respondents said President Xi Jinping’s hallmark Belt and Road initiative would bring ASEAN “closer into China’s orbit,” while a third said the project lacked transparency and 16 percent predicted it would fail. A large majority, or 70 percent, said their governments “should be cautious in negotiating BRI projects, to avoid getting into unsustainable financial debts with China,” a view strongest in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Some Western governments have accused China of pulling countries into a debt trap with the initiative, an accusation China has denied. China was seen by 73 percent of the respondents as having the greatest economic influence in the region and was also believed to have more influence politically and strategically than the United States. Six out of ten respondents said U.S. influence globally had deteriorated from a year ago and two-thirds believed U.S. engagement with Southeast Asia declined. About a third said they had little or no confidence in the U.S. as a strategic partner and provider of regional security. Fewer than one in 10 saw China as “a benign and benevolent power,” with nearly a half saying Beijing possessed “an intent to turn Southeast Asia into its sphere of influence”. The study’s authors wrote, “This result ... is a wake-up call for China to burnish its negative image across Southeast Asia despite Beijing’s repeated assurance of its benign and peaceful rise.” There was a call for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to play a more active role in Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis, although a majority of the respondents sought mediation rather than diplomatic pressure. The United Nations says 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Myanmar’s Rakhine State to Bangladesh since the military’s crackdown on insurgent attacks. U.N.-mandated investigators have accused Myanmar’s military of carrying out killings, gang rape and arson with “genocidal intent,” an allegation the military has denied.",0
" The spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians worldwide on Sunday presented the head of the Ukrainian church with a decree granting it independence from Moscow, a historic split strongly opposed by Russia. Ukraine sees the break as vital to its security and independence, but it is bound to aggravate the wider conflict between the two countries. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who signed the autocephaly decree on Saturday, handed the document to Ukrainian Metropolitan Epifaniy at St George’s Cathedral in Istanbul after a mass to mark the feast of Epiphany. “Unity has been restored. Now we are united,” Epifaniy told the congregation, standing with Bartholomew at the front of the crowded church, both wearing ceremonial robes and holding staffs. The 39-year-old Epifaniy was chosen to head the new church last month. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who also attended the event, compared the development to Ukraine’s referendum for independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia bitterly opposes the split, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. President Vladimir Putin has warned of possible bloodshed. “We ask you, mother church and all churches to pray for peace in Ukraine,” Epifaniy said, adding Ukrainian people had been suffering for five years from a war “brought from outside”. Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine imposed martial law in November, citing the threat of a full-scale invasion after Russia captured three of its vessels in the Kerch Strait. The patriarchate, the seat of the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, endorsed Ukraine’s request for the new church in October. “God has heard our prayers,” Poroshenko said in an address on Ukrainian television after the handover of the decree, or tomos. “Tomos for Ukraine is actually another act of declaring the country’s independence.” The pro-Western Poroshenko lobbied hard for the church’s creation. He faces a tight election race in March and it may give him a boost. He will take part in a service in Kiev on Monday at the St Sophia Cathedral, now a museum only used for major religious events. The decree will be displayed at the cathedral for the public to view from Monday, the church said. The Ukrainian Orthodox church has been beholden to Moscow for hundreds of years, and Ukraine’s leaders see church independence as vital to tackling Russian meddling. Kiev says Moscow-backed churches on its soil are a Kremlin tool to spread propaganda and support separatists in the eastern Donbass region in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people. The churches strongly deny this. Religious divisions deepened in Ukraine after 2014 and two Orthodox factions vie for dominance. The church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, sees itself as the only legitimate church in Ukraine. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian MPs passed a law that could force the church to add “Russian” to its name. The rival Kiev Patriarchate was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its popularity has grown since 2014. It favours European integration and championed the independent church but the Moscow Patriarchate denounces it as schismatic.

" Israel has arrested five Jewish seminary students in the occupied West Bank in connection with a rock attack on a Palestinian car that killed a woman, the Israeli domestic intelligence service said on Sunday. The detainees “are suspected of grave terrorist offenses including murder”, the Shin Bet service said in a statement after a court order limiting media coverage of the Dec. 30 arrests was lifted. Aisha al-Rawbi, 47, suffered a fatal head wound from a rock thrown at her car near the Palestinian city of Nablus on Oct. 12. The Shin Bet said the five detainees, who it did not name, attend a seminary in Rehelim, a neighbouring Jewish settlement. They are all under the age of 18 and have not been formally charged.

" Hundreds of Greek Cypriots marked the religious holiday of Epiphany on Sunday in a rare vigil to the fringes of an abandoned town wrecked by a war which split the island 45 years ago. Against the backdrop of crumbling hotels and homes ringed with barbed wire, a Greek Orthodox priest cast a cross into the sea off the coast of Famagusta, symbolizing a blessing of the waters, and the manifestation of Jesus as the son of God. Earlier, a liturgy was held within the walled medieval city of Famagusta. Varosha, a southern suburb of Famagusta, has been fenced off and abandoned since Turkey invaded northern Cyprus after a Greek-inspired coup in 1974. Religious ceremonies in the north require permission from Turkish Cypriot authorities. Ringed by a fence which extends into the sea, the former holiday resort has been off limits to anyone but the Turkish military since its 39,000 Greek Cypriot residents fled advancing Turkish troops. “This is part of our being and we want to reunify the island,” said Greek Cypriot Anna Marangou, who is from Varosha. “We want peace, we want to bring up our kids and grandkids in ways where people are safe...It’s a wish for a new year, its a wish we get our act together to do it,” she said. Cyprus peace talks collapsed in mid-2017. The island’s Greek Cypriots live predominantly in the south, and Turkish Cypriots in the north since the 1974 war.

" Chancellor Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), demanded on Sunday that her interior minister quickly find out what Germany’s security agencies knew about a huge data breach and how they reacted. The breach has shocked Germany’s establishment and risks rocking Merkel’s awkward ‘grand coalition’ again just months after a row over the fate of the domestic intelligence agency chief came close to tearing apart the ruling alliance. The government said on Friday that personal data and documents from hundreds of German politicians and public figures including Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the centre-left (SPD), told the Funke media group the government must quickly shed light on “which agencies knew what exactly when, and how that was dealt with”. “This should be a priority for (Interior Minister) Horst Seehofer. It’s about protecting our democracy,” Klingbeil added. Seehofer told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung he only became aware of the breach on Friday morning, but that he would share everything he finds out with the public and intended to do so by the middle of this week at the latest. The ecologist Greens leader in parliament, Anton Hofreiter, said the president of the BSI cyber defence agency, Arne Schoenbohm, must explain himself urgently in an extraordinary parliamentary committee meeting. The BSI on Saturday defended its role in responding to the data breach, saying it could not have connected individual cases it was aware of last year until the entire data release became public last week. Last year, Seehofer was at the centre of a political storm over another security agency chief, whose the fate almost tore apart Merkel’s coalition of her conservative bloc and the SPD. Despite SPD resistance, Seehofer rescued Hans-Georg Maassen from dismissal in September when the domestic spy chief questioned the authenticity of videos showing far-right nationalists chasing immigrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz. But Maassen was subsequently sacked in November over a speech given behind closed doors condemning “naive and leftist” government policies.

" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday sought to ease market concerns that the U.S. central bank was ignoring signs of an economic slowdown, saying he was aware of the risks and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. Speaking after months of volatility in world bond and stock markets, Powell avoided some of the communication missteps that in the past have roiled rather than calmed investors. He also pledged to stay in his job even if asked to quit by President Donald Trump, who has been critical of him. Echoing a more sympathetic tone recently espoused by some of his colleagues, Powell said the Fed was “listening” to markets and would balance the steady flow of strong economic data against the array of risks - from slowing global growth to worries about the U.S.-China trade war - that have spooked investors. The message was heard on Wall Street, where major stock indexes surged about 3.5 percent to a more than two-week high. The market bounce came after a volatile December selloff in which traders grew increasingly sceptical of the Fed’s upbeat forecasts and plans to keep hiking interest rates in 2019. “Particularly with the muted inflation readings that we’ve seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,” Powell told the American Economic Association in Atlanta. The Fed, which hiked benchmark U.S. interest rates four times last year including in December, is however not on a preset path and could pause policy tightening as it did in 2016 when global growth concerns led to doubts about the U.S. economic recovery, he said. “We are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly” if needed, Powell said, speaking on a panel alongside former Fed chiefs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. That flexibility, he added, applied as well to the monthly reductions to the Fed’s balance sheet. The Fed chief stressed that the economy remained on track and that the job market was quite strong. He did not address Fed forecasts from December that sketched out two more rate rises this year, but, combined with the messages of Fed presidents who in recent days downplayed that tightening plan, he delivered the sort of temperate message investors had hoped to hear. “We really need to be looking at the data and having the economy tell us, do we need to move more? Do we need to move more, faster? Can we wait?,” Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview with Reuters. “We should take our time and assess ... We may be where we need to be.” Her comments, from a sometimes hawkish Fed official, highlighted the change in tone at a central bank that, after two years of roughly quarterly rate increases, was now assessing the risks of going too far. Following Powell’s remarks, Treasury yields rose and futures traders began pricing in a small chance of a rate hike this year, versus no chance seen before Powell began speaking. Compared to comments he made after the Fed raised rates last month, “it’s not that he’s changed his message ... but that he explained it more patiently and in greater detail,” said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. Powell’s appearance in Atlanta was his first since last month’s rate increase and a public lashing from Trump, who according to sources asked aides about his power to fire the Fed chairman. The head of the Fed, once confirmed by the Senate, can only be removed “for cause”, not a policy disagreement. Powell responded with a terse “No” when asked if he would resign if Trump requested him to do so. The recent market turbulence has posed a dilemma for the Fed, as a seeming loss of confidence in financial markets about the U.S. economy’s prospects was offset by upbeat data from the real economy, including a strong December jobs report. The Labor Department reported on Friday that 312,000 jobs were created last month, well above market expectations. Wages and labour force participation both rose, signalling sustained economic strength. Powell called the jobs report “very strong,” with U.S. data “on track to sustain good momentum into the new year.” The world’s biggest economy expanded well above potential last year and, along with U.S. consumers, is expected to remain strong through this year. Yet signs are growing that Trump’s tit-for-tat trade war with China is taking a toll: this week, tech giant Apple and grains trader Cargill warned about weaker sales in China. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Thursday that planned rate hikes should be halted for now, while on Friday Mester said she sees only one or two rate hikes this year. A third Fed president, Thomas Barkin of Richmond, said he is hearing more concerns about economic risks and trade. “The markets are feeling better that the Fed is not strangling the overall economy and perhaps forcing it into a recession, and that removes a monetary policy concern that has been hanging over the market for the past few months,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC. The Fed’s tightening cycle includes both rate hikes and the gradual shedding of its more than $4 trillion (3 trillion pounds) in assets. Powell said he did not think the latter was having much impact on markets, but that the strategy would be changed if it started interfering with the bank’s broader goals of maintaining strong employment and stable inflation. While not a change in policy, it was a nod to market concerns that the Fed had a key decision on “auto-pilot,” as Powell put it last month, even as it pledged to be dependent on economic data. “The markets are pricing in downside risks ... and they are obviously well ahead of the data, particularly if you look at this morning’s labour market data,” Powell said. “I’ll just say that we are listening carefully to that ..., listening sensitively to the message that markets are sending, and we are going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward.”",0
" From rising wages to a slowdown in housing, economic evidence is mounting that the U.S. Federal Reserve is at or near a neutral level of interest rates where it can take stock of where the economy stands before deciding on its next moves, Cleveland Federal Reserve president Loretta Mester said on Friday. The comments from a usually hawkish reserve bank president, made in an interview on the sidelines of the American Economic Association annual meeting, add to the sense that the roughly quarterly pace of rate hikes enacted by the Fed for the past two years may take a pause this year absent a surprise jump in inflation or faster-than-expected economic growth. “We are in a new world,” Mester said, where the obvious need to raise rates has given way to a situation where economic growth is expected to slow, wages are rising on the basis of low unemployment, interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy like housing have ebbed, and the unemployment rate has roughly “stabilized” at a low level. Taken together, Mester said, those are the sorts of developments one would expect in an economy where interest rates were near a neutral level that was neither encouraging nor holding back economic activity. “We really need to be looking at the data and having the economy tell us, do we need to move more? Do we need to move more, faster? Can we wait?” Mester said. “We should take our time and assess....We may be where we need to be.” Overall, she said she felt the Fed was in a “really good spot.” Mester, reiterating comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier in the day, said she was also paying careful attention to recent volatility in financial markets, both for the information that may convey about economic risks, and for the risks volatility itself could produce if it starts to undermine economic confidence. “Obviously that is something you want to pay attention to,” Mester said. But she said the turbulence may also stem from a different view of the economy than that shared by many Fed officials who feel confident U.S. growth will remain on track for the next year, with labour markets still strong. “What does what is going on in the financial markets tell you about the fundamentals? That is an open question,” Mester said. “My interpretation is that the markets did see and put emphasis on the downside risks to growth and some of the softening data coming out of China and some of the European countries. On the other hand the economic fundamentals and today’s labour market report supports a view that the U.S. economy is still on sound footing.” Stocks surged on Friday after the Labor Department reported U.S. firms created 312,000 jobs in December, and Powell said the Fed would be flexible in deciding on any further rate increases.",0
" At least 30 Afghans were killed on Sunday when the tunnel they were digging in to mine gold in northern Afghanistan collapsed, officials said. Officials said the victims were villagers who were mining for gold illegally, rather than in a government project. “Poor villagers during winters try to compensate their earnings by pursuing illegal mining. They dig tunnels to enter the mines,” Nek Mohammad Nazari, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said. He said the tunnel had caved in. A police spokesman for Badakhshan province, Sanaullah Rohani, earlier said the cause of the accident, which occurred in heavy snowfall, was a landslide. Rohani said seven people were injured alongside the at least 30 killed, while they were working inside the mine in Kohistan district. Rohani said about 50 illegal miners were present in the mine when the incident occurred and two rescue teams were deployed to help the injured. Landslides are frequent in the northern mountainous provinces of Afghanistan. Last year the Afghan government signed two contracts for the exploration of copper and gold deposits in northern provinces, to try to prevent illegal mining and move away from its dependence on foreign aid by tapping its natural resources.",0
" Poland will close ‘escape rooms’ that do not meet safety standards, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Sunday after a fire killed five teenage girls. The girls were celebrating a birthday at an escape room in the northern town of Koszalin when the fire broke out. The venue’s owner was arrested on Sunday, Polish media reported. Authorities carried out inspections of at least 178 escape room locations across Poland at the weekend and found 129 did not meet health and safety standards, said the head of state fire services Leszek Suski. Thirteen locations were ordered closed. In escape rooms, participants are locked in and race against the clock to solve puzzles and challenges to open a way out. “This was unprecedented ... any sort of prevention is important,” Morawiecki told reporters. Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski urged parents to report potential safety violations at escape rooms or other children’s entertainment centres. “Sanctions need to be harsh,” Brudzinski said. Morawiecki said he had ordered a report on the around 1,100 escape rooms or similar locations across Poland and the government would determine if changes to safety regulations were needed.",0
" Dozens of Thai activists on Sunday protested against a possible delay of a national election set for next month, the first such gathering since the military government lifted a ban on political activity imposed after a 2014 coup. The junta has promised and postponed the election several times since it came to power, with the latest date set for Feb. 24. However, the vote faces yet another postponement after Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam suggested on Friday that post-election events might clash with rituals related to King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s coronation from May 4-6. That prompted the first protest since the junta lifted a ban on political activities and a gathering of more than five people in December. “We want the government to hold an election as soon as possible, so that democracy can move forward in our country,” said Anon Nampa, a human rights lawyer and anti-junta activist who organised the protest at the Victory Monument area in central Bangkok. Protestors carried signs which read “We Want Election” and “Election only on Feb 24, 2019”, chanting “No delay!” in unison. Thailand’s Election Commission has not officially announced the postponement but said it has acknowledged the government’s suggestion that the vote be pushed back. The military government also failed to issue an official decree committing to holding a general election by Friday, meaning it is less likely to be held on Feb. 24 under the current timeline laid out. The election is meant to restore democracy after a 2014 military coup ousted an elected prime minister, though changes to the constitution in the interim ensure the military will retain a great deal of control.",0
" Chinese gay dating app Blued is halting new user registration for a week, it said on Sunday, following media reports that underage users caught HIV after going on dates set up via the world’s largest networking app for the LGBT community. China has a vibrant lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender scene (LGBT) scene, though activists say conservative attitudes among some groups in society have prompted occasional government clampdowns. On Saturday, citing academic research, financial magazine Caixin said juveniles were heavily involved in the gay dating app, where some teenagers had even hosted livestreaming. It added that many gay teenagers had unprotected sex through the app and contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In response, Blued vowed to launch a “comprehensive content audit and regulation,” and crack down on juvenile users posing as adults and on texts, pictures and groups that involve minors. “Blued always forbids juveniles from logging on and using the app,” it said in a statement on its verified account on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. The company added that it had enabled artificial intelligence to weed out pornographic content since last year, and vowed to further support AIDS prevention work. The Beijing-based company did not immediately reply to a request from Reuters for comment on Sunday. Blued, which was launched in 2010 and now boasts 40 million registered users, is backed by state-run media Beijing News. It is the brainchild of a former policeman who quit his job to play Cupid to millions of gay men in China. Grindr, a Los Angeles-based gay dating app well-known globally, is also owned by a Chinese company.",0
" Apple Inc’s chief executive Tim Cook has his work cut out in China this year: the iPhone maker faces the looming threat of a court-ordered sales ban, the uncertain outcome of trade war talks and the roll-out of a new 5G network, where it finds itself behind rivals like Huawei and Samsung. The complex outlook raises a challenge for Apple as it looks to revive its China fortunes after weakness there sparked a rare drop in its global sales forecast, knocked $75 billion from its market valuation and roiled global markets. Cook told investors that the main drag on the firm’s performance in China had been a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the country’s economy, exacerbated by the impact of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. “We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,” he said. Chinese shoppers told Reuters another element had been key: the high price-tag on Apple’s flagship phones. Analysts said the firm faced a brewing storm of challenges: an economic slowdown, stronger rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] bringing out comparable tech at lower prices and bubbling patriotic sentiment amid the trade war. A Chinese court has also issued a preliminary injunction banning some Apple phones, part of a legal battle with chip maker Qualcomm Inc. This ban, potentially hitting iPhone models from the 6S through the X, has yet to be enforced. On Thursday a local industry body, the China Anti-Infringement and Anti-Counterfeit Innovation Strategic Alliance, called on Apple to heed the court order and not “trample the Chinese law by leveraging its super economic power and clout.” Apple declined to comment on the group’s statement but has previously said it believes its current phones comply with the Chinese court’s order. “These are tough times for Apple in China,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint, adding the iPhone could see its market share slip to 7 percent this year in the face of stronger local rivals and worry about the sales ban. Apple’s market share in the third-quarter of 2018 was around 9 percent, and has dipped from above 14 percent in 2015, overtaken by local rivals like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Apple vs Huawei: tmsnrt.rs/2GWXNEf Another question mark for Apple is its 5G strategy in China, where the U.S. firm is not expected to have a 5G-enabled phone until 2020, behind rivals like Huawei, Xiaomi Corp and Samsung Electronics. China is looking to push ahead with its rollout of a faster 5G network, with a pre-commercial phase this year and a commercial network in 2020. Some are looking to make an early bet on the technology. Huawei is planning a 5G phone mid-year, while Xiaomi is aiming for the third quarter. Samsung is expected to unveil a 5G phone in the first half of the year. Industry insiders, however, said Apple would likely hold off until the fall of 2020 to have its own 5G-enabled phone, a strategy that would bypass the untested early period of the technology, but which could mean Chinese shoppers delay iPhone purchases or buy another brand that switched to 5G earlier. “I’ll definitely be paying attention to 5G functionality when I buy my next phone,” said Wu Chengjun, a graduate student in Beijing who currently uses an iPhone X. With the exception of Huawei, which makes it own 5G chips, Qualcomm is providing the technology to many of the major phone makers releasing 5G handsets this year. “If you’re a [phone maker] looking for a ‘super cycle’ [of sales], if you don’t have 5G, your situation won’t get any better,” Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president, told Reuters in an interview. “The carrier channel is going to be incentivized to start selling 5G phones in the second half” of 2019, he said. But there are risks integrating 5G too early into high-end smart phones because the technology requires deeply re-designing the devices with multiple new antennas. Given spotty coverage in 2019, gambling on a new design before networks are mature could be more risk than reward, said Darryn Lowe, a Bain & Co partner who works with the wireless industry. “When you think about 5G, it’s a heck of a lot more complicated than an aluminum strip running around the phone,” he said. And other shoppers and analysts said Apple’s more cautious approach to 5G made sense and that the firm would not likely lose out too much to rivals by delaying its launch. Apple’s decision to wait to adopt 4G until after other makers didn’t hurt it. But that was when consumers commonly purchased a phone every two years, a cycle that has elongated and might prompt buyers to want a more “future proof” device, said Glenn Lurie, CEO of Synchronoss Technologies and the former head of AT&T’s wireless unit. “If you’re going to walk in to make a 30-month decision, the concept that I’ve already got 5G built in, it feels pretty good,” Lurie said. But buyers such as Li Hongzhuo, 22, a student in Beijing, said he was interested in 5G, but it wouldn’t be the deciding factor and he preferred to wait until the technology was tried and tested. “Typically my needs for my phone are high speeds for downloading videos or transferring files from chat apps. This will get faster (with 5G), but 4G already satisfies my needs,” said Li. “I won’t really consider switching my phone until 5G has been operating stably on the market for some time without any bugs – or unless they stop offering 4G.”",0
" An Egyptian police officer was killed on Saturday while attempting to defuse a bomb found near a church in an eastern Cairo suburb, state television reported, less than two days before Egypt’s Christians celebrate the Coptic Christmas. The device was one of two found inside a bag on a nearby rooftop, three security sources and state media reported. Two policemen and an onlooker were also injured when the device exploded, the security sources said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Egyptian security forces have for years battled Islamist insurgents who have attacked Coptic Christians, tourists and security personnel. Security forces have stepped up their presence outside churches and other places of worship ahead of New Year’s Eve and Coptic Christmas, which is celebrated on Jan. 7. The Copts, who make up around 10 percent of the population, have long complained of discrimination. Authorities have placed armed guards outside churches and monasteries in an attempt to protect them from jihadist attacks. In November, militants killed seven people returning from baptising a child at a Coptic monastery about 260 km (160 miles) up the River Nile from Cairo.",0
" Senator Elizabeth Warren informally kicked off the 2020 Democratic presidential nominating fight on a weekend visit to Iowa, condemning the corrupting influence of money on politics and lamenting lost economic opportunities for working families. In the state that holds the first presidential nominating contest in 13 months, Warren introduced herself to Iowa crowds with tales of her working-class upbringing in Oklahoma and emphasized her signature theme of income inequality. “Washington works great for those with money but not for anyone else. We need to call this what it is, corruption pure and simple,” the Massachusetts senator told Democrats in Sioux City on the second of five public stops during her three-day visit. It was an early jump on the race for Warren, who formed a presidential exploratory committee and began hiring staff this week. So far she is the biggest name to enter what promises to be a crowded Democratic field, with at least two dozen others considering a run. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro also has formed an exploratory committee, and former U.S. Representative John Delaney became the first Democrat to formally declare last year and has campaigned extensively in the state. But Warren, 69, had Iowa to herself this weekend, and she used the time to make contacts with prominent state activists and court crowds with promises to fight what she called a rigged economic system that favours the wealthy. “These are dangerous times for our country, and Iowa is going to play a big part in determining where we go next,” said Warren. She has been one of the most outspoken critics of President Donald Trump, a Republican, but rarely mentioned him by name at her public events on Friday and Saturday. In the Senate, Warren is also an outspoken critic of Wall Street and is a leader of the party’s progressive wing, but she could face competition in the nomination fight from other liberal voices such as fellow Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. Democrats face lingering tensions between their most liberal voices such as Warren and the more pragmatic wing, which includes former Vice President Joe Biden and several former governors and mayors who are considering running. In Iowa, Warren said her childhood in Oklahoma shaped her populist economic views. She was the daughter of a janitor who lost work after a heart attack, forcing her mother to take a minimum wage job. “That minimum wage job saved our house and it saved our family,” Warren said. “Today, a minimum wage job in America will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty. That’s why I’m in this fight.” Local Democrats said they were anxious to start focusing on picking a challenger for Trump, although most said it was way too early for them to commit to a candidate. “This is just the beginning, I’m excited to see it start,” said Lisa Koch, 48, an attorney from Council Bluffs who said she was a long-time fan of Warren’s but worried her gender, age or combative approach might turn off some voters. Linda Drury, 62, of Holstein, Iowa, said she was impressed with Warren. She was afraid Warren might come off as angry, but “that’s not anger, that’s passion.” A December Des Moines Register/CNN poll of likely 2020 Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa found Warren in fourth place with 8 percent support, trailing three candidates who have not yet entered the race - Biden at 32 percent, Sanders at 19 percent and former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas at 11 percent. That poll found 65 percent of likely caucus-goers viewed Warren favourably, and 20 percent saw her unfavourably. Angela Nelson, 50, a special education teacher from Omaha, Nebraska, said she was concerned to see questions raised about Warren’s likeability amid comparisons to Hillary Clinton, the unsuccessful 2016 Democratic nominee. “It bothers me that there is this test of likability just because she is a woman,” Nelson said. “It’s time for our country to move beyond that.” In Sioux City, Warren was asked by a member of the crowd about her controversial decision to take a DNA test to ease questions about her claims to Native American ancestry. Trump frequently belittles Warren’s claims by calling her “Pocahantas,” but she faced criticism from fellow Democrats and Native Americans for taking the test. “I am not a person of colour. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference,” Warren said. “My decision was to put it all out there.”",0
" German police have detained three men suspected of involvement in an explosion that targeted an office of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party in the eastern state of Saxony. No one was injured in the explosion outside the AfD office in the city of Doebeln late on Thursday. The blast set the office on fire and damaged vehicles and nearby buildings, Saxony’s LKA criminal investigation office said in a statement. The LKA said its anti-terrorism unit had determined that the explosion was an escalation in politically motivated attacks targeting AfD offices in Saxony that are usually limited to acts of vandalism. “The attack against the AfD office in Doebeln is special given that the explosion was intended to harm people,” the LKA said. Saxony was the site of far-right riots and demonstrations sparked by the stabbing to death of a Cuban-German man in the city of Chemnitz in August, initially blamed on two migrants from Iraq and Syria. The riots, which featured skinheads performing the Hitler salute and chasing migrants in the streets of Chemnitz, highlighted the depth of a rift created by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to welcome almost one million asylum seekers, mainly Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Saxony has a large far-right scene. But it is also home to many supporters of the hard-left Die Linke, which is the second-largest party in the regional assembly. Police said the three men it detained were aged 29, 32 and 50. The LKA’s anti-terrorism unit is still investigating the incident.",0
" Britain will hold a trial run on Monday of its plans for dealing with long queues of lorries at the southeastern port of Dover caused by disruption to cross-Channel traffic in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The test will involve 150 trucks driving between a disused local airport, which will be used as a lorry park, and Dover to see if they clog up the road network. With less than three months until Britain leaves the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May is yet to win parliament’s backing for her Brexit deal and the government has stepped up preparations for the risk of leaving without a deal. Dover is Britain’s main gateway to Europe, with up to 16,000 trucks a day passing through to the French port Calais at peak times, transporting everything from perishable food to medicines and industrial goods needed to keep factories running. If it becomes blocked up by customs checks, tailbacks of lorries would quickly form on roads leading to Dover. Under the government’s plans, known as Operation Brock, Manston airport some 20 miles (32 km)to the north and parts of two motorways could become lorry parks. “We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU. However, it is the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal,” a spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said. “We will be testing part of Operation Brock to ensure that, if it needs to be implemented, the system is fully functional.”",0
" Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on Saturday for international support to defend the self-ruled island’s democracy and way of life in the face of renewed threats from China. Tsai’s comments came days after Chinese President Xi Jinping said nobody could change the fact that Taiwan was part of China, and that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should seek “reunification”. “We hope that the international community takes it seriously and can voice support and help us,” Tsai told reporters in Taipei, referring to threats by China to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. If the international community did not support a democratic country that was under threat, “we might have to ask which country might be next?” Tsai added. Taiwan is China’s most sensitive issue and is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory. Xi has stepped up pressure on the democratic island since Tsai from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party became president in 2016. President Xi said on Wednesday that China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful “reunification” with the island. In response, Tsai has said the island would not accept a “one country, two systems” political arrangement with China, while stressing all cross-Strait negotiations needed to be carried out on a government-to-government basis. Tsai on Saturday also urged China to have a “correct understanding” of what Taiwanese think and said actions such as political bullying were unhelpful in cross-strait relations.",0
" Three men were killed and four wounded in a shooting at a bowling alley in the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance and police said early on Saturday they were searching for a suspect or suspects. The incident followed a fight at the Gable House Bowl, a bowling alley and arcade that also offers laser tag, according to local media. The Torrance Police Department said officers responded to a shot-fired call at the location found multiple gunshot victims. Two men were taken to hospital, two opted to seek their own medical attention, and three were pronounced dead at the scene. “Investigators are currently conducting a follow-up investigation, and are working to identify the suspect(s) involved,” the department said in a statement. Customers described a fight before the gunshots rang out. “We just ran into the bar and we just took cover because after the fight we heard ‘pop! pop!’” Gable House Bowl patron Jesus Perez told the Los Angeles Times. Torrance is about 25 miles (40 km) south of Los Angeles.",0
" The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday the United States had detained a Russian citizen, a day after Moscow arrested the former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan on suspicion of spying. Whelan was taken into custody by Russia’s Federal Security Service on Dec. 28. His family have said he is innocent and that he was in Moscow to attend a wedding. The ministry said the United States detained Russian citizen Dmitry Makarenko on Dec. 29 on the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean, and had transferred him to Florida. “... Makarenko, born in 1979, has arrived on Saipan Island with his wife, underage children and elderly parents. He was detained by FBI personnel at the airport right after his arrival,” the ministry said. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow could not immediately be reached for comment. A State Department spokesman in Washington referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond. Papers filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida show Makarenko was accused in June 2017 by federal prosecutors of conspiring with another man, Vladimir Nevidomy, to export defence articles including night-vision scopes from the United States to Russia without U.S. approval. Makarenko, who was listed as a resident of Vladivostok, was declared a fugitive from U.S. justice in Jan. 2018. Nevidomy, a resident of Hallandale Beach, Florida, pleaded guilty in June 2018 and was sentenced to 26 months in prison, the court papers showed. The accusations from both sides could further complicate a strained relationship between Moscow and Washington, despite the professed desire of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to build a personal rapport. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that Washington had asked Moscow to explain Whelan’s arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determined his detention is inappropriate. Britain cautioned Russia on Friday that individuals should not be used as diplomatic pawns. Whelan also holds a British passport. The Russian ministry said in its statement that Moscow diplomats had not been able to reach Makarenko in Florida and said Washington had yet to explain his detention. Before Moscow gave details of Makarenko’s detention, experts had speculated that Moscow could exchange Whelan for Russian nationals held by Washington. Commenting on that possibility, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday: “I see no reasons to raise this issue in context of exchanges. We should undergo all the procedures needed in this situation,” Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. Whelan’s Toronto-based twin brother David Whelan told Reuters on Saturday that U.S. embassy officials met with his sibling on Wednesday and would visit him again next week. “He seemed as well as can be expected in a Russian jail. He was missing a lot of personal necessities, like toilet paper, that aren’t provided,” David Whelan said in a telephone interview. “So the State Department has helped us set up an account ... so that he can buy the supplies that he needs.”",0
" Germany’s BSI cyber defence agency on Saturday defended its role in responding to a far-reaching data breach, saying it could not have connected individual cases it was aware of last year until the entire data release became public. The government said on Friday that personal data and documents from hundreds of German politicians and public figures including Chancellor Angela Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. The incident has shocked the establishment and prompted calls for security agencies to clarify whether any security deficiencies they were aware of had been exploited, and if they could have acted sooner to head off the breach. The BSI said in a statement that it was contacted by a lawmaker in early December about suspicious activity on their private email and social media accounts. “Only by becoming aware of the release of the data sets via the Twitter account ‘G0d’ on Jan. 3, 2019, could the BSI in a further analysis on Jan. 4, 2019 connect this case and four other cases that the BSI became aware of during 2018,” it said. “At the beginning of December 2018, it was not foreseeable that there would be more cases.” The BSI said on Friday all but one of the seven parties in the lower house had been affected. German media said that party was the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). Last year, lawmakers said a powerful cyber attack had breached the foreign ministry’s computer network. Security officials have blamed most previous breaches of data security on a Russian hacking group, while the Kremlin has consistently denied involvement in such incidents. After the latest data breach, Justice Minister Katarina Barley said she was considering stricter security requirements for software makers and Internet platform operators. “We are examining the extent to which stricter legal provisions are useful and necessary here,” she told weekly newspaper Welt am Sonntag, according to a pre-released article. Authorities were investigating all possibilities, including espionage, one government source said on Friday, adding that it was unlikely any single person could have compiled the massive amounts of data that had been released. The BSI said investigations so far had showed the data breaches predominantly concerned private and personal accounts, but that it is responsible for the operational protection of government networks.

" Comments from Brazil’s new right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro that he would be open to the United States operating a military base on Brazilian soil have not been well received by the country’s armed forces, a senior army officer told Reuters on Saturday. Bolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, said in a television interview on Thursday he might be willing to allow a U.S. base in Brazil as a way to counter Russian influence in Venezuela, a move that would mark a sharp shift in direction for Brazilian foreign policy. Brazil’s military would be against a U.S. base in the country, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he has not been authorized to discuss the matter publicly. He added that the possibility of ceding territory for a base took officers by surprise in the Brazilian military, which has traditionally been a zealous guardian of national sovereignty. The Ministry of Defense said on Saturday it has not been informed of such a proposal by Bolsonaro, a former Army officer turned politician who has appointed retired generals to his cabinet. “The president has not discussed this with the defence minister,” said Major Sylvia Martins, a spokeswoman for the ministry. Bolsonaro, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, has quickly moved to align Brazil more closely with the Trump administration, which was represented by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at his swearing in on Tuesday. Pompeo told reporters on Wednesday that the United States and Brazil had “an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes” in the region, naming Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo confirmed Bolsonaro’s willingness to allow a U.S. base in comments to reporters in Lima on Friday during a meeting of the Lima Group of 13 countries monitoring Venezuela’s political and economic crisis. Araújo said Bolsonaro would discuss the base offer with Trump during an expected visit to Washington in March, the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported. The Lima Group of Latin American nations plus Canada said on Friday that last year’s elections in Venezuela were not democratic and they would not recognise the legitimacy of leftist President Nicolas Maduro’s new term starting Jan. 10. Bolsonaro said in the television interview that he is worried about Russia’s closeness with Maduro, the most significant U.S. foe in Latin America. A visit to Venezuela by two Russian nuclear-capable strategic bombers in December angered the U.S. government..",0
" Thousands marched through Budapest’s city centre on Saturday to protest against a new law that allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtime. Opposition groups have staged several rallies in the past weeks in the Hungarian capital and other cities against what they said was an authoritarian rule of conservative nationalist Viktor Orban. Saturday’s rally, organised by opposition parties, trade unions and civic groups, mainly targeted the new labour law dubbed by critics as “slave law”. The protesters marched in snowfall from the historic Heroes Square to the parliament building on the bank of the Danube river, carrying banners such as “Sweep away the regime”. “We disagree with almost everything that is going on since this government got into power (in 2010), from corruption to pseudo-democracy,” said 50-year old housewife Eva Demeter. She said more Hungarians were pouring onto the streets because the slave law “affects a bigger crowd”. Some of the protesters posted on social media or carried banners calling for a “national strike”. The modification to the labour code passed by parliament last month has faced intense criticism and sparked the biggest street protest in over a year. Potentially, it could add two extra hours to an average work day, or the equivalent of an extra workday per week. Zoltan Mucsi, the head of steelmaker Dunaferr’s Vasas trade union, said it was undemocratic that the government did not discuss the labour code changes with the unions. Some of the main trade union groups may resort to a strike if the government does not sit down with them to negotiate, he told Reuters. Trade union membership in Hungary is estimated at below a tenth of the workforce, about half the level in Germany, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The past weeks’ anti-government rallies were also against a law that sets up new courts which critics say could be politically manipulated, and against bias in state-controlled media. The earlier protests have been mostly peaceful, though there were some clashes with police who used tear gas. The ruling Fidesz party reiterated in a statement on Thursday that the protests were part of a campaign for the European Parliament elections in May to help those who support mass migration into the European Union. Fidesz won Hungarian elections with a landslide last year, with the ticket of resisting mass immigration into the EU.",0
" Gaza authorities arrested five Palestinians on Saturday on suspicion of ransacking the offices of President Mahmoud Abbas’s official Palestine Television station, Hamas’s interior ministry said. On Friday, assailants destroyed cameras, editing and broadcasting equipment in the Gaza office of the station, part of the Palestinian Broadcast Corporation (PBC), which broadcasts material supportive of Abbas. Station officials immediately blamed Hamas for the attack. The incident underscored tensions between Abbas’s Western-backed Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank, and Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza. But Hamas on Saturday said all five suspects men were former employees of the Palestinian Authority, whose salaries were recently suspended. There was no immediate response from the Palestinian Authority. There has long been antipathy between Hamas, which won the last Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and is opposed to any peace negotiations with Israel, and with Abbas’s more moderate and secular Fatah faction. The two rivals have tried and failed to end the divisions. Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation pact that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas, but a dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation.

" Five teenage girls killed by a fire in an “escape room” attraction in Poland might have survived if there had been a proper evacuation route, a senior firefighter said on Saturday. In “escape rooms”, participants are locked in a room and race against the clock to solve puzzles and challenges to open a way out. The girls killed in Koszalin, in northern Poland, on Friday were taking part in a birthday treat. One other person was being treated for burns. “The tragedy occurred primarily due to the lack of an effective evacuation route,” said Leszek Suski, head of the state firefighting service, according to the PAP news agency. A local prosecutor told reporters the fire had probably been caused by an escape of gas near the heating system boiler. PAP said scores of escape rooms across Poland would now be inspected for safety. Escape rooms first became popular in Asia, and have spread across North America and Europe.",0
" After two weeks stranded at sea and battered by winter storms, migrants onboard a rescue ship are growing frustrated, supplies are dwindling and the crew are exhausted as European countries refuse to offer a safe port of call. The Sea-Watch 3, a vessel run by a German humanitarian group, plucked 32 people from an unsafe boat off the coast of Libya on Dec. 22, including three small children who are suffering from seasickness and four teenagers, who are travelling alone. The vessel is now in Maltese waters sheltering from high winds and rough seas. In an act of desperation, one migrant jumped into the frigid waters on Friday, trying to swim for shore, but was quickly pulled back on board by the crew. “We are here on this boat and we do not understand what is happening,” Bob Kiangala, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, told Reuters. “We are not fish, we are not sharks, we are human beings like everyone else. We made this crossing, we risked our lives to get to Europe, and now that we have arrived, Europe refuses, and we do not know why,” he said. Another German humanitarian group, Sea-Eye, is also in waters off Malta with 17 people rescued on Dec. 29 on board its ship. This week almost two dozen humanitarian groups, including Amnesty International and the United Nations’ International Organisation for Migration, called on the European Union to offer a safe port to both vessels. Until June last year, Italy took in almost all of the migrants rescued by humanitarian groups, but since then the new populist coalition government’s Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who leads the anti-immigrant League party, has closed the ports to rescue ships. In a surprising move, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star Movement, said that Italy would take in the women and children if Malta allowed the ships to dock. “Malta should allow the immediate disembarkation of women and children and send them to Italy,” Di Maio wrote on Facebook on Friday. “Children shouldn’t pay the price of a Europe that turns its back so it cannot see.” However, underscoring tensions within the government over migration, Salvini swiftly replied on his own Facebook page that Italy should not take in any more boat migrants. “Human trafficking must be stopped. People escaping war should come to Italy by plane, as many already do, not by boat. We can send medicines, food and clothes to the boats, but enough of this blackmail,” he wrote. “I have not changed my mind.” In recent months Spain and Malta have agreed to take in some rescued migrants, but often not before long negotiations with other EU countries. As a consequence, most humanitarian groups have abandoned sea rescue efforts. Crew members on the Sea-Watch 3 are in good spirits but tired, getting an average of about five hours sleep a night, and the migrants, many of whom endured months of abuse in Libya after making a dangerous desert crossing, are showing signs of stress and mental fatigue, Sea-Watch’s head of mission, Philipp Hahn, said. Sixteen-year-old Achuil Abdallah, who set off alone from his native South Sudan, said he is relieved to have escaped Libya and now is just hoping to reach dry land: “We all need help.” Additional reporting by Angelo Amante, Writing by Steve Scherer; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Crispian Balmer All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"3 MIN READ LONDON, Jan 4 - Lending to British consumers grew at its slowest pace in nearly four years in November and the number of mortgage approvals fell, Bank of England data showed, adding to signs of a pre-Brexit slowdown in the economy. The annual growth rate in unsecured consumer lending slowed to 7.1 percent from 7.4 percent in October, the BoE figures showed, the slowest increase since March 2015. There have been signs from many retailers that British consumers reined in their spending in late 2018, faced with the possibility of the country leaving the European Union without a deal to smooth the economic shock. Prime Minister Theresa May faces a make-or-break vote on her Brexit plans in the week of Jan. 14, little more than two months before Britain is due to end its membership of the EU. A survey of Britain’s dominant services industry published on Friday suggested the economy grew by just 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with the previous three months, as uncertainty about Brexit mounted. The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to 63,728 in November, the lowest figure since April and down from 66,709 in October. The figure was below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. Britain’s housing market weakened in 2018 with major mortgage lenders reporting price growth at a five-year low. Nationwide said earlier on Friday that prices fell in December by the most in monthly terms since mid-2012 and rose at their slowest annual pace in nearly six years. The BoE data showed net mortgage lending, which tends to lag behind approvals, at 3.453 billion pounds in November, up from 4.089 billion pounds in October. BoE Governor Mark Carney warned last month that in the event of a “disorderly” departure from the EU — which is not the central bank’s base-case scenario — house prices could slump by 30 percent as part of a broader economic shock. The central bank has also said demand for consumer lending had been subdued by Brexit uncertainty, but might ramp up again once the situation is clearer. Figures for November alone showed a 924 million-pound net increase in consumer lending, slightly weaker than economists’ forecasts. The BoE also said net gilt purchases by foreign investors totalled 2.387 billion pounds in November compared with a revised lower 5.014 billion pounds in October and 8.649 billion pounds in November 2017.",0
" The Northern Irish party that props up Prime Minister Theresa May’s government said on Friday that it would not support her Brexit deal but that businesses should be relaxed about leaving the EU without an agreement. “In fact we’re more alarmed about what is coming out from the EU and especially the Irish government,” the Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson said when asked if he was reassured by signals from Brussels. May still hopes to get her deal through parliament, though even members of her own cabinet admit privately that to do so she will need to make significant changes and win over lots of opposition lawmakers. If the lower house of the British parliament does not approve May’s deal then the world’s fifth-largest economy will leave the EU without one on March 29 at 2300 GMT as the date is set in law - the 2018 Withdrawal Act. The Northern Irish DUP, whose 10 lawmakers have propped up May’s minority government, has demanded she ditch the Irish backstop, something the EU and May have ruled out. The DUP’s Wilson told BBC radio that the Irish backstop was a “con trick” and added that farmers and businesses should be totally relaxed about a no-deal Brexit. “If anyone should be worried about the tariffs on beef and sheep then it should be the Irish because of course, we, the United Kingdom are net importers of food,” Wilson said. Facing the defeat of her deal last month, May postponed a parliamentary vote on it, pledging to seek “legal and political assurances” from the EU. Those efforts appear so far to be in vain. The EU said it will not reopen the negotiation though it signalled it might offer some concessions. May needs 318 votes to get a deal through parliament yet 117 of her 317 lawmakers voted against her in a confidence vote on Dec. 12. So she will need the support of some of the Labour Party’s 257 lawmakers or to win over swathes of her own party and the DUP.",0
" U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton has warned the Syrian government it should not see the impending U.S. military withdrawal from the country as an invitation to use chemical weapons. U.S. President Donald Trump said in December that U.S. troops had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State militants and were no longer needed in the country. The announcement, which took officials in Washington and allies abroad by surprise, contributed to Jim Mattis’ decision to resign as U.S. defence secretary and prompted concern that Islamic State could stage a comeback. “There is absolutely no change in the U.S. position against the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and absolutely no change in our position that any use of chemical weapons would be met by a very strong response, as we’ve done twice before,” Bolton told reporters on his plane shortly before landing in Tel Aviv, Israel. “So the regime, the Assad regime, should be under no illusions on that question,” said Bolton, who is on a four-day trip to Israel and Turkey. Trump has twice bombed Syria over the government’s alleged use of chemical weapons, in April 2017 and April 2018. In September a senior U.S. official said there was evidence showing chemical weapons were being prepared by Syrian government forces in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in the country. More than half a million people have died during the Syrian war and 11 million have been forced to flee their homes. During his trip Bolton is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. He said he was not suggesting Syria appeared ready to use chemical weapons. “As we elaborate how the (U.S. troop) withdrawal is going to occur and the circumstances, we don’t want the Assad regime to see what we do as representing any diminution in our opposition to the use of weapons of mass destruction,” he said. If chemical weapons were to be used, “a lot of options would be on the table ... if they don’t heed the lessons of those two strikes the next one will be more telling,” Bolton said.",0
" Rakhine insurgents killed 13 policemen and injured nine in attacks on four police posts in Myanmar’s Rakhine state on Friday as the country marked Independence Day, the official news agency said. Fighting resurged in Rakhine state in early December between government forces and the rebel Arakan Army, which wants greater autonomy for Rakhine, where the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group makes up the majority. The Arakan Army does not cite religion as a factor in its insurgency. It was also in the restive western state that a military-led crackdown in 2017, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents, prompted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee westwards to neighbouring Bangladesh. The separate conflict between the military and Arakan Army rebels forced 2,500 civilians from their homes by the end of last year, according to the United Nations. The Arakan Army says it has been fighting for nearly a decade for self-determination in “the land of Arakan,” another name for Rakhine. An independent kingdom ruled in the coastal area until the 18th century. The Arakan Army is one of multiple armed groups fighting in the name of ethnic minorities in the rugged borderlands of Myanmar, a country once known as Burma where around 90 percent of people are Buddhists. The official Myanmar News Agency said four police posts in the Buthidaung area in northern Rakhine came under attack from hundreds of Arakan Army fighters after daybreak on Friday. Thirteen policemen were killed and nine injured as police were forced to abandon two of the posts, it said, adding that the military was now conducting a “clearance” of the area. Myanmar military spokesman Zaw Min Tun said the insurgents had hit police outposts near the border with Bangladesh. “These police posts are there to protect the national races in the area so (Arakan Army rebels) shouldn’t attack them,” Zaw Min Tun said, referring to mostly Buddhist ethnic groups in the area who are, unlike Rohingya Muslims, considered Myanmar citizens. Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha confirmed the assault and said rebels later retrieved the corpses of seven “enemies”. He said later that rebels had freed at least 12 members of the security forces it detained in the fighting. The attacks, he added, came in response to a Myanmar military offensive against the Arakan Army in recent weeks that had also targeted civilians. The military has denied targeting civilians. The Myanmar military last month announced a four-month halt to fighting in the north and northeast of the country to kick-start peace talks with armed groups seeking autonomy, but that announcement excluded Rakhine state. The Myanmar police force said on Saturday it had opened cases against those involved in Friday’s attack under Myanmar’s Counter-Terrorism Law and a weapons law. “This is a carefully planned premeditated attack to harm the lives and property of the people and to further aggravate the instability in the Rakhine State,” the English-language Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said on Saturday. Friday’s violence erupted shortly after the national flag was raised across the southeast Asian country to mark 71 years since independence from Britain, but the Arakan Army spokesman denied any connection between the attacks and the anniversary. “We are not independent yet. Today is not our Independence Day,” Khine Thu Kha said. Last August, a U.N. report accused the Myanmar military of mass killings and rapes of Rohingya with “genocidal intent” in 2017 in an operation that drove more than 700,000 of them to flee to Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies. Myanmar has denied the charges, saying its military launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by Muslim militants.",0
" A powerful Iranian council approved an anti-money laundering bill on Saturday, state media reported, a major step towards reforms that would bring Iran into line with global norms and could facilitate foreign trade in the face of U.S sanctions. Iran has been trying to implement standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental organisation that underpins the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Foreign businesses say Iran’s compliance with FATF standards and its removal from the organisation’s blacklist are essential if they are to increase investment, especially after reimposition of the U.S. sanctions on Tehran. However, Iranian hardliners have opposed passing legislation toward compliance with the FATF, arguing it could hamper Iranian financial support for allies such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which the United States lists as a terrorist organisation. Parliament last year passed the anti-money laundering bill, one of four amendments Iran needs to implement to meet FATF requirements, but the Guardian Council, a vetting body, rejected it, saying it was against Islam and the constitution. On Saturday, the Expediency Council, a body intended to resolve disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, approved the bill with some changes, state news agency IRNA said, quoting a member of the council. The move came after Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani - the chief of hardline judiciary - was appointed last week as the head of the Expediency Council. He is the brother of Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament. Seven months after his harsh dismissal of parliamentary efforts to adapt FATF and other international conventions on money laundering, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seems to have warmed to the reforms, a reversal that experts say is aimed at preventing Iran’s economic collapse. In recent months, cities have been rocked by demonstrations as factory workers, teachers, truck drivers and farmers protested against economic hardship. The sanctions have depressed the value of Iran’s rial currency and aggravated annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in November. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran last year and reimposed the sanctions on its banking and energy sectors, hoping to curb its missile and nuclear programmes and counter its growing influence in the Middle East. European signatories of the nuclear deal are still committed to the accord and seek to launch a mechanism, a so-called special purpose vehicle (SPV), aiming to sidestep the U.S. financial system by using an EU intermediary to handle trade with Iran. The director general of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, an advisory body set up by Khamenei, voiced his support for the FATF-related bills on Friday. “It is better to finalise the FATF and CFT (counter financing of terrorism regimes) in the earliest time, so the Europeans have no excuse not to implement the (SPV) mechanism,” Abdolreza Faraji was quoted by semi-official ISNA new agency.",0
" Thailand resumed flights on Saturday to its southern provinces, as the first tropical storm in 30 years slowed and headed into the Andaman Sea, leaving behind a trail of homes damaged by fallen trees or blown-off roofs, and disrupted power networks. Before tropical storm Pabuk hit land in Nakhon Si Thammarat on Friday, arriving from the Gulf of Thailand, airports had shut in the province and nearby Surat Thani and the holiday island of Koh Samui, with all flights cancelled. But on Saturday, the storm lost speed and was downgraded to a depression as it moved off land, weather officials said, although they maintained warnings of torrential rain and possible flash floods in nine provinces. “The strong winds are forecast with waves up to 3 to 5 meters high in both the Gulf and in the Andaman Sea,” the Thai Meteorological Department said in a statement, urging ships to keep to shore and highlighting the risk of sudden water surges. Bangkok Airways, which has a monopoly at the Koh Samui airport, resumed normal operations early on Saturday and added extra flights to assist stranded passengers. The airports at Nakhon Si Thammarat and Surat Thani will resume operations at noon. Most ferry services to Thailand’s southern holiday islands have resumed following suspension for the storm. Over the past few days, more than 28,000 people have been evacuated into shelters across seven provinces, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said in a daily tally on Saturday. Authorities have recorded just one death, after a fishing boat capsized in strong winds near the coast of Pattani province, leaving another of the crew missing, though four more were safe. PTT Exploration and Production Pcl, a unit of state-owned PTT, said it expected to resume operations of oil rigs at Bongkot and Erawan, two of Thailand’s biggest gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand, on Sunday. It had suspended operations there since Monday and brought staff inland.",0
" A court in India set up under anti-money laundering laws declared liquor and aviation tycoon Vijay Mallya a “fugitive economic offender” on Saturday, paving the way for the government to seize his assets, according to Reuters partner ANI. India recently approved a bill empowering authorities to seize assets of super-rich fugitives whose economic offences or crimes involve sums over 1 billion rupees (11.3 million pounds). The bill is part of a push to prosecute a number of accused who have fled India in the last four years even as the country reels from a series of banking scandals, including a $2 billion (1.57 billion pounds) fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank (PNBK.NS) that was uncovered in February. The financial crime fighting agency Enforcement Directorate had sought to declare Mallya a “fugitive economic offender” and to confiscate 125 billion rupees worth of his assets. On Saturday, Mallya became the first person to be declared fugitive under the new law. His lawyer could not be reached for comment. India has been trying to extradite Mallya from Britain after the collapse of his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. It wants to bring fraud charges against the 62-year-old businessman over $1.4 billion in loans Kingfisher took out from Indian banks which the authorities argue he had no intention of repaying. A London court ruled on Monday that Mallya should be extradited to India adding that there was a prima facie case against the tycoon, who moved to Britain in March 2016. Mallya, who co-owned the Formula One motor racing team Force India which went into administration in July, has denied any wrongdoing and says the case against him is politically motivated.",0
" Russia is not willing to exchange Paul Whelan, the former U.S. marine detained in Moscow on suspicion of spying, Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying on Saturday. “I see no reasons to raise this issue in context of exchanges.

" China’s population is set to reach a peak of 1.442 billion in 2029 and start a long period of “unstoppable” decline in 2030, government scholars said in a research report published on Friday. The world’s most populous country must now draw up policies to try to cope with a declining labour force and a rapidly ageing population, according to the summary of the latest edition of the “Green Book of Population and Labor” published by the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). Growth in the working population had now stagnated, the report said, and the rising number of elderly people will have a far-reaching impact on the social and economic development in the country, especially if fertility rates remain low. “From a theoretical point of view, the long-term population decline, especially when it is accompanied by a continuously ageing population, is bound to cause very unfavourable social and economic consequences,” it said. China’s population is expected to fall back to 1.36 billion by the middle of the century, it said, which could mean a decline in the workforce of as much as 200 million. If fertility rates remain unchanged, the population could fall to 1.17 billion by 2065, it said. China decided in 2016 to relax a controversial “one-child policy” aimed at curbing population growth and allow all couples to have two children. However, the country’s birth rate still fell 3.5 percent in 2017 and is expected to have fallen again last year. China’s “dependency rate” - or the proportion of non-working people, including children and the elderly, in the total population - rose for the first time in more than 30 years in 2011, and is widely predicted to increase further for at least the next few decades. The proportion of retirees is projected to rise until 2060, the CASS report said, and while the decision to relax “one-child” rules was designed to rebalance China’s age structure, in the short term it will also lead to a greater dependency rate. According to previous forecasts, China’s elderly population is expected to reach 400 million by the end of 2035, up from around 240 million last year.",0
" A Chinese space probe successfully touched down on the far side of the moon on Thursday, China’s space agency said, hailing the event as a historic first and a major achievement for the country’s space program. The Chang’e-4 lunar probe, launched in December, made the “soft landing” at 0226 GMT and transmitted the first-ever “close range” image of the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration said. The moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate as it orbits our planet, so most of the far side - or “dark side” - is never visible to us. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none has landed on it. The landing “lifted the mysterious veil” of the far side of the moon and “opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration”, the agency said in a statement on its website, which included a wide-angle color picture of a crater from the moon’s surface. The probe, which has a lander and a rover, touched down at a targeted area near the moon’s south pole in the Von Karman Crater after entering the moon’s orbit in mid-December. The tasks of the Chang’e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon’s terrain, landform and mineral makeup, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment of its far side. The control center in Beijing will decide when to let the rover separate from the lander, state news agency Xinhua said. “It’s an important milestone for China’s space exploration,” Wu Weiren, chief designer of the lunar exploration program, said, according to Xinhua. The probe also took six live species - cotton, rapeseed, potato, arabidopsis, fruit fly and yeast - to the lifeless environment to form a mini biosphere, Xinhua said. The landing is the latest step for China in its race to catch up with Russia and the United States and become a major space power by 2030. Beijing plans to launch construction of its own manned space station next year. While China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the U.S. Defense Department has accused it of pursuing activities aiming to prevent other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis. Besides its civilian ambitions, China has tested anti-satellite missiles and the U.S. Congress has banned NASA from two-way cooperation with its Chinese counterpart over security concerns. As competition accelerates in space, U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to create a new “Space Force” by 2020, as the sixth branch of the military. But the private space race is also heating up, as numerous companies aim to commercialize space travel, such as California-based SpaceX, which has upended the industry with its low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. The United States is the only country to have landed humans on the moon, and Trump said in 2017 he wanted to return astronauts to the lunar surface to build a foundation for an eventual Mars mission. NASA administrators have said people could be put on Mars by as soon as the mid-2030s, with the agency having landed eight spacecraft there, the most recent in November. As soon as 2022, NASA expects to begin building a new space station laboratory to orbit the moon, as a pit stop for missions to distant parts of the solar system. In 2003, China became the third country to put a man in space with its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States, and in 2017 it said it was preparing to send a person to the moon. China completed its first lunar “soft landing” in 2013, but its “Jade Rabbit” rover began malfunctioning after several weeks.",0
" A former North Korean diplomat who staged a high-profile defection to the South on Saturday urged an old colleague who has gone missing in Italy to defect to Seoul, following a report that he was seeking asylum in the United States. Jo Song Gil, the 44-year-old who was until recently North Korea’s acting ambassador to Italy, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in early November, South Korean lawmakers said on Thursday. Jo has sought asylum in the United States and is under the protection of Italian intelligence, Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper said on Friday, citing an unidentified diplomatic source. The State Department and the U.S. embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to a query from Reuters. In an open letter, Thae Yong Ho, Pyongyang’s former deputy ambassador to Britain, who said he went to the same university and worked with Jo before defecting to South Korea in 2016, urged Jo to follow in his footsteps. To defect to the South is an “obligation, not a choice” for North Korean diplomats committed to unification, Thae said, calling Seoul “the outpost” for that task. “If you come to South Korea, the day when our suffering colleagues and North Korean citizens are liberated from the fetters would be moved forward,” Thae said in the letter released on his website. “If you come to Seoul, even more of our colleagues would follow suit, and the unification would be accomplished by itself.” Thae said his family visited Jo in Rome in 2008, where the latter was studying from 2006 to 2009. He guided them to sites such as St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City. South Korea could not be “heaven on earth” but a place where Jo can realise his wishes, Thae said, highlighting the ardent desire for unification among many of the roughly 32,000 defectors there. “The defectors may not be as wealthy as South Koreans,” Thae added. “But isn’t it the only thing you and I, as North Korean diplomats, should do the rest of our lives - to bring about unification and hand over a unified nation to our children?” If confirmed to have fled, Jo would be another Europe-based diplomat who has sought to leave the impoverished, oppressive North under the rule of Kim Jong Un. In 2015, a counsellor in charge of science affairs at the North’s embassy in Germany defected with his wife to an unidentified country, while a secretary-level trade official stationed in Bulgaria and his wife also fled, Thae told South Korean cable news Channel A in an interview this week. South Korean officials said they could not comment on intelligence matters. Europe could be a safer place for North Korean diplomats than elsewhere due to its openness to receiving asylum seekers, defectors and experts say. North Korea has formal diplomatic ties with 26 European nations, as well as Britain and Germany, since 2013, Seoul’s Unification Ministry says. Pyongyang requires diplomats going overseas to leave at least one child at home, but those from the top echelons or seen as the most loyal to the regime get some exceptions. Jo hailed from a wealthy family of diplomats, and was able to take his child on his posting to Italy in 2015, Thae said. “Diplomats in Europe are well-connected and sensitive to political changes at home, which allow them to make a move quickly,” said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean military officer and defector. Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a North Korea specialist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, said Europe offered a “more open, safer environment” for North Korean officials to discuss sensitive issues and consider defection. “Also, Western European countries, such as Italy or the United Kingdom, are very likely to approve the asylum application or support the defection of any North Korean official who asks for it,” said Pacheco Pardo, who regularly meets North Korean officials and defectors in Europe.",0
" A second referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union would only exacerbate divisions among the British people, Brexit minister Stephen Barclay told a German newspaper. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said last month there would be a “plausible argument” for another referendum if parliament failed to reach a consensus on the way forward, something Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out. Barclay echoed May’s view. “A second referendum would cause yet more division,” he told German daily Die Welt. “The current extent to which Britain is divided now would be small compared to the tensions that a second vote would cause. It would further divide our nation.” The future of a Brexit agreement that May negotiated with the EU hangs in the balance in the run-up to a parliamentary vote, and calls for a second referendum - which she has consistently rejected - are growing. Brexit is scheduled for March 29. Barclay said a second referendum could not be organised before elections to the European Parliament in May. “But then, European elections would have to take place in Britain,” he added. “Which means huge democratic damage, because people voted for a withdrawal but would have to nonetheless vote again at the end of May.” “Our European colleagues couldn’t have any interest in it (a second referendum) either as that would trigger a very populist reaction,” he said. British lawmakers must choose whether to accept May’s plans for a structured exit and relatively close economic ties to the EU, or reject it and spawn huge uncertainty about the country’s next steps. The vote is due in the week beginning Jan. 14. Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by James Dalgleish All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s (BMY.N) announcement that it would buy Celgene Corp (CELG.O) for $74 billion (59 billion pounds) has raised investors’ hopes that a wave of consolidation among drugmakers could be coming. The following are some of the companies in the sector whose shares rose on Thursday on takeover speculation following the deal announcement: INCYTE CORP (INCY.O), ENDED TRADING UP 7 PERCENT The failure of an Incyte immunotherapy drug in combination with Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Keytruda in a melanoma trial last year sent its shares reeling. But analysts have said its bone marrow disorder treatment, Jakafi, has become a meaningful new revenue opportunity for the company. At a $15 billion market capitalisation, Incyte remains a digestible size for larger players such as Gilead Sciences Inc and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA). RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note on Thursday that Incyte is an acquisition target because it is undervalued and has an oncology and inflammation pipeline. GILEAD SCIENCES INC (GILD.O), ENDED TRADING UP 3 PERCENT Gilead has a hefty $85 billion market capitalisation, making it only a target for the largest global drugmakers. Its product portfolio targets HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, cancer, inflammatory and respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular conditions. The company recently named a new CEO, Daniel O’Day, who previously headed Roche Holdings AG’s (ROG.S) pharmaceutical business. O’Day is expected to help Gilead build out its global presence, especially in liver disease beyond hepatitis C, oncology and inflammation. ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS INC (ALXN.O), ENDED TRADING UP 2 PERCENT Rare disease specialist Alexion, which has faced pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management could be an acquisition target for companies such as Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) or Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), analysts have said. Extremely expensive drugs for ultra rare diseases have become increasingly attractive to larger drugmakers. Raymond James analysts said in a research note that M&A could happen this year involving companies focused on the huge unmet need for treating the progressive fatty liver disease known as NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), which does not yet have any approved treatments. Even though their shares did not get a boost on Thursday, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL.O) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT.O) are among the leaders developing treatments to tap a market that could eventually be worth $30 billion. As they race towards regulatory approval for NASH, these companies could become targets for larger biotechs. Allergan, for example, bought Tobira in 2016 for its experimental NASH drug for $1.8 billion, 19 times what the stock market was valuing the company. RBC’s investor survey showed Intercept, which was a market value of $2.8 billion, was a favoured takeout candidate by investors for this year. Several other small companies are also developing promising NASH drugs.",0
" Ireland posted its first underlying budget surplus for a decade in 2018, a year ahead of government forecasts, as high windfall taxes and low interest payments ended a decade of deficits, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday. Ireland’s deficit ballooned into double figures in 2009 when property prices collapsed, sparking a banking crisis and a three-year international bailout. But the Irish economy posted the fastest growth in the European Union every year since 2014 and the country’s corporate tax take more than doubled since 2012. The exchequer recorded a budget surplus of 106 million euros (£95.6 million) in 2018, and the government expects to run another in 2019, the finance ministry said. The Irish exchequer posted a technical surplus of 1.9 billion euros in 2017 but once a 3.4 billion euro windfall from the sale of shares in Allied Irish Banks was excluded, it showed an underlying deficit. The exchequer was 1.6 billion euros better off in 2018 than 2017, the finance ministry said. “This is the first time in 10 years that we have recorded a budget surplus,” Varadkar said. “It means that we are very well prepared for a downturn or for an economic shock if that were to affect us.” “We would expect to do the same in 2019 but its absolutely something we can’t take for granted or be complacent about,” he added. Total budget expenditure in 2018 was about 250 million euros less than forecast, largely due to lower than planned interest payments on the country’s national debt, Varadkar said. Meanwhile corporate tax receipts, much of which come from a small number of U.S. multinationals who book profits in Ireland, were 1.9 billion euros higher than expected, the finance ministry said. Varadkar said, however, that Ireland was “not taking for granted” that corporate tax receipts would continue to exceed expectations. “We are actually projecting a fall off in tax take from corporations. So if they pay the same amount in 2019 as they did in 2018 it will be a pleasant surprise,” he said.",0
" Wildfires burned in parts of Australia’s densely-populated southeast on Saturday, although weather officials expected falling temperatures to bring relief for Sydney by early afternoon. One fire in eastern Victoria, the second most populous state, prompted fire authorities to issue a watch and act warning for residents in 14 different towns. The fire near Rosedale, about 200 km (124 miles) east of Melbourne, had burnt more than 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) and sudden wind changes on Friday created risky conditions for roughly 40 firefighters, an emergency official said. “They found themselves in a very serious situation and they were shaken,” Andrew Crisp, the state’s emergency management commissioner, told reporters on Saturday. The origin of the Rosedale fire and another in Victoria were being treated as suspicious, with police and fire authorities investigating their cause, he added. In the southern island state of Tasmania, a bushfire had burnt through 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of southwestern wilderness by Saturday, fire officials said. Both Victoria and Tasmania had sweltered through above average temperatures on Friday, with Melbourne recording a near-record 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 F) and Hobart reaching 40 C (104 F).. But both states will see far cooler temperatures over the weekend, following a rapid cool change on Friday, weather officials said. “At 4.00 p.m., (Melbourne) was at 42 degrees, by 4.20 p.m. it was down to 26 degrees, and then continued to drop after that,” Keris Arndt, a meteorologist with the weather bureau, told Reuters. Yet by Saturday morning the cooling temperatures had not reached parts of Sydney, Australia’s most populous city, where the mercury reached almost 38 C (100.4 F) by midday. A Bureau of Meteorology forecaster told Reuters the weather pattern that brought temperature drops to Melbourne and Tasmania was expected to reach Sydney by afternoon.",0
" China’s armed forces must strengthen their sense of urgency and do everything they can to prepare for battle, President Xi Jinping told a meeting of top brass on Friday. China is keen to beef up its armed forces amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea and escalating tension with the United States over issues ranging from trade to the status of Taiwan. The official Xinhua news agency said Xi told a meeting of the top military authority that China faced increasing risks and challenges, and the armed forces must work to secure its security and development needs. Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, said the armed forces must devise strategies for the new era and take on responsibilities for preparing and waging war. “The world is facing a period of major changes never seen in a century, and China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development,” he was quoted as saying. He said the armed forces needed to be able to respond quickly to emergencies, needed to upgrade their joint operations capabilities and nurture new types of combat forces. Xi’s comments followed his remarks on Wednesday that China still reserved the right to use force to achieve “reunification” with Taiwan and prevent the island’s independence. Xi’s Taiwan speech came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act into law, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the island’s security.",0
" President Donald Trump threatened to keep the U.S. government partially shut for months or years on Friday after he and Democratic leaders failed to resolve their dispute over Trump’s request for $5.6 billion (4.4 billion pounds) to build a wall on the Mexican border. After Democratic congressional leaders refused Trump’s requests at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of declaring a national emergency and building the wall without congressional approval. Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures money for the wall. As a result, around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. “He resisted,” Schumer said. “In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.” Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday. “We had a very, very productive meeting, and we’ve come a long way,” Trump said. According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for billions of dollars to fund a border wall. The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment. The president later told reporters that Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said Democrats were not looking to impeach him. Raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States. A reporter asked Trump whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall. “Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want,” Trump said. “We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country ... I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it’s another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving that a shot.” Emergency powers have been invoked by previous U.S. presidents during times of war. Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the comments, saying in a statement, “Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.” The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power to fund the federal government, so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump’s main promises when he ran for president in 2016. Trump’s wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion. Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval. Pelosi said Friday’s meeting with Trump was “sometimes contentious” but that they agreed to continue talking. “But we recognise on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,” she said. Credit rating agency Moody’s said the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blames Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blames Republican lawmakers, while 32 percent blames Democrats. In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be “proud” to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible. White House officials and congressional staffers will meet at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Saturday to try to end the impasse, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend. The partial shutdown is straining the country’s immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers. Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labour, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown. House Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal, a Democrat, asked the Internal Revenue Service in a letter on Friday to explain the possible effects of the shutdown on the upcoming tax filing season for millions of Americans.",0
" Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday he owns no real estate, vehicles or personal property, echoing what experts say is a pattern among the country’s politicians of shifting assets to relatives. Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, told a regular news conference his family’s cars and home are in his wife’s name. The veteran leftist won a landslide victory in July after a campaign centered on rooting out corruption in Mexico, which experts say is among the worst in Latin America. Heg cuts an austere figure, ditching the presidential residence, flying coach and driving a white Volkswagen Jetta. Transparency advocates welcome Lopez Obrador’s disclosure after battling to get members of his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration to open up about their finances, said Alexandra Zapata of the Mexican Institution for Competitiveness (IMCO), a think-tank that promotes good governance and fighting corruption. But his declaration raised as many questions about his wealth as it answered, she added. “The president, in an effort to send this message of austerity, loses credibility in how he talks about his property, his assets and his interests,” said Zapata, who is the group’s director of education and civic innovation. Lopez Obrador disclosed monthly net income of 108,744 pesos (4,399.77 pounds) from his government work and savings worth 446,068 pesos. In addition to real estate and vehicles, Lopez Obrador’s personal possessions and household goods, including works of art and other valuable objects, were disclosed in his wife’s name, a spokesman for the president’s office said. Mexican politicians have long been accused of obscuring their wealth by registering assets under relatives’ names. Those who absorb the assets are sometimes referred to as “prestanombres,” or people who lend their names. Lopez Obrador has slashed salaries for public officials, including his own, and stressed on Friday that others in his administration would be required to declare their assets, too. The president said during the news conference that his principal asset had been a property in the southern state of Chiapas, which he inherited from his parents and is now registered under his children’s names. “Money has never interested me,” he said. “I fight for ideals, for principles.” Under a new national anti-corruption system, federal, state and local officials will soon be required to submit detailed disclosures about their income and assets, as well as those of their families. Lopez Obrador has long cast himself as a man of the people in a poor country. During the news conference, he said he has no credit card, a common refrain in his speeches. Just 37 percent of Mexicans had an account with a bank or other type of financial institution in 2017, according to a World Bank study of people over 15 years old. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who backed another candidate in the election, criticized the disclosure. “Only his grandmother could believe this,” Fox wrote in a post on Twitter. “Wake up, Mexico!!!”",0
" Washington state will create a streamlined system to pardon people convicted of misdemeanour marijuana possession before the drug was legal, under an initiative launched on Friday by Governor Jay Inslee, who is considering a run for U.S. president. Voters in Washington state and Colorado in 2012 made their two states the first in the United States to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Since then, eight other states have followed suit, while more than 30 states allow the use of medical marijuana. Federal law still bans cannabis. “We shouldn’t be punishing people for something that is no longer illegal in Washington state,” Inslee, a Democrat, said in a written statement. Under the governor’s so-called Marijuana Justice Initiative, anyone with a single misdemeanour marijuana conviction in Washington state between 1998 and 2012 could apply for a pardon. An estimated 3,500 people are eligible, according to Inslee’s office. Some people with past convictions have faced obstacles in applying for jobs and housing. Racial disparities in the prosecution of marijuana offences have hurt African Americans and other minorities, and civil rights groups have pushed politicians to take up the issue. “This (action by Inslee) is a necessary first step for repairing the racially disparate harms of marijuana prohibition,” Jolene Forman, a senior staff attorney with the Drug Policy Alliance, which has long pushed for pot legalization, said in a statement. Since 2014, at least 10 states have passed laws to expunge certain marijuana convictions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A measure in the Washington state legislature that would have erased certain misdemeanour marijuana convictions failed to pass last year. In the absence of that legislation, Inslee exercised his executive authority to create a pardon system, said his spokeswoman Jaime Smith. It applies only to people with a single conviction because officials did not want to be overwhelmed with applications, she said. Brad Klippert, a Republican member of the state House of Representatives, said he would have preferred the governor pardon only the most “extreme cases.” “I personally think it’s a horrible idea because marijuana is a very dangerous drug and that’s why it’s still illegal according to the federal government,” he said. Washington state law, before legalization, had classified possession of less than 40 grams of marijuana as a misdemeanour, with larger amounts treated as a felony.",0
" The new Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives is quietly planning behind the scenes for a series of investigations of Republican President Donald Trump, but no immediate flurry of subpoenas materialized as some Democrats had hoped. Democratic leaders began their new era of control with caution, reflecting their persistent concern that acting too quickly to press investigations of Trump’s ties with Russia or his personal tax records may be perceived as overreach and cause a backlash in the next election cycle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rolled out legislative proposals on Friday, including one to require presidential candidates to disclose publicly 10 years worth of tax returns, a direct response to Trump’s refusal to release his. Such caution contrasted with urgent demands from newer members of the House Democratic caucus, which took majority control on Thursday, for tough, swift action. Representative Rashida Tlaib was filmed late on Thursday at a reception saying that Democrats were going to try to remove Trump from office, telling the crowd, “We’re going to impeach that motherfucker.” Her remark drew rebukes from Republicans and Democrats. House Republican Whip Steve Scalise said: “Pelosi’s got her first test and it happened on day one. How is she going to stand up to the most radical left elements of her party when they become unhinged?” During a White House news conference, Trump said Tlaib’s comment was a “dishonor to herself and to her family.” Trump had earlier tweeted that Democrats were discussing impeachment because they feared running against him in the 2020 election, when he will seek a second four-year term. “Everybody has got their own style, it ain’t mine,” House Majority Whip James Clyburn told reporters, referring to Tlaib. “I don’t believe we ought to be talking about impeachment until we get this country back on track.” Tlaib defended her comments in an interview with a Detroit television station on Friday. “It’s probably exactly how my grandmother, if she was alive, would say it,” she told NBC-affiliate WDIV. “I stand by impeaching the president of the United States,” Tlaib said. “I ran on that.” Whether or not impeachment proceedings follow, Democrats have been firm that they will closely scrutinize Trump, his business interests and the first two years of his presidency. Trump’s time in the White House so far has been clouded by a U.S. special counsel’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination between Moscow officials and the Trump campaign. Democrats also charge that several of Trump’s top aides and cabinet officials have violated legal and ethical standards - a subject they believe is ripe for investigation. “President Trump set the tone from the top of his administration that behaving ethically and complying the law is optional, ladies and gentleman, I stopped by here to say we’re better than that. It will not be optional,” Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings told a room of cheering staffers, offering a hint of what could be to come. Adam Schiff, the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee circulated a memo in early 2018 that is now seen as a blueprint for the Democrats’ investigative agenda. Schiff maintains that committee Republicans prematurely abandoned their inquiry into Russian interference. Moscow denies meddling in the election and Trump denies collusion. For instance, committee Republicans “refused” to interview White House officials Stephen Miller and Kellyanne Conway, former Trump White House aides Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer and private Trump advisors Allen Weisselberg and Alan Garten, the Schiff memo said, providing a list of possible witnesses that could be called by Democrats. Documents about Trump deals and finances from Deutsche Bank, should be obtained “via subpoena if necessary,” the memo said.",0
" Mexico’s new leftist government on Friday called on its peers to refrain from interfering in Venezuela’s internal affairs, declining to back a regional declaration that urged Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro not to take office on Jan. 10. Mexico was the sole country in the 14-member Lima Group that opted not to sign a statement critical of Maduro, the first time Mexico has not supported a declaration by the group since it was created in 2017 to push for democratic reforms in Venezuela. Mexico was once among the most outspoken critics of Maduro. But ties with Venezuela have warmed under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who invited Maduro to his inauguration last month. Maximiliano Reyes, Mexico’s deputy foreign minister responsible for Latin America, said following a Lima Group meeting in Peru that Mexico was concerned about the “situation regarding human rights” in Venezuela but would not comment on the legitimacy of its government. Instead, he asked the Lima Group to rethink its approach. “We call for reflection in the Lima Group about the consequences for Venezuelans of measures that seek to interfere in internal affairs,” Reyes said in a statement. In a Friday evening state television broadcast, Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Maduro would take office on Jan. 10 in a “legitimate and constitutional” process, which he said “does not require the approval of any foreign government.” He said Venezuela was “perplexed” by the statement and that the country would take reciprocal action for diplomatic steps taken by any other government. Reyes called for mediation and dialogue from the Lima Group, not isolation. Mexico’s stance was a blow to regional efforts to ramp up pressure on Maduro ahead of his inauguration, which Venezuela’s opposition hoped would be a watershed moment to highlight how he has undermined democracy and mismanaged the OPEC member’s economy. Still, Mexico did not appear to be lining up any heavyweight representation for the inauguration. Asked who would attend from Mexico, a foreign ministry spokesman said it would be the Mexican embassy’s charge d’affairs. Diplomatic measures against Venezuela from neighbouring countries remain timid, and Friday’s communique added little to previous statements that urged Maduro to step down but offered few concrete mechanisms to make this happen. Peru said last month that it would propose ending diplomatic relations with Venezuela to Lima Group members. But no country has yet announced it would sever ties. The 13 remaining countries in the Lima Group that signed Friday’s statement, which include Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia, called Maduro’s new term “illegitimate” and urged him to hand power over to the National Assembly until democratic elections can be held. They also said they would seek to bar high-ranking Venezuelan officials from entering their territory or having access to their financial systems.",0
" Federal police took steps to close a migrant shelter in Mexico’s city of Tijuana on Friday, sparking protests from some of the dozens of U.S.-bound people who had been staying there after travelling in a caravan from Central America. The arrival of several thousand migrants in recent months, many fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, has challenged Mexico’s new president to make good on pledges to protect migrants in Mexico, just as the United States makes it increasingly hard for them to cross the border. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who began his presidency last month, has yet to detail how he will improve what he has described as deplorable conditions for people trekking thousands of miles across Mexico to the U.S. border. Officials in mid-December said that, of the nearly 6,000 migrants who had arrived in Tijuana in recent caravans, about half were at a large shelter in a former concert venue and another several hundred had dispersed to other shelters in the city, such as the one being closed. About 1,000 had crossed into the United States, while another 1,000 returned to their home countries. Tijuana officials cited sanitary reasons for closing the shelter, a two-story warehouse in a zone known for crime and prostitution near the border. The industrial site was overcrowded, poorly lit and lacked proper facilities for food preparation, said Isain Venegas, a supervisor in Mexico’s public health system. Common illnesses had been treated, he added. Officials told migrants that they could move to the bigger shelter, run by the federal government, about 7 miles (11 km) from the border. Many migrants protested, saying they did not expect other sites to be any better. “Not one of the shelters in Tijuana has the conditions for them to keep us in ... the authorities are tricking us,” said Honduran migrant Reinerio Laine. By mid-afternoon, several dozen migrants had refused to leave and were joined by U.S. activists, as federal and local police in riot gear took formation at the entrance. Others packed belongings and set off on foot to nearby shelters, while several dozen waited for a bus that would bring them to the larger, government-run facility. “We had hoped that now with President Lopez Obrador he could see the conditions we’re in. They said he was going to help, but they’ve treated us worse than animals,” said Maria Claros, 28, from Honduras. “We don’t have anywhere to wash or do our business. I bathe with cold water when I have 20 pesos to pay for it,” she added. For decades, Tijuana, a notoriously crime-ridden border city, has attracted migrants headed north. When Central Americans began arriving in large numbers in November, officials provided lodging at a sports centre, but closed it after rains flooded the venue. Last month, two boys from Honduras were killed outside a shelter for migrant youths.",0
" Nigeria’s President Buhari on Friday acknowledged that an electoral commissioner is an extended family member by marriage, but denied claims by the main opposition party that she is a blood relative, ahead of the country’s Feb. 16 presidential election. Elections in Africa’s most populous nation have for years been marred by allegations of irregularities including vote rigging, voter intimidation, cronyism and violence. The People’s Democratic Party on Thursday accused Buhari and the Independent National Electoral Commission of plotting to rig the election with the appointment of Amina Zakari, whom the party said is Buhari’s niece. “President Buhari and Commissioner Amina Zakari don’t share a family relationship,” a spokesperson for the president tweeted on Friday. “An inter-marriage occurred in their extended families, so the imputation of blood relationship between the President and the electoral commissioner is a simple lie,” he added. In a statement on Thursday, the People’s Democratic Party rejected Zakari’s appointment as “head of the collation of results,” calling her a “blood relation.” A commission spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Buhari, who is seeking a second term, reassured voters in October that the election would be free and fair after international observers raised concerns over how a gubernatorial vote was conducted at the time.

" Democratic Republic of Congo’s electoral commission accused the country’s Catholic Church on Friday of “preparing an insurrection” by saying it knows the winner of last Sunday’s presidential election. The commission is scheduled to release provisional results on Sunday but has said there could be delays because of the slow arrival of tally sheets. Donatien Nshole, the secretary-general of the Church’s bishops’ conference, known as CENCO, said on Thursday its vote tallies showed a clear victor in the Dec. 30 election, a pronouncement widely seen as a warning to authorities against rigging the vote. “The announcement of voting trends by Priest Nshole is likely to brainwash the population while preparing an insurrection that CENCO alone will be responsible for,” commission president Corneille Nangaa wrote in a letter to CENCO president Marcel Utembi, seen by Reuters. Nangaa said CENCO’s declaration violated electoral law and a code of conduct signed by poll monitors that gives the electoral commission, CENI, alone the authority to announce results. The Catholic Church is one of Congo’s most powerful institutions, representing about 40 percent of its 80 million people. The ruling coalition of President Joseph Kabila, which is backing his hand-picked successor Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, also took aim at CENCO on Thursday. The coalition “deplores ... the partisan, irresponsible and anarchic attitude of CENCO,” said Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, an adviser to Kabila and spokesman for Shadary. The U.N. Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on the latest developments on Friday at the request of France. French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said the 15-member body would continue to monitor the electoral process in Congo. “The consolidation of the results must continue with transparency,” Delattre told reporters. “We call on all actors for calm and restraint.” Observers and the opposition say the election was marred by serious irregularities. The opposition, represented by its two main candidates Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, and Shadary’s camp have all claimed they are on course to win, without posting specific figures. Kikaya told Reuters Kabila had met Catholic bishops on Friday but provided no details. The government says the election was fair and went smoothly. The poll is meant to lead to Congo’s first democratic transfer of power, but the international community has raised concerns that a disputed result could cause unrest, as was the case after the 2006 and 2011 elections. President Donald Trump said on Friday about 80 U.S. military personnel had deployed to Gabon in case they were needed to protect American citizens and diplomatic facilities in Congo. On Thursday, the United States called on CENI to publish accurate results and threatened sanctions against anyone who sought to undermine the process. An election dispute could further destabilise Congo’s volatile eastern provinces, where wars around the turn of the century resulted in millions of deaths, most from hunger and disease, and where dozens of militia remain active. Kabila’s government cut access to the internet as well as Radio France Internationale (RFI) and some local media this week, saying it wanted to prevent fake results from circulating. “This being a very sensitive, a very tense period, we are concerned that these efforts to silence dissent could backfire considerably when the results are announced,” Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters in Geneva. “We are calling on all sides to refrain from the use of violence,” she said. The European Union also called on election authorities to ensure the results reflect the will of the Congolese people. Opinion polls had shown Shadary trailing Fayulu and Tshisekedi, who have been buoyed by rising dissatisfaction with Kabila’s tenure. Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, helped reunify the country amid civil war and has presided over strong economic growth, driven by exports of copper and cobalt, a component of electric car batteries. But critics say there has been little improvement in the quality of life for average Congolese and accuse the government of brutally suppressing dissent.

" Workers at Amazon’s biggest warehouse in Spain started a two-day strike on Thursday just ahead of a gift-giving feast day, as part of a long-running campaign for better pay and conditions. The strike, called by the country’s two main unions, CCOO and UGT, may affect the delivery of products for Epiphany, the day on which three kings brought gifts to Jesus in Christian tradition, which most Spaniards mark by exchanging presents. “We have been protesting for a year. This is the richest company in the world and they want to keep profiting by taking away workers’ rights,” said David Matarraz, an Amazon worker outside the warehouse close to Madrid. Amazon workers in Germany and Poland have also walked off the job, demanding better conditions. German and Spanish workers went on strike two months ago on Black Friday, the discount spending spree that kicks off the Christmas shopping season, but Amazon said this had no impact on customer orders. Seventy percent of employees at the Spanish center joined Thursday’s strike, CCOO representative Douglas Harper said. An Amazon spokesman denied this, saying most employees at the center had been at work on Thursday. Employees at the Madrid center earn a minimum 19,300 euros ($21,933) per year, the spokesman said. Spain’s legal monthly minimum wage is 1,050 euros. Protesters at the site lit a bonfire and a man walked around wearing a mask showing the face of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.",0
" Two French scientists who validated Jeanne Calment’s status as the oldest person ever to have lived, have dismissed claims by Russian researchers who say that she didn’t really survive to 122. Mathematician Nikolay Zak and gerontologist Valery Novoselov claim that Calment’s daughter, Yvonne Calment, assumed her mother’s identity decades earlier. The Russians analyzed photographs, official documents and interviews to produce a body of evidence they acknowledge is circumstantial. Gerentology is the scientific study of old age. Jean-Marie Robine, one of the two French scientists who validated Calment’s age, told France Inter radio late on Wednesday that the stir being caused in France by the Russians’ findings was a “ridiculous controversy”. A spokesman for Guinness World Records, which registered Calment’s age as a world record, said they were aware of the Russians’ claims. “Extensive research is performed for every oldest person record title we verify, which is led by experts in the gerontology field and they have been notified of the current situation,” a spokesman said. In a paper for the Moscow Center For Continuous Mathematical Education, Zak cites discrepancies between the color of Jeanne Calment’s eyes, her height and the shape of her forehead in a copy of a 1930s identity card and in her appearance later in life. “I do not have cast-iron proof,” Zak told Reuters on a snow-blanketed street in Moscow. “I reviewed the whole situation. There are lots of small pieces of evidence.” The second French scientist who validated Calment’s age, gerontologist Michel Allard, acknowledged that even if far-fetched, the Russians’ conclusions should be given consideration, although he rejected their suggestions of discrepancies between early images of Calment and her appearance in later life. “In the last years of Jeanne Calment’s life, I saw so many transformations of her physiognomy,” he told France Inter. Jeanne Calment was born on Feb 21, 1875, more than a decade before the Eiffel Tower was built and a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone. She married a distant wealthy cousin and outlived her daughter Yvonne — who died of pneumonia in the early 1930s according to official documents — her husband and a grandson before passing away in Arles, southern France, on Aug 4, 1997.",0
" The cost to insure Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) debt hit its highest point since May 2010 on Thursday, following the announcement that the U.S. pharmaceutical company would acquire rival Celgene Corp (CELG.O) in a deal worth about $74 billion (£59 billion). As the price of long-dated Bristol-Myers bonds fell, the associated credit default swap BMY5YUSAX=MG jumped 66 percent, bringing the cost to insure $1 million of the company’s debt to $23,000. The moves happened because a portion of the acquisition will be funded by debt, raising the investment-grade company’s credit risk. Bristol-Myers is currently rated A+ by S&P Global Ratings and A2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The $74-billion deal, worth $90 billion with Celgene’s debt incorporated, is the largest healthcare acquisition on record, and will be financed in part by a $33.5-billion bridge loan, the second largest ever U.S. healthcare bridge loan, according to Refinitiv data. Bristol-Myers “will be coming to market later this year to fund the deal with about $28 billion of new debt,” a significant addition to its current debt load of $7.3 billion, said Monica Erickson, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Group. The new debt would push the merged company’s leverage from 1.8 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to 3.5 times, said Erickson. As Bristol-Myers added, Celgene shed credit risk. Celgene is currently rated BBB+/Baa2, two notches above junk status. “It’s good for Celgene bond holders, but not so good for Bristol-Myers bonds holders,” said Erickson. Celgene’s longer-dated bonds rose, particularly for issues with the full amount borrowed still outstanding. A $2 billion bond coming due in 2045 151020AU8= was up 6.6 percent, and the company’s $1.5 billion 2048 bond 151020AZ7= rose 6.3 percent.",0
" President Donald Trump said on Friday that U.S. military personnel had deployed to Gabon in response to possible violent demonstrations in the Democratic Republic of Congo after a presidential election there. In a letter to congressional leaders, Trump said the first of about 80 military personnel arrived in Gabon on Wednesday in case they are needed to protect U.S. citizens and diplomatic facilities in Congo’s capital Kinshasa. He said they “will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes such that their presence is no longer needed.” Trump said additional forces may deploy to Gabon “if necessary.” Congo’s electoral commission is scheduled to release provisional results of the presidential election on Sunday, but it has said there could be delays because of the slow arrival of tally sheets. Observers and the opposition say the election was marred by serious irregularities. Congo’s government says the election was fair and went smoothly.

The international community has raised concerns that a disputed result could cause unrest, as was the case after the 2006 and 2011 elections. On Thursday, the U.S. State Department called on the electoral commission to ensure votes were accurately counted and threatened to impose sanctions against those who undermined the process or threatened peace and stability in the country.",0

" The term of the grand jury being used by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of possible collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign has been extended, an aide to the judge overseeing it said on Friday. The extension is a sign that Mueller is not done presenting evidence before the grand jury in his investigation of U.S. allegations of Russian interference in the election and any possible coordination between Moscow and Trump’s campaign. The grand jury was impanelled by the U.S. District Court in Washington in July 2017 for an 18-month term, the limit under federal rules. The term can be extended if the court determines it to be in the public interest to do so. “The Chief Judge has confirmed that the term of Grand Jury 17-01 has been extended,” Lisa Klem, special assistant to Chief Judge Beryl Howell said in a statement. Howell did not confirm any length of the extension, Klem said. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. A number of Trump’s allies, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly called on Mueller to wrap up his investigation. Trump has called the investigation a “witch hunt” and has denied collusion with Moscow. Russia has denied meddling in the election, contrary to the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that have said Moscow used hacking and propaganda to try to sow discord in the United States and boost Republican Trump’s chances against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Mueller’s investigation and other inquiries have clouded Trump’s two years in office. Mueller has secured more than 30 indictments and guilty pleas and has spawned at least four federal probes. reporting by Nathan Layne in New York; editing by Grant McCool All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" A routine U.S.-hosted conference of nations fighting the Islamic State militant group has become a damage control effort following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. The previously scheduled conference, tentatively set for Feb. 7 in Washington, aims to gather ministers from many of the 79 nations in the Global Coalition To Defeat Islamic State and galvanise their fight against the militant group. However, Trump’s shock Dec. 19 decision to withdraw and the mixed signals Washington has sent about when it may pull out the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria have left U.S. allies and partners rethinking their own commitments. In the latest ambiguous signal, a senior State Department official on Friday first told reporters the United States has no timeline for the withdrawal of troops from Syria and then said it does not plan to stay indefinitely. Another senior State Department official, also briefing reporters before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s trip to the Middle East next week, said one of his main messages would be that “the United States is not leaving the Middle East.” “Despite reports to the contrary and false narratives surrounding the Syria decision, we are not going anywhere.” However, three sources familiar with the matter said that the Trump administration is still working assiduously to contain the fallout from Trump’s troop decision. A Pentagon adviser described the conference as part of a “damage control” effort necessitated by Trump’s abrupt decision and as designed to explain to the coalition members “that nothing has been put in place” with regard to the pullout. “This (Trump’s withdrawal announcement) was a slap-dash, individual decision” that angered and frustrated U.S. military commanders and blind-sided members of the anti-ISIS coalition, said the Pentagon adviser on condition of anonymity. “This is nothing more than damage limitation.” Other people familiar with the administration’s discussions stressed that the meeting had been previously scheduled, but one said it had been given “extra urgency” by the troop decision. A State Department spokeswoman who declined to be identified confirmed the conference was going ahead as scheduled and that “save the date” invitations had gone out but she declined comment on the agenda, saying it was still being worked out. Another source familiar with administration discussions said the meeting had been made more pressing and more difficult by the mixed signals about the withdrawal, possibly making foreign officials reluctant to attend until there is greater clarity. “They are trying to square the circle of what the president said and what they (other U.S. officials) want to do, which is not easy,” said this person, who is familiar with the administration’s discussions on the issue. U.S.-backed forces are still retaking territory from Islamic State in Syria, Pentagon officials said on Friday, two weeks after Trump said the troops had succeeded in their mission and were no longer needed there. Trump has provided a number of different timelines on the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria. On Dec. 19, he said that the forces would be “coming back now.” A few days later, he tweeted that the pullout would be “slow and highly coordinated.” Earlier this week Trump said the withdrawal would be “over a period of time.” While military planners have looked at various timelines, U.S. officials have told Reuters it could take several months to carry out a withdrawal, potentially giving time for U.S.-backed forces to deal parting blows to the militant group that once held broad swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. One of the proposals under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according a person familiar with discussions. Two sources familiar with the discussions predicted it would take at least until the end of 2019 to complete a U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria. “Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t be out in four months,” said the Pentagon adviser on condition of anonymity.

" President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress’ approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmakers emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives. A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall. Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: “Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven’t done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.” The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump’s term. In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump’s request for $5 billion (3.93 billion pounds) to fund the wall. The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House. “We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,” he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency was a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, “I’d never threaten anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.”",0
" A senior U.S. lawmaker asked the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department on Friday how the ongoing partial government shutdown would affect the processing of income tax filings and refunds this year. Representative Richard Neal, a Democrat who is the new chairman of the House of Representatives tax-writing committee, expressed concern that the IRS, the U.S. tax agency, has already furloughed most of its work force and stopped issuing tax refunds since the partial government shutdown began Dec. 22. President Donald Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures $5.6 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. As a result, about 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government. Neal wrote to Charles Rettig, the head of the IRS, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to request information about how the shutdown will affect the IRS’s ability to process tax returns and provide refunds. “I understand that the IRS furloughed nearly 70,000 IRS employees (87.5 percent of the workforce), ceased needed taxpayer services, and stopped issuing tax refunds during the government shutdown,” Neal wrote. “These actions are causing undue hardship to American taxpayers and the IRS civil servants.” An IRS spokesman, Matt Leas, declined to comment on the letter. The average tax refund last year was $2,800 (2,199.53 pounds), money that many families rely on to help pay for rent, food and child care, Neal said in the letter. He also noted that another problem for taxpayers is that as the shutdown continues, mortgage lenders will be unable to obtain tax transcripts to verify income for loan. The U.S. tax filing season normally starts early in the year, ahead of the April 15 deadline for filing income tax returns. Neal asked the IRS when the filing season would launch this year, noting that in 2018 the IRS announced on Jan. 4 that it would start accepting tax returns on Jan. 29.",0
" A U.S. court on Friday ruled in favour of a Trump administration policy barring certain transgender people from serving in the U.S. armed forces, handing the president his first legal victory on the issue after several defeats. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a decision by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that blocked the policy, saying it likely violates the constitutional rights of transgender recruits and service members. President Donald Trump announced in March that he would endorse a plan by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to restrict the military service of transgender people who experience a condition called gender dysphoria. The appeals court victory is limited because other federal courts issued injunctions against the policy, which applied nationwide. The administration already has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue. The high court is due to consider whether to hear three separate government appeals at its private conference on Jan. 11. The various injunctions allowed transgender troops to join the ranks as of Jan. 1, 2018. “Today’s ruling is a devastating slap in the face to transgender service members who have proved their fitness to serve and their dedication to this country,” said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the groups challenging the policy. The three-judge panel said in an unsigned opinion that District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly was wrong to conclude that the new restrictions were essentially the same as the original ban, which she had also blocked. “It was clear error to say there was no significant change,” the judges wrote in the ruling. The new plan, for example, “appears to permit some transgender individuals to serve in the military consistent with established military mental health, physical health, and sex-based standards,” the court said. The American Psychiatric Association defines gender dysphoria as a “clinically significant distress” due to a conflict between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Not all transgender people suffer from gender dysphoria, according to the association, which opposes a military ban. The gender dysphoria restriction replaced an outright ban on transgender service members that Trump announced in July 2017 on Twitter. Trump’s move reversed Democratic former President Barack Obama’s policy of allowing transgender troops to serve openly and receive medical care to transition genders.",0
" A California parole board recommended Thursday that an acolyte of cult leader and mass murderer Charles Manson be set free, media reports said. Manson follower Robert Beausoleil, 71, has served nearly half a century for a conviction in the 1969 slaying of musician Gary Hinman, who was tortured for three days before his death, previous court hearings and news accounts said. Manson, who died in prison in 2017 at age 83, directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war between whites and blacks. Beausoleil was not involved in the so-called Manson Family’s most notorious murders, the slaying of actress Sharon Tate and six others, also in 1969. The actress was the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski. She was stabbed 16 times by cult members. Parole panels have ruled against releasing Beausoleil 18 times before, the Associated Press reported. California’s incoming governor, Gavin Newsom, now has the choice of allowing the convicted killer to go free or blocking the panel’s decision. Out-going Gov. Jerry Brown has previously stopped all recommendations of release for Manson Family members, most recently the proposed release of Leslie Van Houten, 69, last January. Van Houten, at age 19, was the youngest member of the Manson Family and was convicted of taking part in the brutal stabbing deaths of two of the seven homicides attributed to the cult. The state parole board in Sacramento had not yet released transcripts of its latest hearing on its website and no spokesman was immediately available.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday a New York Times report that he was considering former Democratic Senator Jim Webb to be his next defence secretary was “fake news.” The Times, citing an unnamed official, said on Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had reached out to Webb. A senior Pentagon official confirmed Webb’s name had been circulating at the White House, the Times reported. “I’m sure he is a fine man, but I don’t know Jim, and never met him,” Trump said on Twitter. “Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defence, is doing a great job!” he said. Jim Mattis stepped down from his job as defence secretary on Tuesday and Trump said a day later he had essentially fired Mattis, a retired Marine general whose letter of resignation was seen as a sharp rebuke to the Republican president. Mattis resigned after Trump’s surprise decisions to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria and half of the 14,000-strong contingent in Afghanistan. The Times said Republican senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham and former Republican Senator Jim Talent had also been mentioned as possible replacements for Mattis.",0
" Keepers at London Zoo began the arduous task of counting some 600 different species on Thursday, carrying out the park’s week-long annual stocktake. From tigers to monkeys, the zoo keeps records of all animals great and small as a requirement of its license. Last year, it recorded 19,289 animals. “We have a lot of different species and within each species we have a lot of different individuals with different behaviors,” Animal Operations Manager Angela Ryan said. “So being able to make sure that we can see them, that we don’t double count them, can be quite challenging.” New additions this year include penguin chicks, tamanduas and rescued leeches Buffy, Angel and Spike. After the census is completed, the park will share the tally with other zoos around the world in a bid to aid international conservation programs.",0
" Shares in AMS AG (AMS.S) lost a fifth of their value on Thursday after a sales warning from major customer Apple (AAPL.O) brought concerns over the challenges for the Austrian sensor specialist sharply into focus. AMS provides Apple with optical sensors for 3D facial recognition features on its newest smartphones, but analysts have highlighted increasing competitive pressure, a threat from new technologies and overcapacity issues facing the company. Apple warned on Wednesday that sales in its holiday season quarter would be lower than expected, blaming slowing iPhone sales in China. AMS, which had already cut its guidance for the fourth quarter in November, declined to comment on the Apple warning on Thursday. The Swiss-listed group does not identify Apple as its customer, but analysts estimate it accounts for around 45 percent of sales. AMS said in November that customers’ demand pattern had become increasing volatile, making business more difficult to predict. The stock traded at 18.835 Swiss francs (£15.1) at 1400 GMT, down 20 percent. In March last year, investors paid more than 113 Swiss Francs ($114) for the share. The shares lost nearly 75 percent in value last year, while the European sector index .SX8P lost 11 percent and Apple shares 9 percent. Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said they do not expect Apple’s first sales warning in nearly 12 years to trigger a new one from AMS. However, competitors such as Sony (6758.T), Infineon (IFXGn.DE) or STMicro (STM.BN) could threat AMS’s prospects with the development of new high end 3D sensing products. “We see a risk that Apple moves to dual sourcing for the face ID – which currently is single sourced from AMS - in order not to rely on deliveries from just one supplier and also in order to have a favourable pricing power,” said Hauck & Aufhaeuser analysts in a note to clients. Industry experts also see overcapacity as an issue at AMS. The Austrian group has invested heavily in its manufacturing capacities in Singapore in recent years, but the utilisation rate has remained below expectations.",0

" Two U.S. lawmakers who have been active in congressional efforts to address technology threats from China introduced a bill on Friday to create a White House office to fight state-sponsored technology theft and defend critical supply chains. Senators Mark Warner, a Democrat and a vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Marco Rubio, a Republican on the panel, introduced the legislation. The bill aims to create the Office of Critical Technologies and Security to coordinate an inter-agency strategy to fight high-tech threats to national security posed by China and other foreign actors, they said in a press statement. “We need a whole-of-government technology strategy to protect U.S. competitiveness in emerging and dual-use technologies and address the Chinese threat by combating technology transfer from the United States,” said Warner in a statement. “We look forward to working with the Executive Branch and others to coordinate and respond to this threat.” Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger intends to introduce a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives early next week, according to a spokeswoman for his office. The bill was introduced in the midst of a battle between Washington and Beijing as President Donald Trump’s administration has accused China of seeking to steal U.S. technology and other misconduct. The two nations have been locked in a trade war for much of the past year, disrupting the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars in goods and raising concern of slowing growth. Talks are set for Beijing next week. Separately, national security experts as well as lawmakers such as Warner and Rubio have been concerned about the use of Chinese-made telecommunications equipment in U.S. networks, and are attempting to exclude companies like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp from U.S. networks. The White House office created by the bill would seek to ensure that critical U.S. supply chains, both government and non-governmental, are not jeopardized by reliance on foreign manufacturers, the two lawmakers said in the statement.",0
" Britain cautioned Russia on Friday that individuals should not be used as diplomatic pawns after a former U.S. Marine who also holds a British passport was detained in Moscow on espionage charges. Paul Whelan was arrested by Russia’s Federal Security Service on Dec. 28. His family have said he is innocent and that he was in Moscow to attend a wedding. “Individuals should not be used as pawns of diplomatic leverage,” British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said. “We are extremely worried about Paul Whelan. We have offered consular assistance,” Hunt said. “The U.S. are leading on this because he is a British and American citizen.” Official sources familiar with U.S. and British intelligence told Reuters on Friday that they were unaware of any possible connections between Whelan and any U.S. or British agency. One of the sources said experts at intelligence agencies believe Whelan would have been far more careful if he was a spy, working under official cover as a U.S. diplomat or “non-official cover” posing as a civilian. Since leaving the U.S. military, Whelan had worked as a global security executive with U.S. companies, had visited Russia and developed a network of Russian acquaintances. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week Washington had asked Moscow to explain Whelan’s arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determined his detention is inappropriate. The FSB has opened a criminal case against Whelan but given no details of his alleged activities. In Russia, an espionage conviction carries a prison sentence of 10 to 20 years. Whelan’s detention further complicates a strained relationship between Moscow and Washington, despite the professed desire of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to build a personal rapport. U.S. intelligence officials accuse Russia of meddling in U.S. elections - a charge Russia denies. Putin has previously stated he would rein in Russian retaliatory measures against U.S. interests in the hope relations would improve, but Whelan’s detention indicates the Kremlin’s calculations may now have changed. A Russian national, Maria Butina, admitted last month to U.S. prosecutors that she had tried to infiltrate American conservative groups as an agent for Moscow. David Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it was “possible, even likely,” that Russia had detained Whelan to set up an exchange for Butina. Dmitry Novikov, a first deputy head of the international affairs committee in Russia’s lower house of parliament, commenting on a possible swap, said Russian intelligence first needed to finish their investigations. “Then we’ll see,” Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. Whelan’s British citizenship introduces a new political dimension. Relations between London and Moscow have been toxic since the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in March last year. Britain alleges Skripal was poisoned by Russian intelligence agents posing as tourists, while Russia denies any involvement. RTE, Ireland’s national broadcaster, reported that Whelan also holds an Irish passport, and that the country’s Department of Foreign Affairs said the Irish embassy in Moscow had requested consular access to one of its citizens detained in Russia who had requested assistance. Paul Whelan is 48 and lives in Novi, Michigan, according to public records. He is director of global security at BorgWarner, a U.S. auto parts maker based in Michigan. The company said Whelan was “responsible for overseeing security at our facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and at other company locations around the world”. Its website lists no facilities in Russia. U.S. media said he had previously worked in security and investigations for the global staffing firm Kelly Services, which is headquartered in Michigan and has operations in Russia. “We are relieved and very pleased to know that staff of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have been given consular access to Paul and confirmed that he is safe,” his brother, David Whelan, said in an emailed statement on Friday. “Our focus remains on ensuring that Paul is safe, well treated, has a good lawyer, and is coming home.” Whelan’s military record, provided by the Pentagon, showed that he served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 14 years. The highest rank he attained was staff sergeant. He was discharged in 2008 after being convicted on charges related to larceny, according to his records. Additional records provided by the Pentagon said Whelan had attempted to steal about $10,410 while in Iraq in 2006. Whelan has for years maintained an account in VKontakte, a Russian social media network, which showed he had a circle of Russian acquaintances. Out of the more than 50 people tagged as Whelan’s friends on VKontakte, a significant number were software engineers or worked in the IT sector, and a significant proportion had ties to the fields of defence and security. One of these people served in the Russian navy’s Black Sea fleet, a photo of that person posted on his own account indicated. A second friend had on his VKontakte page photos of people in the uniform of Russian paratroop forces. Whelan used the account to send out congratulations on Russian public holidays. In 2015, he posted the words in Russian: “In Moscow ...” and accompanied it with a Russian mobile phone number. The number was not answering this week. According to his brother David, Whelan was in Moscow to attend the wedding of a fellow retired Marine. When he was detained he was staying with the rest of the wedding party at Moscow’s upmarket Metropol hotel, the brother said. He did not specify the wedding location. An employee at the hotel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Friday they could not access its database to check, but could not recall any weddings scheduled there in the second half of December.

" Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday called for minimum retirement ages significantly lower than those proposed by his predecessor, sparking concerns among investors that he will back watered-down pension reform legislation. Bolsonaro also said regional security was the basis for his statement on Thursday that he might be willing to allow a U.S. military base on Brazilian soil as a way to counter Russian influence in Venezuela. The newly inaugurated leader, speaking at an Air Force swearing-in ceremony on Friday, further said he is concerned that the latest proposal for the sale of 80 percent of Embraer’s commercial aviation business to Boeing Co could ultimately lead to the U.S. planemaker owning all of the new venture. It was the strongest expression of concern so far by his government over the tie-up. Embraer shares were down more than 5 percent in late afternoon trading. On pension reform, Bolsonaro told reporters at an Air Force event that the minimum retirement age would be 62 for men and 57 for women, effective five years after any legislation is passed. That is lower than the minimums of 65 years of age for men and 62 for women that were proposed by ex-president Michel Temer. Later on Friday, Bolsonaro’s Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni appeared to walk back what Bolsonaro said on minimum age requirement, saying it was one option and that no final decision had been made by the president’s economic team. A reform of Brazil’s bloated pension system will be among Bolsonaro’s biggest challenges, since he has yet to build a base in Congress. It is key to erasing the country’s 130 billion reais (27.5 billion pounds) public deficit for 2019. Investors on Friday sent interest rates higher on futures markets, showing disappointment about the lower-than-expected minimum age. The head of one major foreign bank’s treasury desk saying that “it was not expected by the market and its unambitious, to say the least.” Bolsonaro told reporters his government would have to raise the IOF tax on financial transactions to compensate for tax breaks extended to Brazil’s poor north and northeast. But tax revenue secretary Marcos Cintra later said that would not be necessary, after meeting with the president. Since his inauguration on Tuesday, Bolsonaro has used executive orders to open up Brazil’s economy, crack down on violent drug gangs and redraw the country’s foreign policy while pushing conservative social measures. Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former Army captain and admirer of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship and U.S. President Donald Trump, has quickly deepened ties with the Unites States and Israel, with plans to move the Brazilian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In a television interview on Thursday night, Bolsonaro said he would be open to the possibility of the United States operating a military base in Brazil, a sharp shift in a foreign policy that has traditionally stressed neutrality. He said he is worried about Russia’s closeness with Venezuelan leftist President Nicolas Maduro, whom he has repeatedly called a dictator. A visit to Venezuela by two Russian nuclear-capable strategic bombers in December infuriated the U.S. government and alarmed Brazil’s military. “I have discussed this internally and with interest in other countries in South America,” Bolsonaro told reporters on Friday when asked about hosting a U.S. base. “We have to worry about our security and our sovereignty,” he said, adding: “I consider the American people our friends.” On Friday, Justice Minister Sergio Moro ordered elite federal police to the northeastern state of Ceará, where suspected drug gang members have carried out dozens of attacks against banks and police barracks, and torched several buses. No deaths of bystanders have been reported. Gangs across Brazil typically carry out such actions to spread fear and in response to police crackdowns on the streets or in prisons. Ceará state officials in recent days have said they would start sending prisoners to whatever jails had space, and not separate those incarcerated according to gang affiliation. Critics blasted the proposal, saying that it will result in immediate and bloody prison uprisings. Earlier Friday, Bolsonaro stressed his desire for the quick passage of a bill to protect security officials and measures to open up competition in the banking sector. The far-right president, elected on a law-and-order platform, warned in a tweet that sky-high violence would only slow if laws were passed to provide police and soldiers freedom from prosecution when on active duty. “The legislative, executive and judicial powers have to make this commitment urgently,” he tweeted. Throughout the campaign, Bolsonaro said he wanted to give police and soldiers peace of mind while on often-violent operations, and he has also advocated broader access to guns so people can defend themselves. Critics argue those ideas only risk inflaming Brazil’s violent streets and worsening Brazil’s murder tally, nearly 64,000 people in 2017, a record.",0
" Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s chief of staff said on Friday that there would be no hike in a financial transaction tax, contradicting what the leader himself said earlier in the day. The chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, said that after Bolsonaro spoke with the head of Brazil’s tax collection agency, it was understood that there would be no need to increase the tax. Lorenzoni also said it was not set in stone that the Bolsonaro team’s pension reform package would have minimum retirement ages of 57 for women and 62 for men, as the president said earlier on Friday.",0
" A U.S. strike targeted a militant in Yemen believed to be one of the planners of a deadly bombing of the Navy destroyer USS Cole in 2000, but the results of the strike were still being assessed, the U.S. military said on Friday. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that the strike on Jan. 1 in the Marib governorate of Yemen had targeted Jamal al-Badawi, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2003 and was wanted for his role in the USS Cole attack. He escaped from prison in Yemen twice, once in 2003 and again in 2006. There is a $5 million (3.93 million pounds) reward for information leading to his arrest. On Oct. 12, 2000, two men in a small boat detonated explosives alongside the Navy guided missile destroyer as it was refuelling in Aden, killing 17 sailors, wounding more than three dozen others and blasting a gaping hole in its hull.",0
" Personal data and documents from hundreds of German politicians and public figures including Chancellor Angela Merkel have been published online in what appears to be one of Germany’s most far-reaching data breaches. A preliminary analysis showed the data had been obtained through “wrongful use of log-in information for cloud services, email accounts or social networks”, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in a statement late on Friday. He said there was no evidence that the computer systems of the German lower house of parliament or the government had been compromised, but provided no further details. The ministry said it remained unclear if the breach, which triggered an emergency meeting of the BSI national cyber defense agency, was the result of a hack or a leak. Authorities were investigating all possibilities, including espionage, according to one government source, who said it was unlikely that any single person could have compiled the massive amounts of data that had been released. The public broadcaster rbb, which broke the story, said the data, published on a Twitter account, included addresses, personal letters and copies of identity cards. It said the identity of the perpetrators and their motive were not known. The twitter account, which existed for four years and has now been deleted, first began releasing data in December in an electronic “Advent calendar”. The extent of the data leaks first became apparent late on Thursday evening, sources said. German media said a fax number and two email addresses used by Merkel had been published but the government said it appeared no sensitive material from her office had been released. The hacked material included private chats by Greens leader Robert Habeck with family members and the identity cards of his children, a source familiar with the matter said. Die Welt newspaper reported late Friday that published lists included names of 410 members of Merkel’s conservatives, 230 Social Democrats, 106 Greens party members, 91 members of the radical Left party and 28 Free Democrats. The BSI said all but one of the seven parties in the lower house had been affected. German media said that party was the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). Last year, lawmakers said a powerful cyber attack had breached the foreign ministry’s computer network. Security officials have blamed most previous breaches of data security on a Russian hacking group, while the Kremlin has consistently denied involvement in such incidents. The BSI met to coordinate the response of intelligence and other federal agencies. The Defense Ministry said the armed forces were not affected. The public broadcaster ARD - affiliated to rbb - said its journalists had as yet detected no incriminating content. The city-state of Hamburg was working with Irish data protection authorities to stop the data being spread via Twitter, but said the company had not been responsive. It said the Twitter account used to spread the data had been deleted, but that it was still pressing for the deletion of links to data on other platforms. Security officials have blamed most previous attacks on a Russian hacking group, APT28, that experts say has close ties to a Russian spy agency.

" Medical tests have shown a patient treated in isolation at Sweden’s Uppsala University Hospital for suspected Ebola is not infected with the virus after all, authorities said on Friday. The patient, whose identity was not disclosed, was isolated and transferred to the hospital north of Stockholm after originally being admitted to the emergency ward of the smaller Enkoping hospital. The young man had been in Burundi for around three weeks, and was exhibiting classic symptoms of haemorrhagic fever, including vomiting blood, the hospital’s chief medical officer said earlier on Friday. The regional authority said the man’s condition had improved over the course of the day and that while tests had also ruled out diseases such as Marburg and dengue fever, further examinations were needed to determine the nature of the illness. Patients at the emergency ward in Enkoping had also been kept isolated pending the test results, as were the man’s relatives, but all were now free to go home, it said. There is no known Ebola outbreak in Burundi, but it borders the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been fighting an outbreak for almost six months. The disease has killed 356 of the 585 people known to have been infected. The epidemic in a volatile part of Congo is the second worst ever, according to the World Health Organization. The largest outbreak was one in 2013-2016 in West Africa, where more than 28,000 cases were confirmed.

" Thirty-nine bodies have been pulled from under the rubble of a Russian apartment building that partially collapsed this week after an apparent gas explosion, Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. The blast in the early hours of December 31 damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. The death toll has progressively risen in the past few days as rescuers battle blisteringly cold temperatures to recover people trapped under the rubble. The emergencies ministry said earlier on Thursday that 37 people had been killed. But the death toll went up to 39 when rescuers recovered another two bodies from the rubble on Thursday afternoon. Deputy Emergencies Minister Alexander Chupriyan told Interfax there were no more bodies under the rubble and that the search and rescue operation was over. A Reuters witness at the scene said that workers were removing debris from the site using cranes and other equipment. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, has said it is still investigating the exact cause of the blast. It said no traces of explosives had been found at the site. Initial reports attributed the blast to a gas explosion. Gas explosions are relatively common in Russia because of ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas use.",0
" The Treasury named Colette Bowe, a former senior civil servant and regulator, and Jayne-Anne Gadhia, until recently the head of a start-up bank, to serve on the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee. Bowe, currently chair of the Banking Standards Board (BSB) industry group, will replace Richard Sharp on the FPC, which monitors risks in Britain’s financial system, from the end of March. Gadhia, who was chief executive of lender Virgin Money for more than 10 years until it was taken over by CYBG (CYBGC.L), will replace Martin Taylor at the end of June. “As chair of the Banking Standards Board, Colette has led the way in developing and embedding better standards of conduct across the banking sector,” BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a statement on Thursday. “Jayne-Anne brings deep and relevant experience in retail banking and her successful business career.” Since the 1990s Bowe has had several jobs at the top of consumer regulation, notably heading the Personal Investment Authority and Britain’s telecoms watchdog, Ofcom. As a senior civil servant in the 1980s, Bowe was drawn into a political scandal as former prime minister Margaret Thatcher and her ministers secretly competed to swing the sale of British helicopter maker Westland to either U.S. or European suitors. Under orders from the trade and industry minister Leon Brittan and with Thatcher’s blessing, Bowe leaked a confidential legal memo to undermine defence minister Michael Heseltine’s bid to secure a European buyer for Westland. Bowe kept silent about who ordered the leak for nearly 30 years, citing the principle of confidentiality between ministers and civil servants. She once said she had “nothing but contempt for people who blab”. As chair of the BSB, which was set up in a bid to improve conduct standards at banks after a string of scandals, she told MPs last year that bankers were still too afraid to admit mistakes to colleagues. MPs have previously criticised the finance ministry for appointing too few women to the Bank’s three main monetary, financial and regulation policy committees. Bowe and Gadhia will bring the total number of female policymakers at the Bank to six, compared with 16 men. The finance ministry said it interviewed five women and three men for the posts. Gadhia has long been an advocate for greater representation of women in senior roles in Britain’s financial services, where the four big banks all have male chief executives and chairmen. Gadhia and Bowe will at some point appear before MPs from parliament’s Treasury Committee.",0
" Five Louisiana children travelling to Disney World in a church van were among the seven people who died in a fiery crash involving two tractor trailers travelling in opposite directions in Florida, law enforcement and church officials said on Friday. The children, who ranged in age from 8 or 9 to teenagers, were killed on Thursday afternoon in the crash that began when a northbound tractor-trailer and car collided on I-75 near Gainesville, Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lieutenant Patrick Riordan said. The two northbound vehicles crossed into the southbound lanes and collided with another tractor-trailer and the church van, leaving a mass of flaming wreckage, Riordan told a press briefing near the scene. The unidentified drivers of the two trucks, both men, also died in the crash, he said. Another six to eight people were taken to area hospitals with various injuries, he added. The church van, owned by Avoyelles House of Mercy in Marksville, Louisiana, was taking nine children and three women to Orlando, home of Disney World, according to Kevin Cox, Louisiana district superintendent of the United Pentecostal Church. One of the women was pregnant and delivered her baby after the crash, Cox said in a statement on the Louisiana district’s Facebook page. The baby and the surviving four other children and three adults are expected to recover, he said. The new mother also survived. Some of the van’s occupants, including children, were ejected from the vehicle onto the roadway and may have been struck by a fifth vehicle immediately after the crash, Riordan said. The number of passengers in the van was unknown and Riordan said the investigation was still underway. Alachua County Fire Rescue posted a photograph on Facebook showing flames engulfing a truck with a vehicle underneath it. About 50 gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the crash, it said. The interstate highway was closed in both directions for several hours, according to Florida media reports.

" Dutch authorities will hold Swiss shipping line MSC liable for the cost of cleaning up debris from more than 270 cargo containers that fell off one of its vessels and washed up on shore, officials said on Friday. The Dutch coastguard said a criminal investigation had been launched by prosecutors into the incident, one of the largest of its kind off the coast of the Netherlands. The containers, some holding hazardous chemicals, fell off one of the world’s largest container ships, the MSC Zoe, during a North Sea storm on Wednesday in German waters near the island of Borkum. Roughly 35 containers have been located and the remainder were lost at sea, Water Management Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen wrote in a letter to parliament. “Those responsible (MSC) will be held liable,” she wrote. Among the lost goods were car parts, refrigerators, toys and furniture, she wrote. “Several containers of hazardous materials were onboard. It is unclear how many fell off,” it said. At least one container load of organic peroxide, a strong bleaching agent that can cause injury on contact with skin, was lost, the letter said. Residents were told not to touch 25-kg bags found on the shore. Germany is pushing for the adoption of global rules mandating transmitters on shipping containers, especially for dangerous goods, Norbert Brackmann, Germany’s maritime business coordinator, told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper. But he added that it could take several years before the 170 members of the International Maritime Organisation agree on such a step. Prosecutors said in a statement sent to Reuters that a joint investigation with Maritime Police would focus on “whether the damage caused is the result of criminal acts,” possibly in violation of the anti-pollution laws for seagoing vessels. “It will consider whether we can hold someone - and if so who - responsible for the pollution,” it said. Tineke Schokker, the mayor of Vlieland, one of the Wadden Islands, said she and four other mayors sent letters to MSC demanding that costs be covered. Debris continued to wash up on Friday, she said, posing a threat to flora and fauna. “They need to remove this as quickly as possible because the longer it’s here the more damage it does,” she said told Reuters. “We have decided to collectively pass on the costs to the shipping company.” It was not clear if there would be lasting environmental damage to the area, a vast expanse of tidal flats and wetlands known for its rich biological diversity. Roughly 100 soldiers have joined the clean-up operation. Local authorities and volunteers have already gathered up tonnes of waste from several kilometres (miles) of coastline. A statement from MSC on Friday said it was “directly taking over more of the clean-up” and working with salvage companies. An MSC spokesman had no immediate comment about the letters sent by island mayors, but the statement said it had deployed boats to locate and tow drifting containers, plus sonar-tracing vessels for underwater recovery. “MSC is not giving a detailed account of the cargo on board to the general public at this time,” it said, adding that “caution should be applied in particular for any containers or drums which are labelled as having hazardous content”.

" The Iranian navy will send warships to deploy in the Atlantic from March, a top commander said on Friday, as the Islamic Republic seeks to increase the operating range of its naval forces to the backyard of the United States, its arch foe. Iran sees the presence of U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf as a security concern and its navy has sought to counter that by showing the flag near American waters. A flotilla will leave for the Atlantic early in the Iranian new year, starting from March, Iran’s naval deputy commander said. “The Atlantic Ocean is far and the operation of the Iranian naval flotilla might take five months,” Rear-Admiral Touraj Hassani was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. He said Sahand, a newly-built destroyer, would be one of the warships. Sahand has a flight deck for helicopters and Iran says it is equipped with anti-aircraft and anti-ship guns, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles and has electronic warfare capabilities. Hassani said in December that Iran would soon send two to three vessels on a mission to Venezuela. A senior Iranian military official said last month that the navy could sail in the Atlantic near U.S. waters since U.S. aircraft carriers were allowed to move around in international waters near Iran. Iran’s navy has extended its reach in recent years, launching vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden to protect Iranian ships from Somali pirates. “By their continuous presence in international waters, Iranian naval forces aim to implement the orders of commander-in-chief of the armed forces (Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei), wave the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran, thwart the Iranophobia plots, and secure shipping routes,” Hassani said. A U.S.-Iranian war of words has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump took Washington out of a world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran in May, and reimposed sanctions on its banking and energy sectors. Iran has warned that if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressures, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf. A third of the world’s sea-borne oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz. In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between the Revolutionary Guards and U.S. military in the Gulf, but the number of incidents has dropped in recent months.",0

" Dozens of protesters chanted anti-government slogans as they left Friday prayers at a major mosque near Sudan’s capital, a day after a prominent figure in President Omar al-Bashir’s party called for him to resign. Security forces fired teargas to break up the crowd in Omdurman, as demonstrations against price rises, cash shortages and other economic hardships stretched into their third week. A group of unions that has organised the protests said one of its leaders, Mohammad Naji al-Assam, was arrested at noon, without giving more details. “The association condemns arbitrary detentions, which will not stop it from continuing the march with the people for the sake of freedom and change,” the Sudanese Association of Professionals said on Twitter. The protests are the most persistent opposition Bashir has faced since he took power in an Islamist-backed coup nearly 30 years ago. Bashir and the head of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service have called for restraint in the response to the protests, which government officials have blamed on unnamed infiltrators. Friday’s protesters, mainly young men, chanted “peaceful, peaceful” and “fall, fall,” as they called for a change in government outside Al-Sayed Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi mosque, which has ties to the opposition Umma party. Their march was much smaller than ones that have broken out in cities across Sudan since Dec. 19. Organisers have urged people to march again towards the presidential palace in Khartoum on Sunday. Al-Shafi’ Ahmad Mohammad, the first secretary-general of Bashir’s National Congress Party, issued a rare call on Thursday for Bashir to step down. In a voice recording circulating on WhatsApp, he identified himself and said that Bashir should resign and form a transitional government “to save the country”. There was no reaction to his message from the government and he did not immediately respond to a call to ask for further comment. Mohammad’s call came after opposition parties said on Tuesday they wanted Bashir to dissolve the government and form a transitional administration that would set a date for elections. Their petition also called for the investigation of alleged abuses by security forces during recent demonstrations across Sudan. Authorities have said 19 people, including two security officials, have died during the demonstrations. Amnesty International said last week it had credible reports that 37 protesters had been killed by bullets fired by security forces. Barraq al-Nathir al-Warraq, a human rights activist in Sudan, said Sudanese security forces have detained around 2,000 people since the beginning of the protests. Those detained include political activists, journalists and civil society members. Sudan’s economy has struggled to recover from the loss of three quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - since South Sudan seceded in 2011, keeping most of the oilfields. The United States lifted 20-year-old trade sanctions on Sudan in October 2017. But many investors have continued to shun a country still listed by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism, whose president is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges of masterminding genocide in Darfur - charges he dismisses.

" A group of U.S. activists opposed to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies helped migrants in Mexico during a clash with U.S. agents at the border on New Year’s Eve, and dispute their government’s account of the events. Late on Monday, about 150 migrants gathered at the border in Tijuana to try to enter the United States, according to the U.S. activists and a Reuters witness. After learning of a possible conflict, 11 U.S. volunteers who were in Tijuana headed to the border to provide medical assistance and document the events, said Lilith Sinclair, a spokeswoman for the group. The activists, some of whom are part of a group known as the Border Support Network, have said they were banding together to counter what they view as the U.S. government’s violation of asylum seekers’ rights. They have also challenged the U.S. government’s position that agents deployed tear gas after coming under attack. “This attack on migrants peacefully seeking asylum was crippling, inhumane and unprovoked,” Sinclair said in a statement on Wednesday. The clash in Tijuana was the second incident in less than two months in which dozens of migrants tried to cross the border and were met with gas. The activists were not present for the entire confrontation, but did not witness any provocation by migrants in the time they were there, Sinclair, a 24-year-old from Portland, Oregon, said in an interview. When Sinclair arrived, she saw a small group near the border fence, trying to tell agents they planned to seek asylum. She then saw agents deploy tear gas. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency said it could not immediately respond to a request for comment, citing a backlog due to the U.S. government shutdown. The CBP previously said agents launched smoke, pepper spray and tear gas known as CS gas only after migrants threw rocks. “This is among the lowest levels of response we can give,” said Joshua Wilson, vice president of the San Diego Border Patrol Union. “A rock is deadly force.” A Reuters witness did not see migrants throwing rocks. The Associated Press reported that rocks were flung after tear gas was deployed. The CBP said on Wednesday that an internal investigation of the use of CS gas on Dec. 31 was underway. On Thursday, the Mexican government requested a full investigation. ANTI-FASCISTS Formed in November in response to the migrant caravans that drew Trump’s ire, the activist coalition includes self-described anti-fascists and advocates for causes such as indigenous rights and water access, Sinclair said. Some members met through protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline and a police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. Mario Osuna, Tijuana’s secretary of municipal development, and a spokesman for the foreign ministry said they had no information about the group. Mexico’s immigration institute did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under Mexican law, U.S. citizens may undertake voluntary work for up to 180 days without a visa. In mid-November, the group opened a safe house in Tijuana, housing about 25 volunteers at a time, most from the United States, said Evan Duke of Seattle, one of the organizers. The Border Support Network is funded largely by individual donations, Sinclair said. The group mobilized quickly after receiving word of the clash, heading out with warm clothes, medical supplies and water, said Duke, 45. He stayed behind to support volunteers from the safe house, adding that the activists had not transported migrants to the border or otherwise instigated the incident. An independent volunteer, Nathaniel Dennison, a 34-year-old documentary filmmaker based in Virginia, said the mood at the border was “hopeful and peaceful until border patrol acted on asylum seekers, unprovoked.” Dennison said he was struck by three “plastic pellets.” The CBP says it does not deploy rubber bullets but does use pepper balls, a round rubber projectile containing pepper spray. Erick Hernandez, a 24-year-old Salvadoran who tried to enter the United States, said American volunteers helped bridge the language gap at the border. “They spoke with the American side,” he said. “We asked them for a little bit of respect for the children.”",0
" Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will remain in place for “a while” thanks to support from Russia, even though Britain’s position was still that he remains a block to lasting peace. “The British long-standing position is that we won’t have lasting peace in Syria with that (Assad-led) regime, but regretfully, we do think he’s going to be around for a while,” Hunt told Sky News. Nearly eight years into a war that has displaced millions of Syrians, Assad has recovered control of most of the country with support from Russia, Iran, and Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim groups such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Last week, the United Arab Emirates reopened its embassy in Damascus, marking a diplomatic boost for Assad from a U.S.-allied Arab state that once backed rebels fighting him.",0
" The European Commission said on Thursday it had cleared the sale of the Costa Coffee chain to U.S. drinks maker Coca-Cola Co from British restaurant and hotel owner Whitbread Plc. “The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns because the companies do not sell the same products and the links between their activities are limited,” the EU executive said in a statement.",0
" British retailers are giving updates on Christmas trading, by far their busiest and most important period of the year, stretching from “Black Friday” on Nov. 23 to early January clearance sales. Investors had been braced for bad news after a major profit warning from the one-time online darling ASOS last month capped a torrid year for the sector marred by shop closures and bankruptcies. On the high street the run up to Christmas was marked by discounting while the number of shoppers hitting the shops after December 25 fell on previous years. Following are the highlights: Reported on Jan. 3. Next A late surge in online demand helped British clothing retailer Next to increase sales in the Christmas period, confounding fears of tough festive trading and lifting shares across the battered sector. Reported on Jan. 2. John Lewis [JLPLC.UL] said sales in its department stores rose 4.5 percent in the week ending December 29, boosted by strong demand on Christmas Eve and “a confident start to post-Christmas clearance both online and in shops”. Reported on Dec. 29. Music retailer HMV called in the administrators for the second time in five years after it said demand for CDs and DVDs was disappearing. One of the best known names on the high street, it plans to keep the business running while it tries to find a buyer.",0
" The United States does not believe the Saudi version of the October killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has “hit that threshold of credibility,” a senior State Department official said on Friday even as Saudi Arabia prosecutes suspects. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will emphasise the need for accountability and credibility in the investigation of Khashoggi’s death during a visit next week to the Middle East, including to Riyadh, the official said. “The Secretary has been very consistent in engagements with Saudis ...to really push the two points of accountability and credibility, which is that the Saudis should have a credible narrative for what happened,” said the official, who briefed reporters on Pompeo’s trip. “I don’t think from our point of view that the narrative emerging from the Saudis or the legal process has yet hit that threshold of credibility and accountability,” the official said. Pompeo wants both the perpetrators and the planners of the killing to be identified by the Saudis and appropriate punishments are meted out, the official added. Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Washington Post journalist from Saudi Arabia who had become a critic of the kingdom’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. U.S. intelligence agencies believe the crown prince ordered an operation to kill Khashoggi, whose body was dismembered and removed from the building to a location still publicly unknown. Top Turkish officials have also tied his death to the highest levels of Saudi leadership. Saudi officials have denied accusations that the prince ordered the murder. President Donald Trump, who has cultivated a close relationship with the crown prince, told Reuters last month he stood by the crown prince despite the CIA assessment and pleas from U.S. senators for Trump to condemn the kingdom’s de facto ruler. A Saudi court on Thursday held its first hearing on Khashoggi’s case in which Saudi Arabian prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 suspects in the case. The United Nations human rights office on Friday called the trial “not sufficient.” The State Department official said the United States was not “looking to get into the weeds” of the court case but would emphasise the need for a credible legal process. Pompeo will also visit Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait as part of his Jan. 8 to Jan. 15 trip, the State Department said in a statement. As part of his talks with Middle Eastern leaders, Pompeo will also discuss the war in Yemen as well as Iran, Syria and other regional issues, the department said.

" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will appoint a new envoy to Somalia, a U.N. spokesman said on Friday, after failing to convince the country to retract its decision to expel the current representative over accusations of interference. Since Somalia’s foreign ministry declared late on Tuesday that U.N. envoy Nicholas Haysom “cannot work in this country,” Guterres has spoken twice with Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York. “The Secretary-General deeply regrets the decision of the Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” Haq said. “The Secretary-General has full confidence in Mr. Haysom.” Haq noted that the doctrine of persona non grata does not apply to United Nations personnel. “At the same time the Secretary-General is totally committed to ensuring that the needs of the Somali people are at the forefront of the work of the United Nations in Somalia,” Haq said. “Therefore, he intends to appoint in due course a new Special Representative for Somalia.” The U.N. Security Council is due to discuss the developments behind closed doors later on Friday, diplomats said. The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that has lacked strong central government since 1991. The government’s decision on Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semiautonomous regions. Haysom had raised questions in a letter on Sunday about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security forces in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who was blocked from running in a regional election. Haysom, a South African, told the Security Council on Thursday that the allegations of interference by the federal government in the regional election and the violence that followed the former militant’s arrest “does not bode well for the upcoming electoral processes in other regions or for the 2020 national elections.” Somalia’s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman told the Security Council that the Somali people wanted “Somalia leading international support, not international support leading Somalia.” “Somalia distinguishes between the institutions that we are part of and individual conduct that’s had detrimental effect on our fragile nation,” he said.",0
" France will tighten security at its northern ports and increase surveillance along beaches to counter the rise in migrants trying to cross the English Channel to reach Britain, its interior minister said on Friday. More than 500 migrants, most Iranian, tried to cross the narrow stretch of water, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, during 2018, French Interior Ministry data showed. Some 276 migrants reached British waters while the French authorities thwarted the attempts of another 228. More than 80 percent of the crossings were attempted in December. “This action plan must enable us to put an end to these crossings of the Channel which are not only illegal but also dangerous,” Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said in a statement. “It is in our interests, as well as British interests, to do everything possible to prevent the development of new trafficking routes that might attract illegal migrants to our coast once again.” In late October 2016, France razed a sprawling migrant camp outside the northern port of Calais that served as a launch pad for migrants seeking to enter Britain hidden in trucks, trains and ferries. The numbers trying to reach Britain increased sharply last year compared with 2017 but remained a tiny fraction of those regularly attempting to reach European Union territory by crossing the Mediterranean from northern Africa and Turkey. Nonetheless, the Channel crossings have put pressure on the British government amid a charged political atmosphere less than three months before Britain is due to leave the EU after a referendum in which immigration was a major theme. British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said HMS Mersey, a Royal Navy offshore patrol vessel, was deploying to the Dover-Calais straits to stem the flow of migrants. The waterway is just 21 miles (33.8 km) wide at its narrowest point.",0
" An attempt to embarrass newly elected U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a nine-year-old video showing her dancing while in college backfired when it drew a wave of support for the liberal lawmaker on social media. The widely-shared video shows the 29-year-old Democrat, the youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. Congress, dancing on a roof with other students at Boston University as they recreate dance scenes from famous 1980’s films like “The Breakfast Club.” The caption under the original Twitter post, which was reported to have been uploaded by the now-deactivated account @AnonymousQ1776, read: “Here is America’s favourite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is....”. Ocasio-Cortez graduated from the university in 2011 with degrees in international relations and economics. The New York lawmaker, who rose to prominence last year after beating a 10-term incumbent in a Democratic primary, posted on Twitter on Friday a brief video of herself dancing outside of her office with a huge grin while the song “War” by Edwin Starr is heard playing in the background. “I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous,” wrote Ocasio-Cortez in the tweet. “Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! Have a great weekend everyone.” Ocasio-Cortez was part of a wave of Democratic women congressional candidates elected in November aiming to put more support behind the liberal progressive wing of the party. Twitter comments broke along partisan lines, with opponents describing the dance video as showing immaturity while supporters saw it as cute. “Hey @AOC, just wanted to say that I thought the high school video of you dancing was awesome,” wrote Twitter user David Weissman, a New York-born columnist now living in Israel on Thursday, referring to Ocasio-Cortez by her Twitter handle. “It also shows your haters are desperate and pathetic, keep being you.” The original posting meant to demean Ocasio-Cortez incorrectly said she was in high school at the time the video was recorded. “The video of @AOC dancing is so well done. And she’s all joy in it. I can’t believe they thought that was going to be some scandal,” wrote DeRay McKesson, a U.S. civil rights activist who was a leader of the Black Lives Matter wave of protests against police violence that swept U.S. cities including Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015.",0
" German police have detained three men suspected of involvement in an explosion that targeted an office of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party in the eastern state of Saxony. No one was injured in the explosion outside the AfD office in the city of Doebeln late on Thursday. The blast set the office on fire and damaged vehicles and nearby buildings, Saxony’s LKA criminal investigation office said in a statement. The LKA said its anti-terrorism unit had determined that the explosion was an escalation in politically motivated attacks targeting AfD offices in Saxony that are usually limited to acts of vandalism. “The attack against the AfD office in Doebeln is special given that the explosion was intended to harm people,” the LKA said. Saxony was the site of far-right riots and demonstrations sparked by the stabbing to death of a Cuban-German man in the city of Chemnitz in August, initially blamed on two migrants from Iraq and Syria. The riots, which featured skinheads performing the Hitler salute and chasing migrants in the streets of Chemnitz, highlighted the depth of a rift created by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to welcome almost one million asylum seekers, mainly Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Saxony has a large far-right scene. But it is also home to many supporters of the hard-left Die Linke, which is the second-largest party in the regional assembly. Police said the three men it detained were aged 29, 32 and 50. The LKA’s anti-terrorism unit is still investigating the incident.",0
" The German city-state of Hamburg on Friday said it was working with Irish data protection authorities to stop the spread of German politicians’ data via the social media platform Twitter (TWTR.N). The city’s data protection agency said the Twitter account used to spread personal data has been deleted, but it has not received an answer from Twitter about its demand to delete a list of short links to other platforms where the data resides. It said the scope of the published personal data was enormous, and the potential consequences for affected individuals could be significant.",0
" The United Nations on Friday called for an independent and impartial investigation into the Dec. 30 election in Bangladesh in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won a third straight term amid accusations of violence and voting irregularities. Hasina’s ruling alliance won more than 90 percent of the seats contested in Sunday’s election, which was marred by accusations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 19 people. Opponents rejected the election result but Hasina and her Awami League have denied any impropriety, saying that the vote was peaceful and there was enthusiastic participation from her supporters. “We urge the authorities to carry out prompt, independent, impartial and effective investigations into all alleged acts of violence and human rights violations related to the elections, with a view to holding accountable those responsible, regardless of their political affiliations,” the United Nations said. On Thursday, newly elected members of parliament, including Hasina, were sworn in, but the seven opposition members stayed away, saying the results were rigged and calling for a new election. “There are worrying indications that reprisals have continued to take place, notably against the political opposition, including physical attacks and ill-treatment, arbitrary arrests, harassment, disappearances and filing of criminal cases,” the United Nations said. “Reports suggest that violent attacks and intimidation, including against minorities, have been disproportionately carried out by ruling party activists, at times with complicity or involvement of law enforcement officers.” The United Nations called on the authorities to take urgent measures to prevent further reprisals, and to ensure that law enforcement authorities exercised their powers in accordance with the rule of law. It also urged the national Human Rights Commission to play an independent and proactive role. Western governments, including the United States and the European Union, have condemned the election-day violence and called for an investigation into a range of irregularities. On Thursday, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the run-up to the vote was characterised by “violence and intimidation against the opposition ... and the misuse of laws to limit free speech”.",0
" Shots were fired outside a building in central Cologne on Friday and one suspect has been detained, Bild newspaper reported on its website.

" As Ralph Snake walked across Washington’s National Mall on Wednesday, he stopped every few feet to pick up litter that has accumulated in the once-tidy expanse of grass since a budget showdown partially closed the federal government 12 days ago. “I decided to clean up this one section, because that’s what Americans will do,” said Snake, a 64-year-old member of the indigenous Ho-Chunk Nation in Wisconsin. Snake came to the U.S. capital to witness Sharice Davids get sworn in as one of the first two women of native American descent to become members of Congress. The partial shutdown, which has cut off many government services, entered its 12th day on Wednesday with no end in sight. It stems from an impasse between congressional Democrats, who control the House of Representatives as of Thursday, and President Donald Trump, who is demanding $5.6 billion (4.5 billion pounds) in funding for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. National parks have closed campgrounds out of fear that toilets will overflow with human waste. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are working without pay. The immigration court system, already suffocating under a backlog, is largely shuttered. The prospects for an end to the showdown remained unclear, even as congressional leaders visited the White House on Wednesday. In Washington, the 17 museums run by the Smithsonian as well as the National Zoo closed their doors on Wednesday after running out of emergency funding, leaving tourists frustrated with politicians of both parties. “It’s stupid,” said Laura Vanbragt, a 20-year-old student from Grand Rapids, Michigan. “There should just be more communication between the two, more give on both sides.” Outside the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Clint Woods and his family stood waiting for a guided tour with other visitors who were locked out of more popular venues. “It’s like two squabbling children,” Woods, 43, said of Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress. “They both think they’re right, and they’re dug in.” At Joshua Tree National Park, which is named after the spiked yucca plants that grow all over the park’s desert landscape, roads and scenic turnouts were full of cars on Wednesday but campgrounds were closed. Rock climbers Kiera Waskey, 21, and Stefan Nelson, 22, were able to camp in the park for three nights after arriving on a visit from Minnesota. “We were told that today we had to clean up camp and we can’t camp here anymore, which was a bummer,” Waskey said, standing near rock outcroppings dotted by several climbers. “I guess we take it for granted almost, these beautiful places that we have and we never thought we’d have to prepare for it (the shutdown),” he said. Public bathrooms and trash bins at the park were well kept, because volunteers were cleaning them, visitors said. The booth at the park’s entrance was closed, so visitors were able to roll in without paying an entrance fee. Frequent park visitors Marie Hoffman and Trevor Goodman, who are both 19 and students at University of California, Davis, said they noticed a lot more climbers and general visitor than they normally see at the park. “It looks like Disneyland today with just all the cars and everything, so many visitors,” Hoffman said, attributing the increased traffic to the temporary lack of an entrance fee. Unlike in some previous government shutdowns, many national parks have remained open, though without staff to collect trash and service restrooms. Advocates have voiced alarm that an extended shutdown could cause environmental damage. “We’re very concerned about the reports we’re seeing of human waste in inappropriate places,” said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriations for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Trash is a serious concern for wildlife.” The impact of the shutdown has reached the nation’s 62 immigration courts as well. Hundreds of judges are on furlough, and only cases of immigrants in detention are being heard. The Trump administration has expanded the system, which is run by the U.S. Department of Justice, aiming to cut down on the backlog of more than 800,000 cases, but the shutdown will complicate that effort, said Ashley Tabaddor, the president of the national immigration judges’ union. “To reschedule these cases can take several years because the judges are all booked,” she said. A Justice Department spokesman said he could not respond to a request for comment because of the shutdown. Meanwhile, some 800,000 government workers are either furloughed or working without pay until the shutdown ends. Shekina Givens, a 32-year-old Transportation Security Administration officer in Atlanta and president of the local chapter of a union that represents government employees, said she is avoiding using her credit cards and putting off some expenses. “I’m the only person that’s working in my household and paying all the bills,” she said.",0

" The Irish government is intensifying preparations for the possibility that Britain crashes out of the European Union without an exit deal even though it expects agreement in the coming weeks, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Friday. “I still expect that we will have a deal in the next few weeks, but it is only prudent of course that as every day passes that we intensify preparations for no deal and that is very much what Ireland is doing,” Varadkar told journalists in Germany where he is attending a meeting of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.",0
" Democratic Republic of Congo’s Catholic church said on Thursday it was clear which candidate won the country’s presidential election, and demanded that the electoral commission publish accurate results. The church, one of Congo’s most trusted institutions and representing about 40 percent of its 80 million population, based its finding on tallies from more than 40,000 observers it deployed for the Dec. 30 poll, meant to mark the country’s first democratic transfer of power. The church’s bishops conference, known as CENCO, did not say which candidate had won. But if its count points to victory for an opposition candidate, it could set up a standoff with outgoing President Joseph Kabila’s ruling coalition, which has insisted its man is poised to win. The CENCO mission and another domestic observer group, SYMOCEL, both said in reports on Thursday they witnessed widespread irregularities on election day, though they did not allege outright fraud. The electoral commission had been scheduled to publish provisional results on Sunday, but it said on Thursday that could be delayed because counting centres are still waiting for 80 percent of local vote tallies. The opposition says the delay could be used to manipulate vote totals. In Washington, the State Department called on Congo’s electoral commission, CENI, to ensure votes were accurately counted and threatened to impose sanctions against those who undermined the process or threatened peace and stability in the country. “We strongly urge the CENI to ensure that votes are counted in a transparent and open manner, with observers present, and that the results reported by CENI are accurate,” State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said. “Those who undermine the democratic process, threaten the peace, security or stability of the DRC, or benefit from corruption may find themselves not welcome in the United States and cut off from the U.S. financial system,” he said, referring to sanctions. Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende defended its handling of the election, saying public safety concerns justified a decision to cancel voting in the Ebola-hit cities of Beni and Butembo, and cutting internet access until the results were known was intended to stop the spread of false news about the outcome. The vote, meant to choose a successor to long-term leader Kabila, had been repeatedly delayed since 2016, when his mandate officially expired. Those delays sparked violent protests in which security forces killed dozens of people. Pre-election polling showed ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, Kabila’s preferred candidate, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi. Both Shadary and the opposition say they expect to win. The CENCO mission “observes that the figures in its possession from polling stations’ vote tallies reveal the choice of one candidate as president of the republic,” its secretary-general Donatien Nshole told reporters. “We call on the CENI ... to publish, with all responsibility, the results of the election that respect truth and justice.” Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, helped reunify the country amid civil war, and has presided over strong economic growth driven by exports of copper and cobalt, a component of electric car batteries. But critics say there has been little improvement in the quality of life for average Congolese and accuse the government of brutally suppressing dissent. More than one million Congolese were unable to cast ballots due to the cancellation of voting, which hit opposition strongholds and for which the electoral commission also cited ethnic violence. In areas where polls did go ahead, many were kept from voting because polling stations often opened late, closed early and voting machines sometimes did not work, according to SYMOCEL’s report based on what its staff saw at a third of voting centres. SYMOCEL said 24 percent of the polling stations it observed closed without allowing those already in line at closing time to cast their ballots, as required by law. Twenty-seven percent opened late and 18 percent had problems with malfunctioning voting machines. Seventeen percent of polling stations it observed allowed voting by people who either did not having voting cards or whose names were not on the voter roll, it said. CENCO’s report said that 38 percent of polling stations it observed were missing materials at the start of election day, and also noted ballot boxes that did not remain sealed before counting and polling stations that did not properly verify voters’ identities.

" The Gaza offices of President Mahmoud Abbas’s official Palestine Television station were attacked and ransacked on Friday, adding to tensions between his Palestinian Authority and the Islamist Hamas movement which rules the territory. Rafat Al-Qidra, the office director, said five men broke into the premises early on Friday and destroyed cameras, editing and broadcast equipment worth nearly $150,000. “Whoever rules in Gaza must afford protection to everyone here,” Qidra told Reuters. The station broadcasts material supportive of Abbas’s Western-backed Authority, whose power base lies in the West Bank. Station officials immediately blamed Hamas for the attack. “Hamas is deeply involved in this conspiracy,” said Ahmed Assaf, chairman of the Palestininan Broadcast Corporation (PBC), speaking to the channel in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The PBC issued a statement saying the attack was a “clear reflection of the mentality of the Hamas movement and criminal gangs who believe only in their voice, and who seek to suppress freedoms”. Neither Assaf nor the PBC offered any evidence for their accusations, and Hamas officials swiftly condemned the incident. “What happened is rejected, and we condemn it,” Eyad Al-Bozom said in a statement issued by the Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza. He urged the station’s officials to cooperate with investigators. There has long been antipathy between Hamas, which won the last Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and is opposed to any peace negotiations with Israel, and with Abbas’s more moderate and secular Fatah faction. The two rivals have failed to end the divisions since 2007. Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation pact that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas, but a dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation of the deal. The TV station was able to continue broadcasting from Gaza later in the day. The attack was widely condemned by other Palestinian political factions and by journalists.

" A woman aged 46 has become the third to enter the Sabarimala Hindu temple in south India in defiance of an ancient ban on females of menstruating age, the office of the chief minister of Kerala state said on Friday. It was not immediately clear how the woman, a Sri Lankan, had got in, and the temple management denied that she had in fact entered. The hill temple, which pays homage to the celibate god Ayyappan and draws millions of worshippers a year, is one of a few in India that bar entry to girls and women between the ages of 10 and 50, saying that menstruating women are impure. Conservative Hindu groups shut businesses and halted transport across Kerala on Thursday with a protest strike against the communist state government, which backs a Supreme Court ruling in September that ordered the lifting of the ban. The first two women to breach the ban arrived in an ambulance with a plainclothes police escort on Wednesday and went in through a side gate without any devotees noticing. The chief minister’s office said the third had gone to the temple with her husband, and had been offered police protection. Media identified her as Sasikala and reported that she had had her womb removed, which would mean she cannot menstruate. They said she had gone in at about 10:55 p.m. on Thursday. The temple has refused to abide by the court ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit had been blocked by thousands of devotees. It says the ban is necessary because menstruating women are impure, and denied that another woman had visited. “The chief minister’s office is lying,” said Ayyappa Dharma Sena leader of the temple and grandson of former chief priest Rahul Easwar. “The pictures of the Sri Lankan woman Sasikala being shown in the media are fake.” The protests against Kerala’s communist coalition, led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, were backed by both of the main national parties - Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party. A general election is due by May. On Friday, only small protests were reported from across the state. Fewer than 100 members of the Congress youth wing marched and shouted slogans against the chief minister in the city of Kochi. In some parts of South Asia, menstruating women are commonly forbidden to enter houses or temples or take part in festivals and community events.",0
" Four tourists from Finland and Sweden were presumed dead on Friday, two days after they were feared to have been swept away by an avalanche in Norway while skiing, police said. The avalanche occurred on Wednesday in the northern Norwegian region of Troms in an area popular with skiers. Three Finns and a Swede were skiing in the area and were reported to police as missing. A helicopter flew over the area where the avalanche occurred on Friday and spotted two transceivers used by skiers to give their positions when caught in an avalanche. On Thursday, ski tracks had been spotted going into the avalanche but not coming out. “This confirms our assumption that the missing have been caught in the avalanche. It has now been 38 hours since the avalanche took place,” Troms Police Chief Astrid Elisabeth Nilsen told a news conference. “Now that we have confirmed their positions, we believe it is no longer probable that any of the four have survived.”",0
" The French government on Friday dismissed ‘yellow vest’ protesters as agitators whose only goal was to topple it, signalling a toughening stance against a movement that has shaken Emmanuel Macron’s presidency. In his first cabinet meeting of the year, Macron told ministers they should be more radical in their attempt to reform the country and law and order must be restored, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said. The sometimes violent protests over the cost of living have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities and forced Macron to make concessions, including scrapping a planned fuel tax rise. Since then attendance at the protests has dwindled - some tallies put the turnout on Dec. 29 at 12,000, below the 40,000 the previous Saturday - but many demonstrators have said they will carry on. “Since these announcements, the yellow vest movement, for those who continue to protest, has become the thing of agitators who promote insurrection to topple the government,” Griveaux told reporters. “We must take the desire of the French for change to its fullest because it is this desire which brought us to power,” he said. “Maybe we have made too many concessions to conservatism, we’ll have to change that.” Since Macron swept to power in May 2017 promising to transform France and do away with a political class he blamed for the country’s malaise, he has seen his popularity slide to a record low as discontent with his style and policies grew. Facing the sternest challenge of his 20-month tenure, Macron has vowed to press on with other reform pledges, such as stricter rules for unemployment benefit and overhauling the civil service. One of the faces of the leaderless yellow vest movement, Eric Drouet, was detained on Wednesday for organising an undeclared protest, before being released on Thursday. Macron’s critics have called the tougher response a mistake likely to inflame the situation.

" Syrian Kurdish leaders aim to secure a Russian-mediated political deal with President Bashar al-Assad’s government regardless of U.S. plans to withdraw from their region, a senior Kurdish official told Reuters. The Kurdish-led administration that runs much of northern Syria presented a road map for an agreement with Assad during recent meetings in Russia and are awaiting Moscow’s response, Badran Jia Kurd, who attended, said. If such a deal could be agreed, it would piece back together the two biggest chunks of a country splintered by eight years of war and leave one corner of the northwest in the hands of anti-Assad rebels backed by Turkey. The talks with Russia and new overtures towards Damascus underline a recalibration of Kurdish strategy since President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw U.S. forces whose presence has stabilised the Kurdish-led region. Their immediate priority is to find a way to shield the region from Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia as a national security threat. Turkey has already sent its army into Syria twice to roll back the YPG. But it has held off attacking the large Kurdish-controlled area of the northeast where U.S. forces operate. Trump, who has not set out a withdrawal timetable, said on Wednesday the United States would leave slowly “over a period of time”. He also said the United States wanted to protect Kurds, who have been vital to the U.S. campaign against Islamic State. Jia Kurd welcomed the idea of a slow withdrawal but said the United States had not discussed the pullout with its Syrian allies who were caught off guard by Trump’s announcement. To fill the expected vacuum, they want Russia to help secure a Syrian army deployment at the northern border. This is part of a wider effort to strike a deal with Damascus they hope will also safeguard their regional autonomy. Jia Kurd said Russia had agreed to mediate. “The final decision is (to reach an) agreement with Damascus, we will work in this direction regardless of the cost, even if the Americans object,” Jia Kurd said in the northern Syrian city of Qamishli. “Our view is that (Russia) is trying to open new horizons with Damascus, this is what we sensed from them.” Damascus and the YPG have mostly avoided confrontation during the war. At times, they have even fought common foes. They convened political talks last year in Damascus, but these broke down without progress. Jia Kurd said the need for Damascus to enter serious dialogue was now more pressing. The main aims of the road-map are to protect the border from Turkey, to find a way to integrate the governing structures of northern Syria into the constitution, and to ensure a fair distribution of resources in northern and eastern Syria. “The ball is in the court of Russia and Damascus,” Jia Kurd said. “On this basis we can negotiate and start a dialogue.” One of the biggest challenges will be reconciling the regional autonomy demands with Assad’s goal of exercising authority over the whole country again. The Syrian foreign minister recently said a federal Syria was unacceptable. Jia Kurd said “conservative” elements in Damascus wanted to ignore political changes and to “impose their control and influence” through the kind of agreements forced on areas where anti-Assad rebels had been defeated. “This is rejected by us,” he said. The Kurds’ bargaining chips include control of dams on the Euphrates River, oil fields and other resources. Jia Kurd said these would be one main element of the dialogue. Analysts however say their bargaining position has been weakened by Trump’s announcement, which heightened Kurdish fears of a Turkish offensive. Turkey views the YPG militia as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waved a 34-year insurgency in Turkey. Analysts believe Assad and the YPG could eventually work together against Turkey-backed rebels in northwestern Syria. Jia Kurd said ending the Turkish occupation and defeating the remaining insurgents there required an agreement between Damascus and the Kurdish-led administration: “This will give a big push towards ending the occupation and terrorism in Syria.”",0
" Spain has replaced Italy as the destination of choice for migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, according to European Union estimates published on Friday. The border and coast guard agency Frontex said around 150,000 people entered the EU through irregular crossings in 2018, the lowest number in five years and far below the peak of more than a million recorded in 2015. Arrivals in Spain doubled to 57,000, making the route from Morocco to the Iberian Peninsula the most active in Europe and putting immigration in the spotlight in Spain ahead of a spate of elections this year. The number who reached Italy, which has taken measures to prevent rescued migrants landing, fell 80 percent to around 23,000, the fewest since 2012. Arrivals in Greece and Cyprus through the so-called Eastern Mediterranean route rose to 56,000, most coming from Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq. Spain’s coastguard said it had stopped posting regular information about rescues of migrants at sea on social media, though it continued to give information to journalists who call. The decision prompted criticism from the new far-right party Vox, whose centralist, anti-immigrant message unexpectedly won it 12 seats in a regional election in Andalusia last month. Vox leader Santiago Abascal took aim at Socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez, who has offered to take in migrants, including more than 600 mainly sub-Saharan Africans from a stranded charity rescue ship. “It is incredible that the government is hiding the numbers in the drama that Pedro Sanchez caused,” Abascal tweeted. He said Sanchez was in effect encouraging migrants to head for Spain. A government spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Vox is gaining ground in opinion polls, but there are huge differences in how far and how fast. An official poll released on Friday saw it attracting 3.7 percent of votes if a general election were held now, days after a Sigma Dos survey suggested it would get 13 percent.",0
" Colombia’s government said on Friday it has asked Venezuela to verify whether certain members of the ELN rebel group are living in the country and to detain them under Interpol red notices if they are. Colombia has long accused Venezuela’s socialist government of turning a blind eye to the presence of groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) in areas close to the two countries’ border. Former commanders of the rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which demobilized in 2017, were believed to have stayed in Venezuela in a bid to avoid capture. Colombia sent a note to the government of President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday, the foreign ministry said in a statement, to request Venezuela “verify the presence and continuity in its territory of some members of the ELN.” If ELN members Eliecer Herlinto Chamorro Acosta, known as Antonio Garcia, Gustavo Anibal Giraldo Quinchia, known as Pablito, and Rafael Sierra Granados, known as Ramiro Vargas, are in Venezuela, Colombia asks that it carry out red notices against them, the statement added. Interpol notices list people wanted for extradition. The ELN said in a statement on Friday it had successfully completed a 12-day ceasefire during the festive period. Maduro will be sworn in for a new term next week, after being re-elected in a May election considered a sham by the opposition.

" President Donald Trump has asked congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday for talks aimed at ending a partial government shutdown over a dispute on border security funding, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday. Speaking after a meeting of congressional leaders with Trump at the White House, McCarthy said he believed the president wanted to find a solution to the crisis. “We know that we have a challenge along the border. We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well,” McCarthy said. Democrats said they would proceed with plans to hold votes on Thursday, when they formally take control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Trump’s fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing money for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump sought. The White House has called the two-part package a “non-starter.” “We’re asking the president to open up government,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive House speaker, told reporters outside the White House after top lawmakers met with Trump and his homeland security officials.",0
" Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Wednesday cut U.S. prices for all its vehicles to offset lower green tax credits, and fell short on quarterly deliveries of its mass-market Model 3 sedan, sending shares of the electric vehicle maker down nearly 7 percent on worries of future profitability. Analysts questioned whether the $2,000 price cut on all models signaled lower demand in the United States, and ultimately whether the move would undermine nascent profitability at the Silicon Valley automaker, which has never posted an annual profit. “In our view, this move could suggest that what many bulls assume to be a substantial backlog ... for Tesla may be less robust,” wrote Bank of America analyst John Murphy in a client note. Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has often set goals and deadlines that Tesla has failed to meet, surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make Tesla profitable in the third quarter, for only the third time in its 15-year existence. But the company is unprofitable for the first nine months of 2018, and cash flow remains a concern for investors. Musk has been under intense pressure to deliver on his promise of stabilizing production for the Model 3, which is deemed crucial for easing a cash crunch and achieving long-term profitability. It said it was churning out almost 1,000 Model 3s daily, broadly in line with Musk’s promises but slightly short of Wall Street expectations. The company said it would begin delivering Model 3s to Europe and China in February. The price cut of $2,000 beginning on Wednesday on the Model 3 - as well as on its higher-priced Model S and Model X - took the market by surprise and weighed on the stock, pushing it down 6.8 percent to close at $310.12, after falling as much as 10 percent during the session. The lower price comes as automakers expect U.S. new vehicle sales to weaken in 2019, and amid increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants. Tesla sales benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyers will now receive only half that amount. Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in 2017, tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out. “The price cut is what’s driving the stock lower, as it openly acknowledges the sunset of subsidy dollars is a material headwind,” said Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners. But some said fears of eroded demand were overblown. Gene Munster of Loup Ventures calculated that the lowered tax credit equaled, on average, a 3 percent discount on a Tesla. If Tesla had a demand issue, therefore, the company would have cut its prices by more than 3 percent, he wrote in a note. General Motors sold its 200,000th electric vehicle in the United States in 2018, similarly triggering a phase-out of the federal tax credit, a source said on Wednesday. GM declined to comment. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett estimated in a client note that if Tesla continues to deliver cars at the current rate, the price cut will mean $700 million in lost revenue in 2019. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, meanwhile, said the price cut was “a potential positive” for demand, “but not what the bulls wanted to hear on the impact to profitability and ultimately the bottom line.” Tesla delivered 63,150 Model 3s in its fourth quarter, falling short of FactSet estimates of 64,900. Tesla said that based on its own compilation of analysts’ forecasts, its delivery numbers were in line with market expectations. Bank of America analyst John Murphy wrote that the numbers were in line with market consensus, though below the bank’s estimate of 71,500 Model 3s. Total deliveries rose from the third quarter to 90,700 cars, but missed forecasts, which had been influenced by analysts’ expectations of a surge in buyers looking to cash in on the tax credit before year-end. Reuters calculated that Tesla’s third-quarter pretax profit was around $3,200 per vehicle delivered. That would mean a $2,000 price cut could eliminate more than half of that gain. For the first nine months of 2018, the company suffered a third-quarter loss per vehicle delivered of $8,019. Overall, total production rose 8 percent to 86,555 vehicles. The company churned out 61,394 Model 3s, up from a total of 53,239 Model 3s in the third quarter. “Tesla disappointed the market. The deliveries are below our estimates and the consensus estimates. I don’t expect that Tesla operates in the black in 2019,” said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD/LB.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump rebuffed sharp criticism from fellow Republican Mitt Romney on Wednesday, heaping scorn on the incoming senator in a sign of tensions to come in Washington even before a new Congress is officially sworn in. Romney, who starts work on Thursday when members of the 2019-2020 Congress take office, suggested in a newspaper essay published on Tuesday that Trump had “caused dismay around the world” and said his presidency had “made a deep descent in December.” “On balance, his conduct over the past two years ... is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office,” said Romney in the Washington Post essay, reprising a strong critique of Trump that he voiced during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump responded with a tweet on Wednesday, noting Romney’s failed 2012 White House bid and also taking a shot at former Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who has just retired from Congress and who has been one of the few Republican lawmakers to be openly critical of the president. “Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump repeated this theme later during a cabinet meeting, saying he wished Romney could be more of a “team player.” The president, a businessman and television star with no prior government experience, caused deep divisions in the party when he won the Republican White House nomination and then the election in 2016, upending party orthodoxy on foreign policy, deficits and other issues and governing in sometimes turbulent style. But public criticism from Republican lawmakers has been rare. It was unclear whether any other prominent members of the party would feel emboldened to criticise Trump ahead of his presumed 2020 re-election bid, or whether the president will face any serious challengers for the party’s White House nomination. Senator Rand Paul, a conservative Republican, took Romney to task on a conference call. “You’ll find the vast majority (of Republican lawmakers) will wish he hadn’t said it,” said Paul. Brushing aside the fact that Trump often personally attacks and insults other politicians, Paul said Romney’s criticism of the president’s character was a “big mistake” and an attempt by the new senator to present himself as “holier than thou.” “Some might say it’s sour grapes at not having won the (presidential) post himself,” said Paul. He added: “I don’t think there’s an appetite for a Romney run (for president) in the Republican Party.” Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel also criticized Romney, saying on Twitter his essay was an attack on Trump that was “disappointing and unproductive.” McDaniel is a niece of Romney. Seven years ago, Romney was the party’s presidential nominee, running with Paul Ryan, who retired from Congress last month. Romney lost to then incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama. Paul also took a run at the presidency. He dropped out early in 2016 from the Republican primary race that Trump won. Representatives for Romney could not be immediately reached for comment on the tweets and remarks by Trump, Paul and McDaniel. Romney and Trump traded barbs during the 2016 campaign, with Romney calling Trump a “fraud” and Trump slamming Romney’s 2012 loss. The two later appeared to bury the hatchet, with Trump briefly considering Romney to be his secretary of state and endorsing Romney’s 2018 run for the Senate. But in Tuesday’s essay, Romney wrote of Trump, “The appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs all defined his presidency down.” He promised to speak his mind in Washington, which will now feature a divided Congress as Republicans retain a majority in the Senate and Democrats take control of the House of Representatives, after Republicans lost their House majority in November’s elections. “I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” Romney wrote.

" German shipping line Hapag Lloyd said on Friday that it was trying to extinguish a fire on its Yantian Express container vessel off Canada’s east coast but was being hampered by bad weather. A spokesman for Hapag Lloyd said the fire broke out on Thursday in a container on deck and spread to some other containers on the vessel, but the cause was not yet known. The 7,519 twenty foot equivalent ship was on its way from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Halifax in Nova Scotia via the Suez Canal, and was currently sailing at a slow speed around 650 nautical miles off the east coast of Canada. Strong winds meant attempts to extinguish the fire had to be halted on Friday, with the hope of restarting on Saturday, the spokesman said. A second ship was nearby to support the Yantian Express and a tugboat was on its way to help spray the front end of the vessel, he said. The crew of eight officers and 15 seafarers remained on board but were safe, the spokesman said. “We are taking it very seriously,” he said. “The next steps hinge on weather conditions.” The German-flagged ship was built in 2002 and is 320 metres long. The fire follows another shipping incident this week when the Panamanian-flagged MSC ZOE container vessel lost part of its cargo in heavy seas off the Dutch and German coast.",0
" A doctors’ strike in Zimbabwe has not been called off, a representative said on Friday, after state media said the action had ended following a meeting between medical staff and first lady Auxilla Mnangagwa. The nationwide strike, now into its second month, is to demand better pay and conditions in a country grappling with severe dollar shortages and spiralling inflation. Mthabisi Bebhe, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, told Reuters that contrary to reports in the state-owned newspaper, the Herald, the association had not yet consulted members after the meeting. “Members of the executive met with (Auxilla Mnangagwa) but no agreement was reached,” Bebhe said. “The strike has not been called off.” Auxilla Mnangagwa is an advocate on health issues. The doctors’ first strike in March last year marked the first major labour dispute faced by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is under pressure to repair an economy suffering after decades of missteps by his predecessor Robert Mugabe. Public hospitals have been left short of drugs and reliant on patients to buy them, while pharmacies have stopped accepting insurance policies for purchases and demand payment in U.S. dollars. Mnangagwa said in a video posted by the Information Ministry on Friday that the doctors had shared their concerns during the meeting and expressed their willingness to return to work. “I will ask the relevant authorities to handle their demands,” he said.",0
" The United Arab Emirates must release pro-democracy campaigner Ahmed Mansoor, whose 10-year jail sentence for criticising the government on social media was upheld this week, the U.N. human rights office said on Friday. The state security court’s ruling against Mansoor, who prior to his imprisonment had been one of a tiny number of publicly active rights campaigners in the UAE, was confirmed by the state news agency WAM. “We are concerned that Mansoor’s conviction and harsh sentencing relate to his exercise of the right to freedom of expression and opinion,” U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva. “We urge the government of the UAE to promptly and unconditionally release Mansoor and to ensure that individuals are not penalised for expressing views critical of the government or its allies,” she said. The ruling, upholding the May 2018 conviction, which is not subject to appeal, was accompanied by a fine of 1 million dirham ($270,000). A trade and tourism hub, the UAE is an absolute monarchy which tolerates little public criticism. “This is certainly not a one-off case in the UAE,” Shamdasani said. Prominent critic Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced in March 2017 to 10 years in prison for tweeting about human rights violations in Egypt and criticising the politicization of the judiciary in the UAE, she said. Mansoor, a 49-year-old electrical engineer and poet, was among five activists convicted of insulting the UAE’s rulers in 2011. They were pardoned the same year. He was arrested again in March 2017 on charges of publishing false information and rumours, promoting a sectarian and hate-incited agenda, and using social media to “harm national unity and social harmony and damage the country’s reputation”. In 2015 Mansoor received the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, an annual prize awarded in Geneva by a panel of international human rights organisations, for his work documenting the human rights situation in the UAE.",0
" Zimbabwe’s government has begun laying off just over 3,000 workers from its youth ministry, as it tries to make good on its promise to cut the bloated civil service and sort out the country’s finances. Public sector salaries account for more than 90 percent of Zimbabwe’s $4 billion national budget — a situation seen as unsustainable by foreign lenders like the International Monetary Fund, with which Zimbabwe would eventually like to secure an economic reform programme. In a statement, the Public Service Commission said it would cut 3,365 youth officers from the Ministry of Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation on Friday, in line with a plan announced in November’s budget. “The Youth officers will be paid their cash in lieu of accrued days leave and cash in lieu of notice,” it said. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is under pressure to repair an economy shattered during nearly four decades of rule by Robert Mugabe, who had blocked efforts to cut public salaries before being removed in an army coup in late 2017. However Mnangagwa’s administration is grappling with a crippling dollar shortage and growing budget deficit, as well as tarnished investor confidence in a country once known as Africa’s breadbasket. In October, Zimbabwe’s cabinet approved an economic recovery programme taking aim at the wage bill. Cutting unnecessary spending will be key to helping the country clear more than $2 billion in arrears to creditors — a precondition to IMF support.",0
" Taliban fighters are threatening major oil wells near the northern Afghan city of Sar-e Pul following days of fighting in which dozens of members of the security forces have been killed and wounded, officials and residents said on Friday. “The security situation in Sar-e Pul province is alarming,” said Zabiullah Amani, the provincial governor’s spokesman. “We have had promises that reinforcements would be sent to the city but nothing has been done yet,” he said. About 40 members of the security forces were killed or wounded near Sar-e Pul on Tuesday during hours of fighting that underlined the heavy pressure Afghan government forces are facing even as moves towards peace have intensified. “The Taliban have been launching major attacks for some time with the aim of securing these oil fields and we’ve set up a special protection force but they don’t have advanced equipment,” Amani said. The wells in the Angot field, about 11 km east of Sar-e Pul city and Kashkari, 12 km to the south, were developed during the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. Amani said eight wells were active, with millions of dollars’ worth of military equipment, including armoured vehicles stored close by. “These wells are economically important, not just for the province of Sar-e Pul but for the whole of Afghanistan,” he said. The capture of the wells would deliver a blow to the government and bolster Taliban finances, adding to revenues from taxation, mining and opium. An aide to interior minister Amrullah Saleh said additional forces had been sent to the oil fields from neighbouring districts and a team from Kabul would be sent in coming days. “As of now, the area is secure but we cannot deny the threat warning,” he said, adding that companies operating the wells had been alerted. The fighting comes as another round of talks is expected between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives to try to work out the basis for peace talks to end the 17-year Afghan war. With U.S. intentions unclear following reports that President Donald Trump is preparing to withdraw almost half of the estimated 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan, pressure on Afghan forces has been mounting. Hekmat Haidari, a resident of Sar-e Pul city, said the situation in the province had been deteriorating sharply over recent days as the Taliban have stepped up operations. “The oil wells in this province are a major source of income for Afghanistan and specially for Sar-e Pul province and the Taliban are trying to capture these wells or to destroy them,” he said.

" Naples is ready to defy Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and let in a charity-run ship carrying 32 migrants that is blocked in the stormy Mediterranean, the city mayor said on Thursday. His offer adds to a growing challenge from opposition politicians to Salvini’s far-right League, which has vowed to bar migrants and make life difficult for those already here. Both Italy and Malta are refusing to let the Sea-Watch 3, a ship operated by a German non-governmental organisation (NGO), dock and set down the migrants who were rescued off Libya on Dec. 22. Both countries say they have taken in too many migrants and accuse NGO rescue ships of acting as a taxi service for would-be refugees. Naples’ centre-left mayor Luigi de Magistris said Salvini was playing politics with peoples’ lives. “To leave people and children in the middle of cold and stormy seas is a crime — not simply indecent, immoral and appalling,” de Magistris told Radio Crc. “I hope that this boat approaches the port of Naples because, unlike what the government says, we will launch a rescue operation and we will let it enter the port,” he said. “I will be the first to lead the rescue.” Naples is hundreds of miles to the north of the Sea-Watch 3 and there was no immediate response from the boat to the offer. Malta overnight allowed the boat into its waters to sail closer to land where the seas are less choppy, but is refusing to let it dock. Several local politicians from opposition parties have defied Salvini’s anti-migrant policies. On Wednesday, the mayor of the Sicilian capital Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, said he would join other cities in ignoring a new security law because it abolishes asylum protection for many migrants. Salvini on Thursday threatened mayors with legal action. “Anyone who helps clandestine migrants hates Italians. They will answer for their actions before the law and the history books. I will not back down,” Salvini tweeted. “Italy’s ports are closed. We have taken in too many fake refugees. We have enriched too many people-smugglers. Left-wing mayors should think of the difficulties of their own citizens and not clandestine migrants.” On taking office last year, Salvini barred NGO boats and moved to help Libya prevent people leaving its shores. Some 12,977 migrants entered Italy in 2018 via boats from Libya, down 87.9 percent on 2017 and 92.85 percent on 2016, according to government data.",0
" Spain’s ruling Socialists would win most votes if an election were held today but would not have a majority, while the far-right Vox would see its support rise slightly, an opinion poll showed on Friday. The official poll by the Centre for Sociological Studies (CIS) showed that it would likely be hard for any party, or group of parties, to pull together a coalition that would have a majority of seats. Spanish politics, dominated since dictator Francisco Franco’s death in 1975 by the Socialists and the conservative People’s Party (PP), have become increasingly fragmented over the past years. The CIS poll forecast that Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’ Socialists would win 28.9 percent of the vote, more than any other party but its worst score since taking power in June. A parliamentary election is not scheduled before 2020, but the Socialists hold fewer than a quarter of the seats and speculation has been rife over the possibility that an early election could be held this year. Vox would get 3.7 percent of the vote according to the CIS poll, up from 2.5 percent in its survey carried out in November and up from 1.3 percent in October. That is still well below the 13 percent of votes forecast for Vox by Sigma Dos pollsters in a survey published by El Mundo earlier this week, a sign of how hard it is for pollsters to estimate the far-right party’s popularity. The anti-immigration Vox unexpectedly won 12 seats in a regional election in Andalusia in December, becoming a kingmaker there. Vox has been dominating headlines, telling the PP and centre-right Ciudadanos, who depend on its votes to rule the region, that it would only back them if they agreed to policy changes, including on laws protecting women against sexist violence, which it says discriminate against men. The CIS poll sees PP getting 19.1 percent of the vote in an election, unchanged from last month’s poll, while Ciudadanos would drop slightly to 17.9 percent and the far-left Podemos would get 14.9 percent. The rest of the votes would be spread among smaller parties. CIS describes itself as an independent administrative body. Its surveys are considered in Spain as official opinion polls.",0

" The United Nations human rights office called on Bahrain on Friday to release activist Nabeel Rajab, saying that the upholding of his five-year jail sentence by the top court this week showed “continued suppression of government critics”. An outspoken critic of the Bahraini government who played a prominent role in pro-democracy protests in 2011, Rajab was convicted in February over social media posts in which he accused the prison authorities of torture and criticised Saudi Arabia’s air strikes in Yemen. “Monday’s court decision brings into focus the continued suppression of government critics in Bahrain through arbitrary arrest and detention, travel bans, harassment, threats, revocation of citizenship and other means,” U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a Geneva news briefing.",0

" European shares lost further ground in their first trading day of 2019 on Wednesday as fears about global growth, trade wars and political instability rolled over into the new year while investors sought safety in stocks considered less risky. While sentiment had already been hit by disappointing data from China, fresh surveys showed Euro zone manufacturing activity barely expanded at the end of 2018 in a broad-based slowdown. Euro zone stocks .STOXXE ended down just 0.3 percent and the pan European STOXX 600 closed 0.2 percent lower after trimming earlier heavy losses as Wall Street turned positive. Paris .FCHI notched up the biggest drop, down 1 percent, while Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan all managed to move back into positive territory by the close. Turnover on the STOXX 600 was extremely low, though - with just 75 percent of the 90-day average daily volume traded - as many investors remained on holiday. “Investors are still cautious about the outlook for the second largest economy in the world,” said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. “China has been undergoing an economic slowdown for years, and the manufacturing report underlined the point that the second largest economy in the world is cooling.” Some analysts drew comfort from the tentative turnaround in market fortunes on the day as investors tried to put 2018 - which saw the worst stock market performance in a decade - behind them. “Bruised by the volatility of Q4 2018, investors aren’t yet grabbing the chance to buy the dip with both hands, but it is at least encouraging to see a continuation of the move higher instead of the relentless selling of the past few weeks,” said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp. Still, the laggards of 2018 took some of the biggest hits. Miners, autos and banks fell, and investors dumped the cyclical parts of the market most exposed to a slowing global economy. The basic resources sector .SXPP was the weakest performer, dropping 1.8 percent, while autos and parts stocks fell 1.5 percent. Among individual moves, medical equipment maker Gerresheimer (GXIG.DE) dropped 5.8 percent to its lowest since July 2015 after JP Morgan cut its rating on the stock to “underweight”, according to traders. Bargain hunting in crude futures helped heavyweight oil stocks .SXEP reverse earlier losses to rise 1.1 percent on the day, while defensive stocks popular in times of economic strife - healthcare, utilities and telecom - were in favour. In Italy, market watchdog Consob suspended trading in shares of Banca Carige (CRGI.MI) while the European Central Bank appointed temporary administrators in a bid to save the struggling lender after it failed to raise capital late last year. The Italian banking sector .FTIT8300 was down 1.1 percent.",0
" Six people were killed when a passenger train hit a freight trailer that had blown off a wagon coming the other way on a bridge linking Denmark’s two main islands on Wednesday, officials said. The train with 131 passengers on board was heading towards the capital, Copenhagen, when it hit the trailer. Apart from the dead, 16 people were injured but were not in critical condition, police said. The accident happened shortly before 7.35 a.m. (0635 GMT) during a severe storm that hampered the rescue operation on the 18-km (11-mile) Great Belt Bridge between Zealand and Funen, Denmark’s two major islands. “This morning’s tragic accident on the Great Belt Bridge with many killed and wounded has shaken us all,” Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen tweeted. “Ordinary Danes on their way to work or on the way home from Christmas holidays have had their lives shattered.” A preliminary investigation by the Danish Accident Investigation Board showed a trailer had blown off a freight wagon onto the oncoming tracks, a spokesman said. “There was a very, very loud bang and then the train stopped,” a witness who had been onboard the train with his daughter told broadcaster TV2. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven blamed the weather. “Terrible train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark as a result of the storm Alfrida. Our thoughts are with the injured and with the families and relatives of the dead,” he tweeted. TV footage showed a severely damaged freight trailer adorned with the logo of Danish beer maker Carlsberg. Crates of beer could be seen inside. A train operated by DB Cargo, the logistics arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bahn which carries goods from Carlsberg’s Fredericia brewery to Copenhagen, was involved in the accident, a Carlsberg spokesman said. DB Cargo was on site and “doing its utmost to support the investigation”, Deutsche Bahn said in a statement. A spokesman said the trailers were fastened to the railcars with metal rods, a system in use across Europe. The bridge remained closed for trains while car traffic in both directions resumed. Danish rail operator Banedanmark said it did not expect rail traffic by to resume before Thursday. The Great Belt, part of a route that links Denmark and Sweden to Germany, carries around 21,000 train passengers and more than 27,000 vehicles each day.

" British police said on Wednesday they were increasingly confident that a man who attacked three people with a kitchen knife at Manchester’s Victoria station on New Year’s Eve acted alone. Police had already said that the 25-year-old man had been detained under the Mental Health Act. He is now in a secure medical facility. “The investigation has moved at a very fast pace and detectives are increasingly confident that the man acted alone in the final stages of the attack,” Greater Manchester Police said in a statement. “The investigation will continue and will examine if anybody may have encouraged or assisted the man to commit the attack.”",0
" The United Nations human rights office said on Friday it could not assess the fairness of a trial taking place in Saudi Arabia related to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but that in any case it was “not sufficient”. Spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani, asked about reports that a Saudi prosecutor had sought the death sentence for five suspects linked to the Oct. 2 killing, reiterated the office’s call for an independent investigation “with international involvement”. The U.N. rights office always opposed the death penalty, she added.",0
" Thailand’s first tropical storm in three decades killed one person on Friday as it arrived on the south coast, knocking down trees and blowing off roofs in its path, but was losing speed, officials said, while warning against the risk of flash floods. Accompanying winds churned up high waves and gusts in the Gulf of Thailand as tropical storm Pabuk made landfall in the Pak Phanang district of Nakhon Si Thammarat province, where trees crashed down on houses to cause widespread damage. Disaster mitigation officials said the person killed was among the crew of a fishing boat that capsized in strong winds near the coast of nearby Pattani province. Another of the crew was missing, but four others were safe. Weather officials warned of torrential downpours and strong winds in 15 provinces in the Thai south, home to one of the world’s largest natural rubber plantations and several islands thronged by tourists. But by Friday afternoon, the storm was slowing, and was heading for the province of Surat Thani, the Thai Meteorological Department said in a statement. “It is expected to downgrade to be a tropical depression,” it added. “People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods.” The conditions are expected to persist into Saturday. With airports and ferry services shut, people were advised to stay indoors until the storm passed. The National Disaster Warning Center also sounded alarms around tourist beach destinations, such as Koh Samui and Koh Phangan, urging people to leave high-risk areas for higher ground. During the past few days, 6,176 people have been evacuated to shelters from Nakhon Si Thammarat as well as the provinces of Pattani, Songkhla and Yala, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation has said. The Nakhon Si Thammarat airport said it had closed, and low-cost Nok Airlines Pcl (NOK.BK) said it had cancelled all eight flights to and from the province. The Surat Thani airport will also close from Friday afternoon to Saturday, cancelling flights by Nok Airlines, Lion Air, and Thai Smile, a subsidiary of national carrier Thai Airways (THAI.BK). Earlier, Bangkok Airways Pcl (BA.BK) said it had cancelled all flights to and from the holiday destination of Koh Samui, where ferry services have also been suspended. National energy company PTT Exploration and Production Pcl (PTTEP.BK) said it had suspended operations at Bongkot and Erawan, two of the country’s biggest gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand.",0
" Canada said on Thursday that 13 of its citizens have been detained in China since Huawei Technologies Co Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested last month in Vancouver at the request of the United States. “At least” eight of those 13 had since been released, the Canadian government said in a statement, without disclosing what charges if any have been laid. Prior to Thursday’s statement, detention of only three Canadian citizens had been publicly disclosed. Diplomatic tension between Canada and China has intensified since Meng’s arrest on Dec. 1. The Canadian government has said several times it sees no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, and the detentions of Canadian citizens. But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believe the detentions were a “tit-for-tat” reprisal by China. Meng was released on a C$10 million (5.9 million pounds) bail on Dec. 11 and is living in one of her two multi-million-dollar Vancouver homes as she fights extradition to the United States. The 46-year-old executive must wear an ankle monitor and stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. The 13 Canadians detained include Michael Kovrig, Michael Spavor and Sarah McIver, a Canadian government official who declined to be identified, said on Thursday. McIver, a teacher, has since been released and returned to Canada. Kovrig and Spavor remain in custody. Canadian consular officials saw them once each in mid-December. Overall, there are about 200 Canadians who have been detained in China for a variety of alleged infractions who continue to face on-going legal proceedings. “This number has remained relatively stable,” the official said. In comparison, there are almost 900 Canadians in a similar situation in the United States, the official added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang did not provide details about the other detained Canadians at a news briefing in Beijing on Friday, but said that China was ruled by law and it protected the legal rights of foreigners. The Chinese government has not drawn a direct link between the detention of any Canadian and Meng’s arrest. It has demanded that Canada free Meng and threatened unspecified consequences if it does not.",0
" The secure internal network of Germany’s government has not been affected by the hacking incident, Bild newspaper said on Friday, citing sources inside the state’s security agency BSI.

Public broadcaster ARD television said earlier on Friday that hackers had posted personal data from hundreds of German politicians from major parties, including credit card details and mobile phone numbers.",0
" An Australian man rammed his four-wheel drive into a Sydney police car, hijacked a supermarket delivery truck and taxi, rammed other cars and stabbed and wounded a passerby before killing himself in front of police on Friday. The dramatic chain of events, which police said was not terror-related, began when police tried to pull over the four-wheel drive for not displaying licence plates. The driver rammed the police car, dumped the four-wheel drive and hijacked a supermarket delivery truck about 7 km away, then continued across town for another 20 km to a suburb near the airport, hitting several cars along the way. The driver, 24, tried to steal another car, stabbing a passerby who tried to stop him, before stealing a taxi. Police finally stopped the attacker in the taxi and tried to Taser him, but the man stabbed himself in the chest and died at the scene. “The offender wasn’t trying to intentionally harm people,” Acting Assistant Commissioner Mick Fitzgerald told reporters in Sydney. “It was a man who was attempting to do everything he could to avoid arrest. His actions, in particular the actions when he stabbed the innocent person, (are) the actions of a person who we believe had mental health problems.” Police did not identify the attacker or give further details. Fitzgerald said the man was known to police and did not have a significant criminal history. Footage circulated on social media showed a man in a beige shirt and cap gesturing for a taxi driver to get out of his car, then getting in and driving the red taxi away. The Australian Associated Press quoted a tradesman who witnessed the first stabbing, Chris Burton, as saying the attacker looked “crazy and frazzled”. “He goes to the guy, ‘stab me, stab me, stab me’ and stuck his neck out,” AAP quoted the witness as saying. The passerby who was stabbed was in a serious but stable condition in hospital, police said. Media reported that a woman was also stabbed in the melee but police did not confirm a second stabbing. A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on alert for militant attacks after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014 and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny. In November, a man set fire to a pickup truck laden with gas cylinders in Melbourne and stabbed three people, killing one, before being shot by police. Police described that rampage as an act of terrorism. Editing by Mike Perry and Nick Macfie All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" The U.S. State Department on Thursday renewed its warning for U.S. citizens travelling in China to exercise increased caution due to “arbitrary enforcement of local laws” amid heightened diplomatic tensions over the arrest in Canada of a Chinese technology company executive. The updated travel advisory maintains the warning at “Level 2” but also warns about extra security checks and increased police presence in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. The advisory follows the detentions by Chinese authorities in December of Canadians Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor. China says both men were suspected of endangering state security. Tensions with China increased after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec. 1 in Vancouver at the request of the United States. U.S. prosecutors have accused her of misleading banks about transactions linked to Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. Earlier on Thursday, China’s top prosecutor said the two Canadians had “without a doubt” violated the law. In its previous travel advisory for China issued on Jan. 22 last year, the State Department urged Americans to “exercise increased caution” in the country because of “the arbitrary enforcement of local laws and special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese nationals.” The latest advisory repeats that warning but adds: “Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.” The advisory also warns about China’s use of “exit bans” that would prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving the country, sometimes keeping them in China for years. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Friday that China always welcomes foreigners, including Americans, but expects them to respect and abide by Chinese law. “The U.S. side’s issuance of this travel advisory frankly does not hold water,” Lu said.",0
" India’s ruling and opposition parties condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments this week mocking New Delhi’s role in war-torn Afghanistan, where the South Asian country has invested billion of dollars in economic projects and military training. The United States and India have drawn closer in recent years as they seek ways to counter-balance China’s spreading influence across Asia. But Trump’s apparent bid to undermine India’s developmental work in Afghanistan has annoyed not just politicians but also many ordinary Indians. Trump said on Wednesday he got along very well with Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi but that Modi was “constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan”. “You know what that is? That’s like five hours of what we spend,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “And we are supposed to say, ‘oh, thank you for the library’. I don’t know who is using it in Afghanistan.” It was not immediately clear which library Trump was referring to, but both Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Congress were united in their criticism of the U.S. president. India has centuries-old ties with Afghanistan and both accuse common neighbour Pakistan of not doing enough to stop Islamist militants operating on their territory. Pakistan denies the charges. “May be Trump should know that while he is decrying every other help in Afghanistan, India has been building not only libraries, but roads, dams, schools and even parliament building,” Ram Madhav, a BJP general secretary, said on Twitter. “We are building lives, for which the Afghan people thank us, no matter what others do or don’t.” Congress said India did not “need sermons from the U.S on Afghanistan”. The United States has 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, with reports it may be set to withdraw more than 5,000, a sign Trump’s patience is thinning with America’s longest war. Trump has already decided to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria. Modi’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment. Reuters could not reach the White House outside regular business hours in the United States. India is the biggest South Asian donor to Afghanistan, spending around $2 billion (1.6 billion pounds) on reconstruction and rehabilitation, according to the Indian embassy in Kabul. Over the past few years India has helped Afghanistan build roads, erect power transmission lines and construct a parliament building. Kabul has not yet responded to Trump’s comments. Afghanistan’s national security advisor, Hamdullah Mohib, is meeting his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval and other officials in New Delhi on Friday. “Trump mocked India, a key U.S. non-NATO partner that’s done major development work in Afghanistan, for building a library there,” Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at the Washington-based Wilson Center think-tank, said on Twitter. “Sigh.”",0
" Indonesia will temporarily stop sending students to universities in Taiwan, the foreign ministry said on Friday, after it asked Taipei to investigate media reports that up to 300 students were being forced to work in factories. The Southeast Asian nation sends students to Taiwan under a work-study programme that allows them to do internships while studying. Officials said students under this scheme had “faced problems”, without providing details. “We have asked for an explanation...and for authorities to take steps needed to protect the interests and safety of these students,” Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said in a statement. Taiwan’s education ministry said in a statement on Thursday the media reports were not accurate and that it found no violations of local labour laws after speaking to the students. If any illegal practice was found in any school, the ministry would suspend the programmes there, it added. A Taiwanese lawmaker, Ko Chih-en, said last week that six universities had been “forcing” their Southeast Asian students, especially Indonesians, to work long hours in factories making contact lenses, according to Taiwan News website. Reuters was not able to independently verify the accusation. There are around 6,000 Indonesian university students in Taiwan, around 1,000 of whom were sent under the work-study scheme, Nasir said.",0
" Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate and incoming U.S. senator from Utah, sharply criticized President Donald Trump and suggested the U.S. leader had caused dismay around the world. In a Washington Post essay published on Tuesday evening, Romney criticized a number of Trump’s actions in December. “The appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs all defined his presidency down,” he wrote. He added that “Trump’s words and actions have caused dismay around the world.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Romney suggested that “on balance, (Trump’s) conduct over the past two years ... is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.” Romney is staking out an independent position two days before he takes office on Thursday. It is unclear whether Trump will face a serious challenge in 2020 to securing the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. Trump last February endorsed Romney’s run for a Senate seat in Utah. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump as a “fraud” who was “playing the American public for suckers.” Trump responded that Romney had “choked like a dog” in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign against Democratic President Barack Obama. Despite Romney’s prior criticism, after Trump won the presidency in November 2016, he briefly considered tapping Romney as secretary of state. In his essay on Tuesday, Romney said he “will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.” Romney has strongly defended press freedom and challenged Trump’s repeated attacks on some news outlets as an “enemy of the people.” “The media is essential to our Republic, to our freedom, to the cause of freedom abroad, and to our national security. It is very much our friend,” Romney wrote in an essay in November.",0
" Western powers on Tuesday condemned election day violence in Bangladesh and described a range of other irregularities that marred a vote in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s alliance secured more than 90 percent of parliamentary seats. The strongly-worded assessments from the UK, European Union, and United States could hit the image of Hasina, who won a third straight term to power following Sunday’s election. Hasina’s opponents have rejected the election result, citing what they describe as widespread rigging and voter intimidation. She has denied impropriety, calling it a peaceful vote that saw enthusiastic participation from her supporters. The capital Dhaka was quiet on Tuesday, but the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said its workers were being attacked in several areas elsewhere in the country by activists of the Awami League - charges the party denied. “Violence has marred the election day, and significant obstacles to a level playing field remained in place throughout the process and have tainted the electoral campaign and the vote,” the EU said in a statement, calling for “a proper examination of allegations of irregularities”. The United States, Bangladesh’s largest foreign investor, expressed concern about “credible reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence in the pre-election period that made it difficult for many opposition candidates and their supporters to meet, hold rallies, and campaign freely.” “We are also concerned that election-day irregularities prevented some people from voting, which undermined faith in the electoral process,” it said. The UK’s Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field echoed the concerns, saying he was “aware of credible accounts of obstacles, including arrests, that constrained or prevented campaigning by opposition parties. “I urge a full, credible and transparent resolution of all complaints related to the conduct of the elections,” he said. Police say at least 17 people were killed in election day clashes between supporters and opponents of Hasina’s Awami League. The two sides, which have competed for power often violently for decades, traded blame for the election day unrest. Opposition BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam said he was collecting reports of rigging to submit to the Election Commission to demand a fresh vote. The commission already rejected that plea, but Islam said: “What is our alternative?” One journalist was arrested and another was on the run after a local government official filed a case against them for publishing “false information” about election irregularities, under a new law journalists say could be used to stifle dissent. Hedayet Hussain Mollah and Rashidul Islam published reports saying more votes had been cast at one constituency in the southeastern Khulna region than the total number of registered voters there. They were accused under the Digital Security Act enacted in September. Mollah was picked up by police on Tuesday afternoon while Islam was on the run, police said. “This is false information that was made intentionally to make the election result look questionable and controversial,” a police report said. The deadly clashes on voting day marked the end of a violent campaign. The opposition said its workers faced arbitrary arrests and candidates were attacked by ruling party activists. The ruling party denied being behind any violence. “People have shared experiences of being physically assaulted and manhandled at polling stations,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s regional campaigner for South Asia, calling for an impartial probe into incidents of violence. Hasina, whose father, state founder Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in a coup in 1975, has alternated in and out of power for nearly three decades with her main rival, BNP leader Zia Khaleda. Khaleda was jailed in February for corruption. Additional reporting by Enamul Haque in Khulna and Serajul Quadir in Dhaka; Editing by Peter Graff All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he intends to push forward towards a World War Two peace treaty with Russia, which has been stymied for decades by a territorial row, during a summit in Russia later this month. Abe, who has signalled he is keen to clinch a deal, will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in their 25th summit for discussions aimed at ending the disagreement over a group of windswept islands seized by Soviet troops in the final days of the war. “I’ll visit Russia later this month and intend to push forward with discussions towards a peace treaty,” he told a news conference in the western city of Ise. There had been “absolutely no progress” on the issue for more than 70 years, he said. Abe said that, while there were no guarantees of an agreement, the two nations had been cooperating over issues concerning the islands, as well as economically, over the past two years “as never before”. Putin caught Abe off guard in September when, on stage with the Japanese leader at a conference in Vladivostok, he suggested signing a peace treaty by year-end “without any pre-conditions”. Abe later rejected the proposal, repeating Japan’s stance that the question of sovereignty must be settled first. He told reporters after the two met again in Singapore in November they had agreed to speed up negotiations based on a 1956 joint statement in which Moscow agreed to transfer the two smaller islands to Japan after a peace treaty was concluded. “We both do not want this to drag out into another generation,” Abe said on Friday. Putin may be open to a deal now, expecting that better ties will act as a counter-balance to China and attract more Japanese investment and technology, some experts say. Others doubt Putin really wants any agreement, partly because a majority of the Russian public is opposed to returning any of the islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories and in Russia as the Southern Kurils.",0
" India’s Supreme Court will name a panel on Thursday to hear arguments over a controversial plan to build a Hindu temple on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque. A Hindu mob tore down the mosque in 1992, triggering communal riots that killed about 2,000 people across India. The site, in the northern town of Ayodhya, has been the focus of dispute between majority Hindus and minority Muslims for many years. Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who fixed the date for setting up the panel, did not give details. Building the temple is a key demand of the conservative Hindu allies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has gained fresh impetus ahead of a general election due by May. Both Hindu and Muslim communities have petitioned the Supreme Court, which has taken control of the site, to resolve the dispute. The allies of the BJP, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, its parent, have asked the government to introduce legislation to allow the temple to be built, bypassing any Supreme Court ruling. Hindu groups believe the site to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the religion’s most revered deities. Asked about the issue, Modi told Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday that the judicial process should take its course. A day later, Alok Kumar, an official of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Council, responded that Hindus were getting impatient because the case had been pending for a long time. Over the past three decades, the group has spearheaded a campaign to build the temple. In the past few months, it has organised rallies of tens of thousands of activists, monks and other supporters, in support.

" When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year speech to highlight coal as a “primary front” in developing the economy, he was making a case for what analysts see as a flawed but key resource on which his country increasingly relies. Coal has long been a major resource for North Korea, and Kim’s call for self sufficiency in the face of international pressure is a recurring theme. But as international sanctions have increased over the past year, coal is one of the few local resources to which Kim can turn as he tries to make good on promises to improve life in a country notorious for limited electricity, analysts and defectors say. Last year Kim declared that his nuclear arsenal was “complete” and vowed to focus on building the economy. South Korea-based analysts and North Korean defectors report that with sanctions still blocking most coal exports, the North has put more of its stockpile to use domestically. “My acquaintances in North Hamgyong province told me... they got power for 14-15 hours a day in 2018, versus 8-10 hours in 2017,” said Kim Young Hui, a defector who now works as an economist at South Korea’s state-run Korea Development Bank. A “highly noticeable” increase in electricity in 2018 compared to the year before has increased power availability for many homes and boosted the operations of factories and trains, said Kang Mi-jin, a defector who now writes about North Korea for the website Daily NK and speaks to sources inside the North. “As Kim Jong Un said in the New Year speech, North Korea will focus on the domestic economy,” she said. “Instead of finding another route to sell coal, they will continue to use it domestically.” But the ageing technology is limited in how much it can contribute to the broader economy, analysts said. “Focussing on coal and electricity is a way to survive, and Kim Jong Un is trying hard to make the country a bit more self-sufficient, but (coal is) not enough to turn around the whole economy as long as exports are capped,” economist Kim Young Hui said. In the New Year speech, Kim Jong Un called for the coal industry to focus on helping power stations “normalise electricity generation without letup.” He noted that output at the country’s largest coal power plant in Pukchang had increased “remarkably” and called for more progress on a “far-reaching plan” to develop tidal, wind and atomic power. Politically and economically isolated and repressed under Kim’s authoritarian regime, North Korea has long suffered from electricity shortages. In recent years, the lack of a reliable power supply led many North Koreans to install cheap household solar panels to charge mobile phones and light their homes. During a reporting trip to Pyongyang in September, multiple North Korean sources told Reuters that more electricity could help make some of Kim’s most prized building projects usable. At some recently constructed high-rise apartment buildings, for example, potential residents fear facing dozens of flights of stairs during power outages. Electricity in North Korea is prioritised for factories or areas of political importance, but people with money or connections are often able to tap power lines illegally. A source who regularly speaks to Pyongyang residents told Reuters that pre-ordering coal for boilers was no longer necessary because it had become more abundant. “People had to book coal early, about two months before running boilers when the weather gets chilly. But thanks to reduced coal exports, it is not hard to buy it anymore after last year. Sanctions have been tougher, but North Koreans can buy coal whenever they want if they have money,” the source said. North Korea generates nearly 50 percent of its electricity from seven coal power plants and one oil-fired plant, and the rest from hydroelectric facilities. Many of its decades-old coal plants were built by the former Soviet Union and China, according to South Korean data. Since 2015 North Korea has been working to convert the oil power plant to coal, according to U.S.-based monitoring group 38 North. In the last year it has added generators to the biggest coal power complex and built a new hydro power plant. A 1994 deal for an international consortium to provide two light-water reactors to North Korea in exchange for its ending some of its weapons-related operations fell through. Since then, the country has been working on an experimental light water reactor. Coal exports to China fell to 4.83 million tonnes in 2017, from more than 20 million tonnes in 2016, according to Chinese data. China says it imported no North Korean coal from January to March 2018. North Korea’s coal production rose from 2013 to 2016, but fell 30 percent to 21.66 million tonnes in 2017 from 2016, according to South Korean government data. Reliable data on North Korea’s reserves is hard to come by, but 2015 BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy reported that North Korea has 600 million tonnes of coal as proven reserves, while South Korea says the North has 20.5 billion tonnes in reserve. North Korea is known to have 4.5 billion tonnes of anthracite, a higher quality of coal, and the rest is lignite, which is mainly suitable for power plants. The North mostly exports anthracite, according to South Korean government data. North Korea has tried unsuccessfully to circumvent sanctions by smuggling coal into China and South Korea, monitors say. “Smuggling coal into China is not easy these days as even bribes for Chinese traders have become more expensive,” said Choi Kyung-soo, head of the North Korea Resources Institute.

" Democrats wasted no time flexing their new power in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday by approving legislation backed by new Speaker Nancy Pelosi that would end a 13-day partial government shutdown, ignoring President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) for a border wall. The White House on Thursday issued a veto threat against both parts of the Democratic legislation. But that did not deter House Democrats. Thursday marked the first day of divided government in Washington since Trump took office in January 2017, as Democrats took control in the House from his fellow Republicans, who remain in charge of the Senate. The 2019-2020 Congress convened with roughly a quarter of the federal government closed, affecting 800,000 employees, in a shutdown triggered by Trump’s demand last month for the money for a U.S.-Mexican border wall - opposed by Democrats - as part of any legislation funding government agencies. The House earlier on Thursday had formally picked Pelosi, a veteran Democratic lawmaker and liberal from San Francisco, as its speaker, beginning her second stint in one of Washington’s most powerful jobs. She is the only woman ever to serve as speaker and will preside over the most diverse U.S. House in history, including a record number of women and Latinos. The two-part Democratic package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8, providing $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras. The second part would fund the other federal agencies that are now unfunded including the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, Commerce and Justice, through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. “We’re not doing a wall. It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It’s an old way of thinking. It isn’t cost effective,” Pelosi told reporters late on Thursday. As speaker, Pelosi now is situated to lead Democratic opposition to Trump’s agenda and carry out investigations of his administration following two years during which congressional Republicans largely acquiesced to the president. Trump on Thursday made an unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room to make the case for the border wall, accompanied by members of a union that represents border patrol agents that endorsed him for president in 2016. He congratulated Pelosi on her selection as speaker and said: “Hopefully we’re going to work together.” “The wall - you can call it a barrier, you can call it whatever you want - but essentially we need protection in our country,” Trump told reporters, without taking questions. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signalled that the Democratic legislation had no future in the Senate, calling it “political theatre, not productive lawmaking.” “Let’s not waste the time,” he said on the Senate floor. “Let’s not get off on the wrong foot with House Democrats using their platform to produce political statements rather than serious solutions.” McConnell said the Senate would not take up any proposal that did not have a real chance of getting Trump’s signature. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged McConnell to allow the Democratic legislation to come to a vote in the chamber and said there was no reason to keep parts of the government unrelated to the border security issue shut down because of the wall standoff. “If Leader McConnell tonight would put the bill that’s passing the House on the floor, it would pass,” Schumer said, noting that the measures previously had been backed by Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties held unproductive talks with Trump at the White House on Wednesday and are to return for another round on Friday, a sign the shutdown is likely to continue at least for the rest of the week. After the November congressional elections, Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate and Democrats have a 235-199 margin in the House, with one seat undecided. Trump made the wall - a project estimated to cost about $23 billion - a key campaign promise in 2016, saying Mexico would pay for it and arguing it is needed to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and mediaeval. Credit rating agency Moody’s said the shutdown would cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.",0
" China has warned the country’s pork industry that covering up cases of African swine fever is a crime, days after a dead pig was found on a Taiwanese beach prompting Taipei to claim Beijing was not sharing accurate information on the disease. China’s animal husbandry and veterinary affairs bureau is stepping up investigation and punishment of illegal activity in the pig industry, said a statement published on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website on Friday. Failing to report deaths and privately slaughtering and selling sick or dead pigs would be pursued under criminal law, it said, and compensation of 1,200 yuan (138.45 pounds) for each pig culled was sufficient incentive for farmers to report the disease. In the worst epidemic of the disease ever seen, China has confirmed about 100 cases of African swine fever across 23 provinces since August last year. The disease, for which there is neither cure nor vaccine, is deadly to pigs but does not harm people. But many experts believe it is even worse than has been reported, and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen urged Beijing last month to “not conceal” information about the disease. Tsai raised the issue again in a New Year’s speech after a dead pig was found on a beach on Taiwan’s Kinmen island, a half-hour ferry ride from the east coast of China. The pig has since been confirmed to have the African swine fever virus, while another dead pig was found on a nearby island on Friday, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported. “During our recent efforts to prevent an African swine fever epidemic, China’s government has never followed the relevant agreements and provided Taiwan with accurate, real-time reports about the epidemic situation,” she said. China has repeatedly said that the disease has been effectively dealt with and is under control. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment on Friday. The dead animals found on the Taiwanese islands have stoked fears that Taiwan’s pigs could soon become infected with the disease. Taiwan’s herd of 5.39 million pigs is tiny compared with China’s 700 million, but pork is the most popular meat in both places and domestic production in Taiwan reduces its need for imports of the staple meat.

" Ecuador’s President Lenin Moreno on Thursday asked the country’s prosecutor to probe $4.9 billion (3.9 billion pounds) of oil-related infrastructure projects, alleging that the OPEC nation’s money was looted during the decade-long tenure of his leftist predecessor. Moreno said there were massive cost overruns, operational failings and non-transparent bidding processes at the five projects built during Rafael Correa’s presidency, including a $2.2 billion upgrade to the Esmeraldas refinery. “Nearly $5 billion of Ecuadoreans’ money, when it should have cost half that,” Moreno said in a national broadcast. “This theft of public funds cannot go unpunished.” Moreno took office in May 2017 after earning Correa’s endorsement during the campaign, but the two later fell out over Moreno’s market-friendly policies. Last year, Moreno asked a United Nations unit to conduct a technical and economic review of the five projects undertaken by the previous administration. Correa has denied allegations of corruption in his administration, calling them a political smear campaign. He lives in Belgium and has not returned to Ecuador since a judge last year ordered that he be jailed as part of a case involving the kidnapping of a lawmaker, in which he denies involvement. The other projects Moreno mentioned included a natural gas liquefaction plant, a seaport, a fuel distribution centre, a pipeline and a partly-built refinery that has run out of financing after receiving some $1.5 billion in investment.",0
" President Donald Trump’s pick to serve as U.S. attorney general, William Barr, got his nomination off to an awkward start by telling lawmakers he did not register for the military draft during the Vietnam War, before saying on Thursday that he had in fact signed up. Barr, who previously served as attorney general under President George H. W. Bush, told the Senate Judiciary Committee he had incorrectly described his draft record in biographical materials he submitted ahead of his confirmation hearings. “I have not served in the U.S. Military. I was born in 1950 and was not required to register for selective service,” he wrote on a questionnaire released by the committee. Historians said Barr would have been required to register for possible military service when he turned 18, a time when the government was drafting roughly 300,000 people per year to serve in Vietnam. Barr changed his position after being asked by Reuters why he had not registered. “I registered for the selective service at 18, as required, and was subject to the draft,” Barr wrote on Thursday in a letter to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, the new chairman of the committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat. Men who do not register for the draft face fines of up to $250,000 and a prison term of up to five years. They also are barred from most federal jobs, according to the Selective Service System, which registers men for possible compulsory service. “I can’t imagine a scenario in which (Barr) would not have been required to register,” Kansas University history professor Beth Bailey said. Barr, 68, said he initially told lawmakers he had not registered because he is now too old for compulsory military service. He will have a chance to explain the mix-up when he appears before the Judiciary Committee for confirmation hearings on January 15 and 16. Many prominent U.S. politicians — including Trump — have struggled to explain why they did not serve in the Vietnam War, which bitterly divided the United States. At Barr’s confirmation hearings, Democrats are expected to question him about his willingness to protect the independence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible ties between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Barr criticized Mueller’s conduct of the probe in a lengthy memo submitted to the Justice Department last year, prompting Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer last month to call on Trump to find a new nominee for attorney general. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said last month that Barr’s memo has had no impact on Mueller’s investigation. The investigation has secured more than 30 indictments and guilty pleas, and has spawned at least four federal probes. Trump has repeatedly criticized it as a “witch hunt.” If confirmed by the Senate, Barr would take over from Matthew Whitaker, who has been serving in an acting capacity since Trump forced out Jeff Sessions in November. Whitaker had been Sessions’ chief of staff.",0
" In just over a decade, South Korea has spent the equivalent of a small European economy trying to fix its demographic crisis, yet birthrates have dropped to the lowest in the world. This year, President Moon Jae-In, who describes himself as a feminist president, is testing a new angle: showing women more respect. At the end of last year, South Korea announced plans to remove some of the disincentives for employing women, allowing both parents to take parental leave at the same time and extending paid paternal leave. Employers also get incentives to allow either parent to work fewer hours. “Efforts on gender equality are very timely,” said Shin Eun-kyung, an economist with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. South Korea is the worst place for women to work in the OECD, despite women being among the organisation’s best educated, and more highly so than men. But the measures go beyond the workplace: mothers can choose to give the baby their own last name and a tickbox on birth certificates showing whether a baby was born outside marriage will be removed. Fertility treatments will be offered to single women and unmarried couples as well. Social campaigns will encourage men to participate more in child care and household chores. Contrast that with a 2016 effort by the previous government, run by the country’s first woman president, Park Geun-hye, which launched a website carrying a real-time statistical heatmap of women of child-bearing age, marriages and births in the hope of spurring competition between cities and regions. The website was taken down after one day, with women complaining it made them feel like “reproductive organs”. “The country sees women as baby factories,” says Hong Sook-young, who produces the country’s most popular children TV show. Asked about the latest measures, Hong said “at least pretending to hear what people really want is a start towards change”. For a graphic on South Korea birth rates versus the world, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RfZDEo South Korea’s demographic time bomb is ticking louder. The government’s latest forecast sees its population declining from 2027, and a presidential committee said the country’s economic growth potential could fall to below 1 percent. Birth rates have long been a policy priority: since 2006, the government has spent 152.9 trillion won (107.4 billion pounds) - about the size of an economy like Hungary or Nevada - on perks for families and subsidies for children from birth through university and beyond. Last year’s 26.3 trillion low birth policy budget was more than half the defence spending of a country technically still at war with its northern neighbour. But demographic experts say money is not the main issue: the experience of advanced countries with higher birth rates, such as France or Sweden, shows gender equality plays a crucial role. The previous allocation of resources drew criticism as well. The government went far beyond child allowances and subsidizing care and education. For instance, it funded temple stays for family bonding and financed youth seeking brief jobs abroad. Many such programs will end, with the 2019 birth-support budget cut by a quarter, to 20.5 trillion won. “It should have been cut a long time ago,” said Jung Jae-hoon, social welfare professor at Seoul Women’s University. Jung cautioned, however, the signal the government was finally sending will take a long time to filter through the conservative east Asian society. Births outside marriage, for instance, are so widely frowned upon that they amount to only 1.9 percent of the total, the lowest anywhere. Experts compare that to France, where the ratio is over 50 percent and the birth rate is 1.9 versus South Korea’s 1.05. Abortion is illegal and adoption rules very strict. The stigma of out-of-wedlock babies has seen Seoul’s Jusarang Community Church build an oven-sized “baby box”, with cushions and a heating system into its outside wall. Last year, 261 children were abandoned across the country, according to Statistics Korea. About 56 percent of women aged 15-64 work in South Korea, below the OECD average of almost 60 percent, and 72-75 percent in Denmark and Sweden, where birth rates are among the highest of advanced economies. Recruiters say married young women are less likely to get job opportunities due to discrimination. In November, the Supreme Court upheld a four-year jail sentence against a former CEO of state-run Korea Gas Safety Corp over manipulating interview scores to knock women out of the hiring process. While Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has a more balanced gender ratio than Apple APPL.O globally, with women accounting for 45 percent of the staff versus a third at its U.S. rival, only one in four staff at its Korea headquarters are women. None of the nine board members at Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) are women, versus six out of 12 at General Motors (GM.N). “The whole period of before, during and after childbirth weighs on our career,” said a female assistant manager at Hyundai Motor. The pay gap between sexes only makes it harder, she added. South Korea’s gender wage gap is highest among advanced countries at 34.6 percent, above OECD average of 13.8 percent. A Hyundai Motor spokeswoman said the firm was committed to providing equal opportunities to all employees and opposes discrimination. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said the company has been recruiting more females, including in managerial positions, and that most staff return to work after parental leave and its day care centres can look after 3,000 children. Still, critics say while Moon’s approach to birth rates is an improvement, his job and housing policies discourage parenthood. Minimum wage hikes have led to higher unemployment, while larger downpayment requirements have made homes unaffordable for many. “Creating a structure that enables us to have our own house is mostly needed,” said Lee Kyoung-min, a store manager at Lotte Mart, a father of three. Some also argue work-life balance could be better: Moon in July cut the working week to 52 hours from 68, but South Koreans still work 15 percent longer than the OECD average. If birth rates don’t improve, South Korea’s economy could be 5 percent smaller by 2060, as productivity falls and higher spending for elderly care leaves less room for investment, the National Assembly Budget Office estimates. Industries catering for babies are struggling. Seoul has lost one in four maternity wards and in 2018 the capital sacked more than half its teachers. Ryu Won-woo, manager of baby fair organizer BeFe, praised the government’s measures, especially those encouraging more responsibilities for dads. But he does not expect quick results. “More local baby-product companies may disappear before Korea sees more babies,” Ryu said.",0
" U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday sent a letter to President Donald Trump inviting him to deliver the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Jan. 29. Pelosi, a Democrat, sent the letter to the Republican president hours after being elected speaker of the House as the U.S. government was in the 13th day of a partial shutdown over Trump’s demand for $5 billion for a border wall. “In the spirit of our Constitution, I invite you to deliver your State of the Union address before a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, January 29, 2019 in the House Chamber,” Pelosi said in the letter. “I look forward to welcoming you to the Congress.”",0
" Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is expected to announce in the next few days that it has poached media finance veteran Spencer Neumann from Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) to be its chief financial officer, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Neumann will start at Netflix in early 2019, the source said. Earlier on Monday, Activision Blizzard said in a regulatory filing that it intended to fire Neumann for an unspecified reason. Neumann has served in a variety of finance roles including at Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). He replaces David Wells, who in August said he planned to step down after 14 years at the streaming media giant. The source said Netflix, which is making more of its own films and series, would like its next CFO to be based in Los Angeles with a focus on production finance. Wells is based northern California. Activision in its regulatory filing said that it intended to terminate Neumann “for cause unrelated to the company’s financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures.” It said that Neumann had been placed on paid leave.",0

" At least eight people were injured, one seriously, when a vehicle ploughed into crowds celebrating New Year’s Day in Tokyo early on Tuesday. A police spokesman said the driver had been detained and national broadcaster NHK said the man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He was identified as Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, from Osaka, a major city about 400 km (250 miles) southwest of Tokyo, NHK said. NHK said the suspect had initially described the incident as an “act of terror” but later said the attack was in retaliation for capital punishment. The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in the popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo. “I can’t believe it, this is a place I’m familiar with, so it’s very shocking,” said Tatsuhiro Yaegashi, a 27-year-old worker in the area. The street was closed to vehicles at the time of the incident to accommodate the large number of pedestrians making their way to the shrine for New Year’s prayers. TV pictures of the scene on Tuesday showed a grey coloured light vehicle used in the attack, positioned across the street. The front of the vehicle was badly damaged and dozens of police and rescue officials were at the scene. The suspect fled from the scene and assaulted a passerby before he was captured 20 minutes later, NHK said. About 20 litres of kerosene were found in the vehicle. “I learned about the incident later. But I shudder to think. If the incident had happened five minutes later, I would’ve been involved,” a woman who walked past the scene shortly after the incident told NHK. In a similar attack in 2008, a man who said he was tired of life drove a rental truck into a crowd of pedestrians in Tokyo before jumping out and stabbing several people. At least seven people were killed and a dozen injured.",0
" A North Korean diplomat who was until recently acting ambassador to Italy has gone missing, a South Korean member of parliament said on Thursday, after a South Korean newspaper reported he was seeking asylum in the West. The diplomat, 48-year-old Jo Song Gil, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in early November, according to Kim Min-ki, a South Korean lawmaker who was briefed by the National Intelligence Service. Earlier on Thursday, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing an unidentified diplomatic source, said Jo had applied for asylum to an unspecified Western country and was in a “safe place” with his family under the protection of the Italian government. A senior diplomatic source in Rome said Italy’s foreign ministry knew nothing about the reports. A second diplomatic source said the ministry had no record of Jo seeking asylum in Italy. The source added that North Korea had announced in late 2018 that it was sending a new envoy to Rome. “It was a perfectly normal procedure,” the source said. Kim told reporters he had some information about the case but could not discuss it. “They left the diplomatic mission and vanished,” Kim said, referring to Jo and his family. If confirmed, Jo would join a slowly growing list of senior diplomats who have sought to flee the impoverished, oppressive North under the rule of Kim Jong Un. In August 2016 Thae Yong Ho, the North’s then deputy ambassador to Britain, defected with his family to South Korea, becoming the highest-ranking diplomat to do so. Thae said on Thursday Jo, whose father was a diplomat, came from wealthy family, reported South Korean cable news Channel A. Although Jo’s father died early, Thae worked with his father-in-law, Ri To Sop, who was also a diplomat at the foreign ministry. Ri was in charge of protocol for events attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s father and grandfather. Jo lived in the “nicest apartment” in Pyongyang and his wife also graduated from a medical school in the capital, Thae said. The last time Thae saw Jo, before he was stationed in Britain in 2013, he had one child and he understands he brought that child with him when he was dispatched to Italy. He added Jo studied in Italy from 2006 to 2009 and it was highly possible he was involved in smuggling luxury goods for the North Korean elite, a key task for diplomats there. Jo took up the acting envoy post in October 2017 after Italy expelled then-ambassador Mun Jong Nam in protest over North Korea’s nuclear and long-range missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. Jo’s stint began in May 2015 and was due at the end of November, lawmaker Kim said. A source familiar with the matter, who asked to remain unnamed in order to speak about a sensitive political issue, told Reuters that Jo was officially replaced as acting ambassador by Kim Chon in late November. The source could not confirm the JoongAng Ilbo report or whether Jo was still based in Italy. South Korea’s presidential Blue House said earlier on Thursday it had no knowledge of the matter. Italy said in a report it submitted to a U.N. panel monitoring the enforcement of sanctions in November 2017 that four diplomats were stationed at the North Korean embassy there, listing the acting envoy as first secretary. The JoongAng Ilbo said Jo was with his wife and children. Citing an unidentified expert, it said he was known to be the son or son-in-law of a top-ranking North Korean official. North Korea forced diplomats stationed overseas to leave children at home after Kim took power in late 2011. Thae, the former deputy ambassador to Britain, said in his 2018 memoir that was the main reason behind his defection, calling it a “hostage” scheme. However, Thae also wrote there were some exceptions for those from the top echelons and who were seen as the most loyal to Kim.",0
" Brazil’s new President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday that he would be open to the possibility of the United States operating a military base on his country’s soil, a move that would form a sharp shift in direction for Brazilian foreign policy. Bolsonaro, who took power on Tuesday, said that Russia’s support of President Nicolas Maduro’s “dictatorship” in neighbouring Venezuela had significantly ramped up tensions in the region and was a worrying development. Asked by the SBT TV network in an interview taped on Thursday if that meant he would allow U.S. military presence in Brazil, Bolsonaro responded that he would certainly be willing to negotiate that possibility. “Depending on what happens in the world, who knows if we would not need to discuss that question in the future,” Bolsonaro said. He emphasized that what Brazil seeks is to have “supremacy here in South America.” The far-right leader is upending foreign policy dating back over a decade, which saw the leftist Workers Party emphasizing South-South relations and sometimes tussling on the international stage with the United States. Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former Army captain and admirer of both Brazil’s 1964 to 1985 military dictatorship and U.S. President Donald Trump, has quickly deepened ties with the Unites States and Israel. Bolsonaro’s national security adviser, retired Army General Augusto Heleno, confirmed earlier on Thursday that the president wants to move Brazil’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, but that logistical considerations were standing in the way. Heleno did not elaborate. But the country’s powerful agriculture sector is opposed to moving the embassy from Tel Aviv and angering Arab nations that buy billions of dollars worth of Brazilian halal or “permissible” meat each year. Benjamin Netanyahu became the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Brazil this week when he attended Bolsonaro’s inauguration. After a private meeting, Netanyahu said that Bolsonaro told him that moving the embassy was a matter of “when, not if.” Heleno said on Thursday, “there is a clear desire that this happens, but there has been no decision on a date.” He said he did not think exports would be threatened, arguing that Brazilian diplomats would work with Middle Eastern trading partners to ease concerns. Bolsonaro and some state governors in Brazil are looking to purchase drones and lean on the United States and Israel for other technology and know-how as they seek to dismantle powerful and heavily armed drug cartels. Separately, Bolsonaro met with the head of the World Trade Organisation, Roberto Azevedo, who said the government’s sharp rebukes of globalism were shared by many other countries and that the trade body was making changes. On Wednesday, Brazil’s new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo said that under his watch the country would fight for change at multilateral institutions like the WTO. Araujo’s words were not a threat, Azevedo said. “To the contrary, I think it was very propitious and compatible with what is happening,” he said after meeting Bolsonaro. “The World Trade Organisation itself is beginning the process of reforms.” On the domestic front, Onyx Lorenzoni, Bolsonaro’s chief of staff, said after a first full meeting of the cabinet that the new administration was committed to an ambitious pension overhaul, and that a privatisation programme was still under evaluation. By early next week each minister should announce their top priority, Lorenzoni said. Bolsonaro’s economic team has promised to liberalize Brazil’s hidebound economy, rid the country of “socialism,” and enact conservative social measures in areas like education. On Wednesday, Bolsonaro unveiled plans to step up privatisations, toughen prison sentencing guidelines and hand control over indigenous land claims to the powerful Agriculture Ministry. Brazilian markets soared on promises to shrink government. Bolsonaro’s administration is made up of free market economists, statist former military generals, and religious ideologues, and it remains to be seen just how committed he is to liberalizing the economy. Nonetheless, Bolsonaro tweeted on Thursday morning that privatisation of 12 Brazilian airports and four ports should attract 7 billion reais (1.48 billion pounds) in initial investment. He did not give further details.",0
" Clashes among rival Syrian rebel factions have spread across northwest Syria, rebels and residents said on Thursday, in the latest bout of tit-for-tat fighting between opponents of President Bashar al Assad’s rule. Infighting has long plagued Syria’s armed opposition since the uprising against Assad began in 2011. Turf wars have helped the Syrian president, with his Iranian and Russian allies, recover much of the territory previously held by rebels. Tahrir al Sham, formerly affiliated to al Qaeda, had launched an attack on Tuesday against towns in the western countryside of Aleppo held by Nour al Din Zinki, a member of the mainstream National Liberation Front (NLF), the rebels and residents told Reuters by telephone. The Islamist group, which on Wednesday seized the town of Darat Izza, said it was retaliating for an ambush this week that killed five of its fighters. It blamed Nour al Din Zinki. Ideological differences divide hardline Islamist militants from nationalist groups in the Free Syrian Army that have gathered under the banner of the NLF, which has the backing of Syria’s neighbour Turkey. A rebel source said capturing the town of Darat Izza would strengthen the Islamist group in secret talks with Turkey, which has a military foothold in the northern region and wants to tighten its grip on the area to secure its border. The militant Islamists’ goal was to create a contiguous stretch of territory from areas they control north of Idlib near the Turkish border to strongholds in the Aleppo countryside, said a senior Western diplomat closely following Syria who requested anonymity. In a further bout of tit-for-tat fighting, NLF forces who sent more deployments and announced a call for war, attacked Tahrir al Sham strongholds and checkpoints in Idlib province, residents and rebels said. “We hold Tahrir al Sham responsible for the dangerous and catastrophic repercussions that result from its escalation and call on its wise men to stop the fighting and preserve what is left of the revolution,” the NLF said in statement. Residents say the NLF has made little progress in dislodging the Islamists from Saraqeb, one of the main cities they hold in Idlib province. Fears however grew that fighting that has mostly avoided civilian areas could spill over into heavily populated urban areas. Dozens have so far been killed and wounded, rebels said. Although the Islamists are outnumbered by the mainstream NLF, they are the most powerful group in Idlib and have de facto control over most of the province, the last big rebel enclave. Scores of civilians in Maarat al Numan, an NLF-controlled town, held a rally against Tahrir al Sham on Wednesday, accusing the group and its leader Sheikh Abu Mohammad al Golani of serving Assad by launching its latest attack. Clashes between rebel factions have extended to Atma, a town on Idlib province’s northern border with Turkey. The town is now home to tens of thousands of Syrians displaced by the years of conflict and who now live in makeshift tents. One resident in the camp, Abdul Aziz Younis, told Reuters several civilians were killed when rebels shelled each other as hundreds of families fled to safer places.",0
" Survivors and lawyers demanded on Thursday the Catholic Church make public the names of 500 priests or clergy members in Illinois accused of child sexual abuse, in the latest outcry of a global crisis. They spoke out two weeks after Illinois state Attorney General Lisa Madigan issued a blistering report stating alleged abusers had not been publicly identified by the Church and many had not been properly investigated. “We’re here to fight for the 500 that have been identified as the number of clergy offenders who the Catholic bishops ... in Illinois know about who have not disclosed,” attorney Jeff Anderson said at a news conference standing alongside survivors. Anderson said he and his colleagues will issue a report by next month that identifies every clergy offender accused of child sexual abuse who was brought to their attention. Children cannot be protected unless the names are provided to police and the general public, Anderson said. Knowing the names of the accused priests would also help victims who have not come forward, survivor Ken Kaczmarz said. “If the priest that molested them is on a published list, those people that are currently suffering in silence will, I guarantee you, have the courage to seek help,” he said. The Illinois dioceses of Rockford, Joliet and Belleville on Thursday stood by lists published on their websites of priests with substantiated allegations of sexual abuse of a minor and of clergy removed from ministry. Representatives of the other three dioceses in Illinois did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Madigan, who opened her investigation in August and leaves office later this month, said the 500 priests and clergy members her office had identified were in addition to 185 publicly named by the six dioceses. Facing accusations of sexual abuse and coverups by priests around the world, Pope Francis on Thursday accused U.S. bishops of failing to show unity in the face of the crisis. Survivors gathered in downtown Chicago on Thursday as U.S. bishops met near the city for seven days of prayer and spiritual reflection ahead of a gathering at the Vatican in February to confront the global abuse crisis. “There has to be more than 500. That’s just the start. We need a comprehensive list in order for the Church to feel safe again,” Cynthia Yesko, a survivor and plaintiff of a lawsuit seeking the disclosure of the names of clergy offenders in Illinois, said.",0

" Guyana’s government will challenge in court a parliamentary no-confidence vote that toppled President David Granger’s ruling coalition amid a dispute over developing the country’s nascent oil industry, the country’s attorney general said on Thursday. The Dec. 21 vote triggered new elections within 90 days, after one lawmaker from Granger’s APNU-AFC coalition sided with the opposition, which accuses the government of mismanaging the country’s oil resources by granting Exxon Mobil overly generous contract terms. The government plans to argue that the motion needed 34 votes to pass, rather than the 33 it received, and that the lawmaker who cast the deciding vote was ineligible to be a member of parliament because he also holds Canadian citizenship, attorney general Basil Williams said. Williams told reporters that the government would first petition the South American country’s High Court, and if unsuccessful is prepared to appeal to Guyana’s Court of Appeal and the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), the judicial body of the Caricom group of nations. “We’re off to the CCJ,” Williams said. Guyana has no history of crude production but has in recent years become one of the world’s most closely watched basins after Exxon Mobil discovered more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas offshore. Commercial production is expected to begin in 2020, and output could reach 750,000 barrels per day. The day after the no-confidence vote, the navy of neighbouring Venezuela halted two boats hired by Exxon to conduct a seismic survey in the western portion of the Stabroek block. Both countries say the incident occurred in their territorial waters, reigniting a century-long border dispute. Granger, who returned to Guyana this week after undergoing chemotherapy in Cuba, plans to meet with opposition leader Bharrat Jagdeo of the People’s Progressive Party next week. Jagdeo has said Granger “sold our patrimony” to Exxon Mobil. The government has insisted that it got the best deal it could and is banking on new oil wealth to transform the economy of the English-speaking country of just 750,000.",0
" The Trump administration is considering Jim Webb, a former Democratic senator who also served as Navy secretary under Republican President Ronald Reagan, to be the next defence secretary, the New York Times reported on Thursday. Citing an unnamed official, the Times said Vice President Mike Pence and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had reached out to Webb. It said what it described as a senior Defence Department official confirmed Webb’s name had been circulating at the White House. Jim Mattis stepped down from his job as secretary of defence on Tuesday and President Donald Trump said a day later he had essentially fired Mattis, a retired Marine general whose letter of resignation was seen as a sharp rebuke to the Republican president. Mattis resigned after Trump’s surprise decisions to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria and half of the 14,000-strong contingent in Afghanistan. Trump has named Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing Co executive who was Mattis’s deputy, as acting defence secretary. The Times said Webb could potentially allow Trump to bypass “more hawkish Republicans whose names have been floated to replace Jim Mattis.” It said Republican senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham and former Republican Senator Jim Talent had also been mentioned as possible replacements for Mattis. The White House declined to comment on the Times report. The Times said Webb did not respond to a request for comment. Webb, 72, is a decorated war veteran who served in the Vietnam War, the author of 10 books and an Emmy award-making journalist and filmmaker. A former U.S. senator from Virginia, Webb ran a long-shot campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. “Americans don’t like the extremes to which both parties have moved in recent years and, quite frankly, neither do I,” he said in October 2015 when announcing he was dropping his bid.",0
" Democrat Nancy Pelosi was elected on Thursday to be the new speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives as her party took majority control of the chamber following its election victory last Nov. 6. This marks Pelosi’s second stint as speaker. She was the first woman ever to hold the job, serving from 2007 until 2011, when Republicans began an eight-year run in the House majority. Pelosi received 220 votes for speaker, while Republican Representative Kevin McCarthy got 192 votes. A smattering of others received the remaining votes in the chamber that holds 435 seats. The election puts Pelosi in position to lead the opposition to President Donald Trump’s agenda and to conduct in-depth investigations of his administration following two years during which Republicans have mainly given him a free pass. Pelosi, 78, was first elected to the House in 1987 and has pledged to push legislation that would spark large federal investments in infrastructure projects that Trump also has expressed an interest in tackling. But Pelosi’s Democrats and Trump’s Republicans have taken vastly different approaches to rebuilding the nation’s bridges, roadways, airports and other public works projects that also would spark job creation. During last year’s congressional campaigns Pelosi also talked about the need to improve Congress’ ethics rules and to pass legislation to lessen the influence of large corporate donations in congressional elections. Pelosi, a liberal who represents San Francisco, will lead a House with 235 Democrats, 199 Republicans and one seat in North Carolina still being contested. Besides her legislative agenda, Pelosi has made clear that the House’s Democratic-run committees will conduct in-depth oversight of Trump administration officials and likely would attempt to get the president’s recent tax returns as part of House investigations into his business dealings. Some of Pelosi’s Democrats already have hinted that these oversight investigations could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, depending on the findings of committee hearings and special counsel Robert Mueller’s separate findings from his investigation into the 2016 presidential election and Russian interference. As House speaker, Pelosi will set the legislative agenda for the House, is a leading figure in Democratic Party politics and is second in line for the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence if Trump were to become incapacitated. Republicans maintain control of the Senate by a margin of 53-47 for the next two years.",0
" Equities around the world rose on Monday as possible progress in resolving the trade dispute between the United States and China engendered some investor optimism in what has been a punishing end of year for markets. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index advanced in light trading volume after U.S. President Donald Trump said he held a “very good call” with China’s President Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade and said “big progress” was being made. Chinese state media were more reserved, saying Xi hoped the negotiating teams could meet each other halfway and reach an agreement that was mutually beneficial. The rise in U.S. equities mirrored that in Asian and European markets, which were also buoyed by trade optimism. Despite Monday’s advance, equities ended the year largely in the red, victims of investor anxiety over trade tensions and slowing economic growth. Asian and European shares had been sluggish for much of the year, and in recent months, U.S. stocks followed suit. “If the European economy continues to decelerate and the Chinese economy decelerates because of tariffs, there is definitely going to be spillover to the United States,” said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. The S&P 500 dropped more than 9 percent in December, its largest decline since the Great Depression. For the year, the index slid more than 6 percent, its biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 16 percent for the year, while the STOXX 600 was more than 13 percent lower. MSCI’s gauge of stocks around the globe .MIWD00000PUS fell 11.1 percent in 2018. A further blow to the Chinese economy could spur a quicker resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute and thus boost global equities, Saccocia said. Survey data on Monday showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in two years even as the service sector improved. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 265.06 points, or 1.15 percent, to 23,327.46, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.11 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,506.85 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 50.76 points, or 0.77 percent, to 6,635.28. MSCI’s emerging markets index .MSCIEF rose 0.32 percent, while the MSCI world stock index .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.66 percent. Global markets in 2018: tmsnrt.rs/2AmRgNB Yields on U.S. Treasuries fell on Monday, keeping with the trend over the past two months as investors moved to lower-risk investments. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 15/32 in price to yield 2.686 percent, compared with 2.738 percent late on Friday. The fall in Treasury yields reflects expectations of a slowdown, if not a pause altogether, in the Federal Reserve’s progression of interest-rate hikes. The precipitous drop in yields has undermined the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3 percent and on track to end December with a loss. It is, however, still set for its highest yearly percentage gain since 2015. On Monday, the dollar fell to a six-month low against the yen JPY=. The euro EUR= was up 0.2 percent to $1.1459, on track to end the year down nearly 5 percent against the dollar. Oil posted its first year of losses since 2015, with Brent crude futures LCOc1 down 19.5 percent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 down 24.8 percent. On Monday, Brent crude settled 59 cents higher, or 1.11 percent, at $53.80 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 8 cents, or 0.18 percent, at $45.41 a barrel.",0

" Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday rejected opposition complaints of vote rigging and said people had gone to the polls enthusiastically in a general election that her ruling alliance swept with a landslide. The victory consolidates Hasina’s decade-long rule in the South Asian nation, in which her government has overseen booming economic growth, but is accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent - charges her government denies. In a victory speech at her official residence in the capital Dhaka, Hasina, 71, touted robust support for her Awami League-led alliance, which won 287 of the 298 seats, while the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led alliance got six seats. “They voted so enthusiastically,” Hasina told a room full of journalists and foreign election observers. “What do people want? They want to fulfil their basic needs. When they feel that yes, only this government can ensure it, then definitely they will vote for us.” The opposition rejected the result and called for a fresh vote, complaining of what it said was widespread rigging. Neighbours India and China congratulated Hasina, and a visiting election monitoring group from South Asian countries said they had found nothing amiss in voting in the capital Dhaka. There was no immediate statement from the European Union or the United States, which had expressed concern last week over campaign violence it said had mostly impacted opposition candidates, and a delay in visas for many U.S.-funded observers who couldn’t make it into the country. At least 17 people were killed during Sunday’s poll that followed a violent election campaign in which both sides blamed the other for casualties. Candidates reported witnessing ballot-stuffing and vote-rigging by ruling party activists, who also barred opposition polling agents from voting centres, said opposition leader Kamal Hossain. “We’ve had bad elections in the past but I must say that it is unprecedented how bad this particular election was,” Hossain said. Bangladesh’s Election Commission said it was investigating allegations of vote rigging but rejected demands for another vote. Human Rights Watch expressed concern over the election’s credibility and Amnesty International called for an impartial probe into “deeply disturbing” election violence. “ONE-PARTY STATE” The opposition BNP alleged it was never granted a level playing field to campaign in the election, with thousands of its workers locked up on charges it termed as fictitious, and many candidates attacked by ruling party activists, crippling its campaign. The BNP had boycotted the last polls in 2014, not trusting Hasina to hold them fairly, and some BNP leaders said Sunday’s vote had proved them right. The BNP went to the vote for the first time without its leader Khaleda Zia – Hasina’s arch rival and a former prime minister – who was jailed in February on corruption charges she says were politically motivated. The rivalry between the two women has largely defined Bangladeshi politics for decades. Hasina on Sunday referred to the BNP as “terrorists”, saying the election had been “very peaceful” barring a few incidents in which workers for her party were killed. She said the Election Commission was independent and would investigate any allegations of rigging. Hasina, the longest-serving leader in the history of the Muslim-majority country of 165 million people, promised more development and an improved economy in her third straight term. Her adviser H.T. Imam said the government would consider raising the minimum wage for workers in its garment industry, which generates about 83 percent of exports and is the world’s second-largest only after China’s. “Certainly, the Awami League enjoys strong constituencies and has support and it can get votes, but for any party to win more than 90 percent of the seats is simply too suspicious,” said Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at the Washington-based Wilson Centre think-tank. “I fear that this election result signifies that Bangladesh has really become something very closely approximating a one-party state.”",0
" Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is eyeing a presidential run, blasted former Senator Joseph Lieberman for becoming a lobbyist for ZTE Corp, a Chinese telecommunications equipment maker accused of ties to China’s government. In a tweet posted on Wednesday night, Warren said Lieberman had “joined” lobbyists for ZTE, which she wrote had “violated serious U.S. sanctions” against Iran and North Korea. “Should that be legal? No,” she added, arguing in a subsequent tweet for a lifetime ban on lawmakers working as lobbyists. Lieberman, who ran unsuccessfully for vice president as a Democrat in 2000 and Kasowitz Benson Torres, the firm where he is a lobbyist, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But a lobby registration form released on Wednesday showed Lieberman was “retained to undertake an independent assessment of concerns that Members of Congress, Executive branch and American businesses have about any national security vulnerabilities and risks that ZTE products may pose in the US.” It added that Lieberman would not be lobbying for ZTE, saying he was registered “in the interest of transparency and caution.” The comments highlighted the politically charged debate in Washington about ZTE and Huawei Technologies Cos Ltd [HWT.UL], China’s biggest network equipment companies. The U.S. government says both companies work at the behest of China’s government and sell equipment capable of spying on Americans, charges both companies deny. In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill barring the federal government from using ZTE equipment. Reuters reported last week that Trump was considering an executive order this year to declare a national emergency, banning American companies from using ZTE and Huawei telecommunications gear. Warren’s tweets came days after the liberal from Massachusetts formed an exploratory committee that would allow her to begin raising money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic field for the 2020 presidential race.",0
" Three-quarters of French people are unhappy with the way President Emmanuel Macron and his government are running the country, with a majority keen to see more measures to boost household incomes, a poll showed on Thursday. A wave of “yellow vest” street protests in the past two months have rocked Macron’s presidency, forcing him into policy concessions including scrapping a planned fuel tax rise to try and defuse anger over a perceived squeeze on family budgets. Facing the sternest challenge of his 20-month tenure, Macron has since vowed to press on with other reform pledges, however, like tackling unemployment benefits or overhauling the civil service, even as the protest movement rumbles on. Only 25 percent of people surveyed by Odoxa and Dentsu Consulting for franceinfo and the Figaro newspaper said they were satisfied with the French government’s measures and action since Macron came to power in mid-2017. The poll of 1,004 people, carried out on Jan. 2 and 3, compared to one from April 2018, when 59 percent of those surveyed were unhappy with the government versus 75 percent now. The biggest political priority for 54 percent of French people was finding measures to boost purchasing power, the poll found, while reducing unemployment, long the number one worry, slipped to become the fourth most urgent concern. Support for the “yellow vest” demonstrations, which have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities, has also dwindled somewhat versus earlier surveys, and following Macron’s bid to meet some of the protesters’ demands. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed said they thought the protests should carry on, compared to 54 percent on Dec. 11 and 66 percent on Nov. 22 shortly after the movement erupted.",0
" The United States issued a pre-emptive warning to Iran on Thursday against pursuing three planned space rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology. Iran rejected the warning, issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, saying its space vehicle launches and missile tests were not violations. Pompeo said Iran planned to launch in the coming months three rockets, called Space Launch Vehicles (SLV), that he said incorporate technology “virtually identical” to what is used in intercontinental ballistic missiles. “The United States will not stand by and watch the Iranian regime’s destructive policies place international stability and security at risk,” Pompeo said in a statement. “We advise the regime to reconsider these provocative launches and cease all activities related to ballistic missiles in order to avoid deeper economic and diplomatic isolation.” Pompeo said the rocket launches would violate U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. It calls upon Iran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, but does not explicitly bar such activity. Iran has repeatedly rejected U.S. accusations about its ballistic missile tests, including the firing of space launchers. “Iran’s launch of space vehicles - & missile tests - are NOT in violation of (Resolution) 2231. The US is in material breach of same, & as such it is in no position to lecture anyone on it,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote in Twitter post on Thursday. “Threats engender threats, while civility begets civility.” Tehran denies it has missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads. Pompeo said Iran has launched ballistic missiles numerous times since the U.N. resolution was adopted. He said it test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple warheads on Dec. 1. President Donald Trump decided in May to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. Iranian Deputy Defence Minister General Qassem Taqizadeh in late November was quoted by Iranian media as saying that Iran would soon launch into space three satellites made by domestic experts. In July 2017, Iran launched a Simorgh (Phoenix) rocket it said could deliver a satellite into space, an act the U.S. State Department called provocative. Earlier that month, the United States imposed new economic sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile programme. Iran’s Amirkabir University of Technology said on Tuesday that it was putting the final touches to the Payam (Message) satellite, which it said was equipped with four cameras and could be used for agricultural, forestry and other peaceful purposes, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The satellite, weighing about 100 kg (220 pounds), is to be launched by a state-run space centre into an orbit of 500 km (300 miles) with a Simorgh, the ISNA news agency reported. Iranian media reports said the Payam launch may coincide with celebrations in early February marking the 40th anniversary of Iran’s Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah.",0
" A former U.S. Marine detained in Russia has been charged with espionage, the Interfax news agency said on Thursday, meaning he could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Russia’s FSB state security service detained Paul Whelan, 48, in Moscow last Friday on suspicion of spying, in a case which threatens to aggravate diplomatic tensions with the United States. The FSB opened a criminal case against Whelan but gave no details of his alleged espionage activities. Interfax said the Russian authorities had brought formal charges against Whelan on Thursday, citing what it described as an informed source. Reuters could not independently verify the Interfax report. Whelan’s lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, declined to comment on the charges but told Reuters that under the terms of the arrest order, Whelan was expected to remain in custody in Moscow until at least Feb. 28. “I consider his detention and arrest baseless. It’s based on investigators’ supposition that he will hinder the investigation process. We are asking for bail instead,” Zherebenkov told Reuters by telephone. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States had asked Russia to explain Whelan’s arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determines his detention is inappropriate. Whelan’s family has said that he was visiting Moscow for the wedding of a retired Marine and is innocent of the espionage charges against him. Under Russian law, espionage can carry sentences of between 10 and 20 years in prison. Zherebenkov said Whelan, who is being held at the Lefortovo detention facility in Moscow, was “feeling positive” and that a translator was explaining the legal procedures to him. “All his rights and all international principles are being fully followed,” Zherebenkov said. Russia’s relations with the United States plummeted when Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Washington and Western allies imposed sanctions on Russian officials, companies and banks. U.S. President Donald Trump’s relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have been under a microscope because of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied interfering in the election. Trump has said there was no collusion and says Mueller’s probe is a witch hunt. Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it was “possible, even likely” that Putin had ordered Whelan’s arrest to set up an exchange for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who pleaded guilty on Dec. 13 to acting as an agent to influence conservative groups in the United States. Russia says Butina was forced to make a false confession about being a Russian agent. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Whelan’s detention. Putin told Trump in a letter on Sunday that Moscow was ready for dialogue on a “wide-ranging agenda,” the Kremlin said, after a series of attempts to schedule a meeting between the leaders. At the end of November, Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting with Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina, citing tensions about Russian forces opening fire on Ukrainian navy boats and then seizing them.",0
" The United Nations said on Thursday it feared for the safety of Syrians barred from entering Algeria from the south, saying some of those turned back were refugees left stranded in the desert and not suspected militants as Algiers maintains. The official overseeing migrant policy at Algeria’s interior ministry said on Wednesday that Syrians who had arrived overland from the south recently were members of defeated militant groups from Syria’s civil war who would pose a security threat. But the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees criticised the decision, saying that some of the Syrians mentioned by the Algerian official were known to be registered refugees. “(They) have fled conflict and persecution or claim to have attempted to seek international protection in Algeria,” a UNHCR statement said.”According to information made available to UNHCR, 20 individuals from this group currently remain stranded in the desert, three kilometres from the Guezzam border post where they are exposed to the elements. The other 100 individuals who were taken to the border are unaccounted for,” the statement said. Citing an “urgent humanitarian imperative”, UNHCR said it had appealed to Algerian authorities for access to Syrians affected by the ban to identify those in need of international protection and ensure their safety. Hassen Kacimi, the interior ministry officials, said around 100 Syrians had reached the southern border with the help of local armed escorts in recent weeks but were intercepted and expelled shortly after they slipped into Algeria. He said these Syrians had transited Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan and Niger or Mali using fake Sudanese passports. Algeria has taken in around 50,000 Syrians on humanitarian grounds in recent years, Kacimi added. Algeria went through years of devastating civil war with Islamist militant groups in the 1990s. While violence is now greatly diminished, sporadic attacks continue in isolated areas. In Algeria’s south and southeast, largely desolate areas with few inhabitants, the government has beefed up its security presence after neighbouring Libya and northern Mali and Niger descended into lawlessness with various armed groups active.",0
" Two French scientists who validated Jeanne Calment’s status as the oldest person ever to have lived, have dismissed claims by Russian researchers who say that she didn’t really survive to 122. Mathematician Nikolay Zak and gerontologist Valery Novoselov claim that Calment’s daughter, Yvonne Calment, assumed her mother’s identity decades earlier. The Russians analyzed photographs, official documents and interviews to produce a body of evidence they acknowledge is circumstantial. Gerentology is the scientific study of old age. Jean-Marie Robine, one of the two French scientists who validated Calment’s age, told France Inter radio late on Wednesday that the stir being caused in France by the Russians’ findings was a “ridiculous controversy”. A spokesman for Guinness World Records, which registered Calment’s age as a world record, said they were aware of the Russians’ claims. “Extensive research is performed for every oldest person record title we verify, which is led by experts in the gerontology field and they have been notified of the current situation,” a spokesman said. In a paper for the Moscow Center For Continuous Mathematical Education, Zak cites discrepancies between the color of Jeanne Calment’s eyes, her height and the shape of her forehead in a copy of a 1930s identity card and in her appearance later in life. “I do not have cast-iron proof,” Zak told Reuters on a snow-blanketed street in Moscow. “I reviewed the whole situation. There are lots of small pieces of evidence.” The second French scientist who validated Calment’s age, gerontologist Michel Allard, acknowledged that even if far-fetched, the Russians’ conclusions should be given consideration, although he rejected their suggestions of discrepancies between early images of Calment and her appearance in later life. “In the last years of Jeanne Calment’s life, I saw so many transformations of her physiognomy,” he told France Inter. Jeanne Calment was born on Feb 21, 1875, more than a decade before the Eiffel Tower was built and a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone. She married a distant wealthy cousin and outlived her daughter Yvonne — who died of pneumonia in the early 1930s according to official documents — her husband and a grandson before passing away in Arles, southern France, on Aug 4, 1997.",0
" The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether President Donald Trump’s former Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, lied to Department of Interior investigators in what could be a potential criminal violation, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. The Post, citing three people familiar with the matter, said the former Cabinet official was the centre of two probes by his department’s inspector general: one involving his real estate transactions in Montana and another over his role in a review of a Connecticut casino project proposed by Native American tribes. Zinke left the administration on Wednesday but had made no public mention of the ethics investigations upon his departure from Interior, which oversees America’s vast public lands. Trump did not give a reason for the departure when he announced it last month. The people familiar with the matter said Interior investigators had referred the matter to the Department of Justice after coming to believe that Zinke had lied to them about his dealings, according to the Post. Representatives for Zinke could not be immediately reached for comment on the Post report. A spokesman for Zinke told the Post that the former secretary had not been contacted by the Justice Department, the Post said. Zinke had voluntarily been interviewed by Interior investigators regarding the casino, he also told the Post. “As a general matter, the department doesn’t confirm or deny the existence of any ongoing investigation,” Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said. The Post, citing people familiar with the matter, said Justice Department officials have not decided yet whether to charge Zinke. Zinke, a former Navy Seal and U.S. congressman, had served as Interior secretary since early 2017 but had faced investigations into his use of security details, chartered flights and a real estate deal in his home state of Montana. Trump had said in November he would look at the allegations.",0

" Pope Francis accused U.S. bishops on Thursday of failing to show unity in the face of a sexual abuse crisis, saying internal bickering had to end over a scandal that has shredded the Church’s credibility. In a long and highly unusual letter sent to U.S. bishops as they embarked on a week-long retreat, Francis said the handling of the scandal showed the urgent need for a new approach to management and mindset within the Roman Catholic Church. “God’s faithful people and the Church’s mission continue to suffer greatly as a result of abuses of power and conscience and sexual abuse, and the poor way that they were handled,” the pope wrote, adding that bishops had “concentrated more on pointing fingers than on seeking paths of reconciliation”. Pope Francis has summoned the heads of some 110 national Catholic bishops’ conferences and dozens of experts and leaders of religious orders to the Vatican on Feb. 21-24 for an extraordinary gathering dedicated to the now global crisis. Victims of clergy sexual abuse are hoping that the meeting will finally come up with a clear policy to make bishops themselves accountable for the mishandling of abuse cases. Ahead of that encounter, U.S. bishops gathered on Wednesday near Chicago for seven days of prayer and spiritual reflection. “The Church’s credibility has been seriously undercut and diminished by these sins and crimes, but even more by the efforts made to deny or conceal them,” Francis said. The pope said he was so concerned by the situation that he had hoped to attend the retreat in person, but added that he had been unable to do so “for logistical reasons”. However, he sent his own preacher, Raniero Cantalamessa, to lead proceedings. The U.S. Church is still reeling from a grand jury report last year that found that 301 priests in the state of Pennsylvania had sexually abused minors over a 70-year period. Other U.S. states have launched investigations of their own. “The hurt caused by these sins and crimes has also deeply affected the communion of bishops, and generated not the sort of healthy and necessary disagreements and tensions found in any living body, but rather division and dispersion,” the pope said. Critics accuse Francis, who became pontiff in 2013, of responding much too slowly to the sex scandals, of failing to empathise with the victims and of blindly believing the word of his fellow clergy. But in 2018 he tried to address past wrongs, publicly admitting he was wrong about a case in Chile and vowing that the Church would never again seek to cover up such wrongdoing. In July, he accepted the resignation of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the U.S. Church’s most prominent figures, following allegations he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy, while in October, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington D.C., stepped down over his handling of abuse cases. “Combatting the culture of abuse, the loss of credibility, the resulting bewilderment and confusion, and the discrediting of our mission urgently demands of us a renewed and decisive approach to resolving conflicts,” the pope wrote on Thursday. “This requires not only a new approach to management, but also a change in our mindset.”",0

" A load of dangerous chemicals that fell off one of the world’s largest container ships into the North Sea washed up on a Dutch beach on Thursday, and more debris was expected to land overnight, officials said. The Dutch Defence Ministry said the loss of 270 containers from the freighter MSC Zoe on Wednesday, some of them thought to contain hazardous chemicals, was one of the biggest incidents of its kind, they said. It was unclear how many of the containers sank to the sea bottom and how many were still floating and could pose a hazard to marine traffic or beach scavengers who turned out in response to reports of the cargo spill. A 25-kg (55-pound) bag of organic peroxide, a strong bleaching agent that can cause injury on contact with skin, was swept ashore on Thursday, among dozens of containers from the ship to have appeared on or near the Dutch islands of Terschelling, Vlieland, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog. “The expectation is that more things may wash up on beaches tonight,” Defence Ministry spokesman Sjaak Van Elten said. At least three of the containers were thought to contain hazardous chemicals. Dutch soldiers were summoned to help clean up the mess. Emergency services warned volunteers not to touch the containers, but scavengers and treasure-hunters also flocked to the jetsam, which included shoes, dolls and flat-screen TVs. The peroxide was removed by emergency crews without incident, Friesland provincial authorities said. But the Dutch Coast Guard said attempts to locate floating containers were being “hindered by multiple sport planes that have come to look ... We ask them to remain out of the area of this air space to prevent dangerous situations”. German authorities are leading the investigation into what caused the accident, which occurred in German waters near the island of Borkum. An MSC statement said the containers were lost overboard during “heavy weather”, and a salvage company had been hired to assist in the cleanup and search for missing items. MSC said it was taking the incident “very seriously, both in terms of the impact of such accidents on the natural environment and in terms of any damage to customers’ cargo”. The MSC Zoe, one of the world’s largest container vessels, is owned by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company. The freighter is now at port in Bremerhaven, Germany.",0
" Dozens of containers with items including flat-screen televisions have washed up on Dutch islands in the North Sea after a ship lost part of its cargo in heavy seas, bringing a windfall for local treasure hunters. The Dutch Coast Guard said up to 270 containers had fallen off the Panamanian-flagged MSC ZOE, one of the world’s biggest container ships, in rough weather near the German island of Borkum and floated southwest toward Dutch waters. Containers broke open on the shores of the Dutch islands of Terschelling and Vlieland. Others were floating or stranded off the coasts of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog, part of a chain of islands that guard the Dutch coast. The Coast Guard warned ships in the area to beware of floating containers. Three containers holding hazardous materials have not yet been located, the Coast Guard said. Dutch media reported that local treasure hunters had found an array of items from containers whose contents had spilled, including light bulbs, car parts, Ikea furniture, clothing and toys. Local media carried pictures of groups of people congregating around beached blue containers and one carrying off what appeared to be a flatscreen TV still packed in foam. Such material is considered flotsam, and residents of the islands have a centuries-old tradition of collecting it. It was unclear if the goods were water-damaged. The mayor of the island of Vlieland, Tineke Schokker, said that the municipality doesn’t mind scavenging. “It’s just really nice of people,” she told local news agency ANP. “Processing it would cost more than the stuff is worth, and anyway with the two officers we have it would be impossible to guard, the stuff is littered over the whole beach.” A spokesman for the ship’s operator, MSC, had no immediate comment.",0
" The United Nations envoy to Somalia warned on Thursday that the arrest of a former militant leader could deter others from choosing politics over violence, speaking publicly about the incident despite being kicked out of the country just days earlier for privately expressing his concerns to the government. Nicholas Haysom briefed the U.N. Security Council in New York but did not address a statement issued by Somalia’s foreign affairs ministry late on Tuesday that accused him of interfering in internal affairs and said he “cannot work in this country.” Haysom had raised questions in a letter on Sunday about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security forces in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who was blocked from running in a recent regional election. He told the 15-member Security Council that the allegations of interference by the federal government in the regional election and the violence that followed the former militant’s arrest “does not bode well for the upcoming electoral processes in other regions or for the 2020 national elections.” “This may also have implications for the likelihood of future al Shabaab defectors who may be considering exchanging violence for a political path,” said Haysom, a South African. Somalia showed no signs on Thursday of backing down from its decision to effectively make Haysom persona non grata. The United Nations said on Wednesday it was looking into the matter and that Haysom would meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday. The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that has lacked strong central government since 1991. The government’s decision on Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semiautonomous regions. Somalia’s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman told the Security Council on Thursday that the Somali people wanted “Somalia leading international support, not international support leading Somalia.” “Somalia distinguishes between the institutions that we are part of and individual conduct that’s had detrimental effect on our fragile nation,” he said. “We reject the criticism and attempt to re-brand renewed terrorists as an ice cream salesperson without redeeming themselves.” Al Shabaab has sought for over a decade to topple the central government and implement its strict version of Islamic law. It was driven out of the capital in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions.",0
" Conservative Hindu groups paralysed India’s southern state of Kerala on Thursday protesting against the state government for allowing two women to defy an ancient ban and enter a Hindu temple. Many small businesses were shut after the groups called for a state-wide stoppage. Most bus services were halted and taxis were refusing to take passengers as some drivers said they feared they would be attacked. Some protesters burst makeshift bombs outside a police station in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, police said. On Thursday morning, about 400 protesters - including some women - marched towards the main city junction in Kochi, the commercial capital of Kerala, to stage a sit-in, shouting slogans and waving flags, with streets otherwise deserted. They were backed by officials from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP. India’s Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on women of menstruating age entering the Sabarimala hill temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year. The temple has refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit have been blocked by thousands of devotees. On Wednesday, two women were escorted by police into the temple through a side gate. They offered prayers from the top of a staircase where they could see the deity below without drawing the attention of the priest or other devotees, a police official familiar with the operation said. He did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. The Kerala state government is run by left-wing parties and has sought to allow women into the temple, a position that has drawn criticism from both of India’s main political parties, the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress. The state’s Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters women were the target of some attacks by protesters, including women journalists covering the event. On Wednesday, a woman police constable was molested by five protesters near Kochi, while a protester was pelted with stones and killed in a southern district of the state, police said. The protests on Thursday remained largely peaceful, Vijay Sakhare, Inspector General of Police Kochi Range, told Reuters. Since Wednesday, police have arrested more than 700 people and taken more than 600 protesters into preventive custody, V.P. Pramod Kumar, deputy director, public relations, state police headquarters, told Reuters. He said police had riot gear, teargas and water cannons in case protests became unruly. In several places protesters damaged state-run buses, Kumar said. A majority of stores in one of the busiest markets in Kochi remained shut even after protesters dispersed in the evening, according to M.C.K Jaleel, the state joint secretary of Kerala Samsthana Vyapari Vyavasayi Samithi, one of the largest merchant associations in the city. The women, Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanaka Durga, 44, had approached state police to find a way to enter the temple after a failed attempt on Dec. 24. For more than a week before Wednesday’s visit, the women were under police protection at an undisclosed location, unknown even to their families, to prevent the plan from leaking out, the police official said. In the early hours of Wednesday, the police took the two women to the hill temple inside an ambulance to avoid attention. Medical services are frequently used outside the temple to help the elderly who go on the trek, the official said. After offering prayers, the women merged with the crowd and headed to the exit, accompanied by four police in plain clothes, the police official said. “Every minute, about 100 devotees throng to the sanctum sanctorum and there was no way the priest would have noticed these two,” he said. Several women turned away by devotees in previous attempts to enter the temple said they had faced a backlash. Bindhu Thankam Kalyani, 43, a teacher in Kerala, who tried to enter Sabarimala in October, said she was harassed by protesters. “They would come to my school and intimidate me,” she said. However, some women who support the ban have criticised the women, saying they were defying religious tradition. “We have been taught from our childhood that women should not go,” said Saritha C. Nair, 35, an entrepreneur. Additional reporting by Jose Devasia; Editing by Janet Lawrence MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED SPONSORED All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday the European Union would not accept clarifications or reassurances on Britain’s Brexit deal that would undermine the spirit of the agreement or render any part of it inoperable. British lawmakers are due to decide later this month whether to accept Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans for a managed exit and relatively close economic ties, or reject the deal and spawn uncertainty about the country’s next steps. Before the vote, May is seeking last-minute reassurances from the European Union over the Irish backstop - an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland. “We want to be in a position to give guarantees, give assurances, give clarifications (but) we need to know what the United Kingdom parliament wants,” Varadkar told journalists in Dublin. “But they need to also understand that there will be no explanation, guarantee or clarification that contradicts or renders inoperable any part of the withdrawal agreement,” he said. Varadkar said he had a long “brainstorming” conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday in which the two leaders agreed that Britain not the EU would need to come up with a proposal to overcome the impasse. Varadkar said he had “given up speculating” on whether Britain would leave the European Union without a deal. But he said his government was now addressing preparations for such an outcome with the same seriousness as it was addressing preparations for an exit under May’s deal. Varadkar’s advisor is due to speak to one of May’s advisors on Thursday he said. Asked about a demand by some pro-Brexit British lawmakers that the backstop be temporary, Varadkar said it was temporary in that it “would apply on a temporary basis unless or until new arrangements supersede it.” (This story corrects paragraph 8 to say Ireland now addressing preparations for a no-deal Brexit alongside those for one under May’s deal)",0
" Lawyers for Bijan Rafiekian, the ex-business partner of former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn, said Thursday they want to delay the upcoming February criminal trial into whether their client covertly lobbied for Turkey. During a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Rafiekian’s attorney Robert Trout said he needs more time to review evidence turned over on Thursday morning, and plans to ask the judge to move the trial from February 11 to sometime in September. Rafiekian, a former U.S. Export-Import Bank director and co-founder of the consultancy firm Flynn Intel Group, is facing charges that he covertly lobbied for Turkey to discredit and extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen from the United States to Turkey. He was indicted in December along with Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-Dutch businessman, for failing to disclose their lobbying and lying about the nature of their work. Rafiekian is facing two criminal counts, including acting as a foreign agent and conspiracy, while Alptekin is facing six. Rafiekian has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and Alptekin has previously denied the allegations through a spokesperson. Rafiekian’s indictment came about a year after Flynn was charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. President Donald Trump fired Flynn in early 2017. As part of his plea deal, Flynn also admitted to lying about his role in the Turkish lobbying effort. The case against Rafiekian is being brought by prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia, and not by Mueller’s office. However, prosecutor James Gillis told the judge on Thursday that much of the evidence turned over came from Mueller’s investigators. Last month, a federal judge in Washington fiercely criticized Flynn for lying to the FBI in connection with Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delayed his sentencing until he has finished helping prosecutors. It is unclear whether or not Flynn could be called upon to testify in the case against Rafiekian. Trout said Thursday that as part of his plans to mount a defence, he may seek evidence abroad, including possibly deposing relevant witnesses overseas. Judge Anthony Trenga ordered the defence to file a motion to requesting the trial delay by Jan. 21, and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Feb. 7.",0
" Montenegro has launched a programme offering citizenship to up to 2,000 foreigners in return for investment over the next three years to help speed up its economic development, the government said on Thursday. A passport from Montenegro, an Adriatic country with a population of 620,000 which has joined NATO and aspires to European Union membership, allows its citizens visa-free travel to 117 countries. The EU’S executive is offering guidance to EU states on how to manage national schemes for selling passports and residency permits to wealthy foreign citizens, despite warnings of money-laundering risks from campaigners and lawmakers. The scheme by Montenegro to bring in investment in exchange for citizenship sets it alongside 13 other European countries including Malta, Latvia and Portugal. Under the scheme, potential candidates should donate 100,000 euros ($113,670) for development of poor communities and invest either 250,000 euros into development projects in northern and central Montenegro or 450,000 euros into projects in the capital Podgorica or along the coastline, the government said. It also issued a tender seeking to hire due diligence agents specialised in checking interested applicants, as well as some audit firms or legal advisers to perform all other necessary checks of interested candidates. “The programme aims to further accelerate Montenegro’s economic development by creating new tourist, agricultural and processing capacities and creating new jobs,” the government said in a statement.

" Ana Luz, sister-in-law of Ronald Blanco, looked on grimly as neighbours of the murdered Honduran man washed away the rills of blood left where his bullet-ridden body had lain outside his house in a troubled barrio on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa. It was just one of many scenes I witnessed this year while on assignment in Honduras, where thousands of people sought to escape violence and poverty by joining a migrant caravan in hope of making it to safety across the Mexico-U.S. border. The problems in this small Central American country grabbed international attention as U.S. President Donald Trump cracked down on illegal immigration. Honduras has for years been one of the world’s most murderous countries. Though official data show the homicide rate has fallen sharply, it continues to be a highly challenging environment in which to work. According to Honduran government figures, the homicide rate reached 86 per 100,000 people in 2011-2012. This year, the rate should end below 40 per 100,000, the security ministry says. This compares to the latest statistics in the United States, where there were 5.3 murders per 100,000 in 2017, according to the FBI’s most recent report on its website. Danger in Honduras is never far away. During my roughly three months spent in Honduras in 2018, I photographed mothers waiting at the morgue for the bodies of murdered sons and daughters, police keeping watch over corpses left lying on streets after shootouts and families wailing over the coffins of loved ones. Blanco, 37, lived in the Japon neighbourhood, a breeding ground for gang violence, according to local authorities. It was here that I experienced the most tense moment of my time in Honduras, as I moved between police, soldiers, gang members, forensic experts, hearse drivers and pastors. At Blanco’s funeral, I was stopped by a young man with piercing eyes, one green and one blue. He demanded to know why I was there. I explained that I was a journalist taking photographs of the event. But the youth kept pressing me with questions about what had brought me to Blanco’s funeral. As I continued taking the photos, I felt increasingly uncomfortable. Finally, the tension eased when one of Blanco’s friends intervened, saying that the grieving family had authorized my presence. For photo essay, please click on: reut.rs/2EVrBhU",0
" The Tokyo District Court said on Monday it has extended the detention of ousted Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) chairman Carlos Ghosn by 10 days until Jan. 11. Ghosn, accused of aggravated breach of trust, is facing allegations of making the car maker shoulder 1.85 billion yen (13.2 million pounds) in personal investment losses. The latest extension will see Ghosn remain in Tokyo’s main detention centre, where he has been confined since his first arrest on Nov. 19 on allegations of financial misconduct. Since then, he has been re-arrested twice over the latest allegations and on claims that he underreported his Nissan salary for a prolonged period. He denies the allegations. Calls to the office of Ghosn’s lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, were not answered on Monday, an unofficial holiday in Japan. A Nissan spokesman said the car maker was not in a position to comment on the latest development in the case. “The company’s own investigation is ongoing, and its scope continues to broaden,” the spokesman said. The decision to extend Ghosn’s time in detention comes a day before his 10-day detention period for the latest allegation was set to expire on Tuesday, and follows the release of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly on bail last week after a court ruled against extending his detention while he awaits trial. Both Ghosn and Kelly were initially arrested in late November and have been charged with underreporting Ghosn’s salary at Nissan over a five-year period from 2010. Both deny the charges. Nissan’s board in November fired Ghosn as chairman and Kelly as representative director, although both men technically still remain board members who can only be removed by shareholders. Ghosn’s arrest has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan’s ties with French automaking partner Renault SA (RENA.PA), where Ghosn still remains chairman and CEO. Ghosn served as CEO of Nissan for more than a decade through 2017 and concurrently held the chairman position at Renault, Nissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) until his arrest. The three automakers are linked by a complicated share-holding structure under which Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, and Nissan holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, with no voting rights. Nissan holds a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Since Ghosn’s arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault. Ghosn’s arrest has also put Japan’s criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defence lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day. Ghosn is being held in the spartan Tokyo Detention Centre, a tower-like structure in the eastern part of Tokyo, over New Year in addition to Christmas. The detention centre, with its many rules and restrictions, makes for a stark contrast with his comfortable, globe-trotting lifestyle.",0

" The future of Kurdish-led areas of northern and eastern Syria has been thrown into doubt by President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops who have helped to secure the region. Amounting to about one quarter of Syria, the area is the largest chunk of territory still outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia and Iran. Trump said on Wednesday the United States would withdraw slowly “over a period of time” and would protect the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters as Washington withdraws troops, but without giving a timetable. Syrian Kurdish leaders fear Turkey will use the withdrawal as an opportunity to launch an assault. As a result, they are in contact with Moscow and Damascus in the hope of agreeing arrangements to protect the region from Turkey while also aiming to safeguard their political gains. The main Syrian Kurdish faction, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), began to establish a foothold in the north early in the war as government forces withdrew to put down the anti-Assad uprising elsewhere. An affiliated militia, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), secured the region. Early in the conflict, their control was concentrated in three predominantly Kurdish regions home to roughly 2 million Kurds. Kurdish-led governing bodies were set up. The area of YPG influence expanded as the YPG allied with the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State (IS), becoming the spearhead of a multi-ethnic militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). SDF influence widened to Manbij and Raqqa as IS was defeated in both. It has also reached deep into Deir al-Zor, where the SDF is still fighting IS. Kurdish leaders say their aim is regional autonomy within a decentralised Syria, not independence. The PYD is heavily influenced by the ideas of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey for Kurdish political and cultural rights. Ocalan has been in jail since 1999 in Turkey. He is convicted of treason. The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkey says the PKK is indistinguishable from the PYD and YPG. Turkey has a Kurdish minority equal to 15 to 20 percent of its population, mostly living in eastern and southeastern areas bordering Syria. Wary of separatistism, Turkey views the PYD’s Syrian foothold as a national security threat. Syria’s main Kurdish groups do not hide Ocalan’s influence: they organised elections towards establishing a political system based on his ideas. Turkey has already mounted two cross-border offensives in northern Syria as part of its efforts to counter the YPG. Syria’s Baathist state systematically persecuted the Kurds before the war. Yet the YPG and Damascus have broadly stayed out of each other’s way during the conflict, despite occasional clashes. They also have been seen to cooperate against shared foes, notably in and around Aleppo. The YPG has allowed the Syrian state to keep a foothold in its areas. The YPG commander told Reuters in 2017 it would have no problem with the Assad government if Kurdish rights are guaranteed in Syria. But Damascus opposes Kurdish autonomy demands: the Syrian foreign minister last month said “nobody in Syria accepts talk about independent entities or federalism”. Talks between the sides last year made no progress. The Kurdish-led authorities are launching a new initiative aiming to put pressure on the government to reach a political settlement “within the framework of a decentralized Syria,” leading Kurdish politician Ilham Ahmed said last week. Analysts say the Kurds’ negotiating position has been weakened by Trump’s announcement. WHAT WOULD AN ASSAD-KURD DEAL MEAN FOR THE WAR? The territory held by Damascus and the Kurdish-led authorities accounts for most of Syria. A political settlement - if one could be reached, perhaps with Russian help - could go a long way to stitching the map back together. But it would not mark the end of the war. Anti-Assad insurgents, though defeated across much of Syria by the government and its allies, still have a foothold in the northwest stretching from Idlib through Afrin to Jarablus. Turkey has troops on the ground in this area. The rebels include Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army groups and jihadists. Enmity runs deep between the YPG and these groups. For the YPG, one priority is recovering Afrin from the rebels who seized it in a Turkey-backed offensive last year. Assad also wants Turkey out as he vows to recover “every inch” of Syria.

" A music video by Beyonce and Jay-Z set in the Louvre helped boost visitor numbers to a record 10.2 million last year, the most for any museum in history, the Louvre said on Thursday. A rebound in tourist numbers to Paris, following a drop after Islamist militants killed 130 people in the French capital in November 2015, also helped the museum achieve a 25 percent increase in visitors on the previous year. The Louvre said it was happy at the response to the video by Beyonce and her husband Jay-Z for the song “APES**T” in which they perform in front of the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo and other famous artworks. It has been viewed nearly 150 million times on YouTube. “It is good to see that these American artists, creators of today, are interested in a museum of archaeology and ancient art,” Louvre Director Jean-Luc Martinez told Reuters. The Louvre’s previous record was 9.7 million visitors, in 2012, when the museum inaugurated its Islamic Art section and held exhibitions on Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. Three-quarters of the visitors are foreigners, with about 1.5 million American and 1 million Chinese tourists. Indicating that the sometimes violent “yellow vest” protests in the final weeks of last year had not damaged tourism, the French Center for National Monuments also reported record 2018 numbers, with 10.2 million visitors, up 8 percent, to the 100 sites it manages. The previous record was in 2014. The Arc de Triomphe, despite being closed for two weeks last month after being defaced by yellow vest protests against government reforms, was France’s most popular monument in 2018, with 1.7 million visitors, followed by the Mont-Saint-Michel island in Normandy, with 1.4 million. Full-year tourist numbers for the Paris region are not yet available, but in the first half of 2018 it booked a record number of 17.1 million arrivals and said it was hoping for a full-year record of 50 million.",0
" Five women and three men died in the train accident on a bridge linking Denmark’s two main islands, and they were probably all Danes, police said on Thursday. Very severe injuries made the identification difficult, the police said. The police are reasonably confident about the identities of four victims and have a good idea of who the other four people are, based on the possessions and other traces found on the train, they said. “The police can now conclude with a large degree of certainty that there were no foreign nationals among the fatalities,” the police said. The train with 131 passengers on board was heading towards the capital Copenhagen when it hit debris from an oncoming freight train. The accident happened early Wednesday morning during a severe storm that hampered the rescue operation on the 18-km (11-mile) Great Belt Bridge between Zealand and Funen, Denmark’s two major islands.",0
" It is three o’clock in the morning and Artak Tadevosyan is wafting incense through the corridors of Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site where Christians believe Jesus Christ was crucified and buried. “Walking in the Lord’s footsteps, really, you have feelings that cannot be explained,” said the 26-year-old Armenian Orthodox cleric. “We don’t see it as stone, all these are holy places for us.” The Holy Sepulchre lies in Jerusalem’s Old City. A church was first built there in the 4th century under Constantine the Great, the Roman emperor who converted to Christianity. Today, the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches share custody of the building, and tensions sometimes run high over who controls what. Other denominations also hold services there, in languages including Latin, Arabic, Aramaic, Amharic and Ge’ez. At night the building falls silent. Muslim families have long held the door key, because of the tensions between the Christian clergy. In the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate nearby, His Beatitude Theophilos III, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, said he feels deep reverence for the church. “For the Christian world the Holy Sepulchre is the heart of Jerusalem and the world,” he said during preparations for the Orthodox Christmas on Sunday. “Why? Because this particular place, which is the rock of the crucifixion and the rock of the tomb, or the burial site, of Jesus Christ, has been watered, and therefore blessed, by the blood of The Righteous One.” Click on reut.rs/2BRkPqm to see a related photo essay",0
" Senegal’s Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that jailed presidential hopeful Khalifa Sall could not appeal a prison sentence for embezzlement, his lawyers said, likely ending his chance of running as a free man in February polls. The popular former mayor of Dakar was arrested in March 2017 on suspicion of embezzling 1.8 billion CFA francs ($3 million) in public funds. Last year he was sentenced to five years in jail. Opponents of President Macky Sall, who is no relation to Khalifa, say he has tried to silence political opposition ahead of the Feb. 24 election. The ruling party and state lawyers have denied that. In a report last year, Amnesty International criticised the Senegalese government for cracking down on peaceful demonstrations and said the judiciary handling Khalifa’s case “showed a lack of independence”. Khalifa Sall’s lawyer, Seydou Diagne, said his client had not been stripped of his political rights and still stood a chance of running in the election. Diagne said he plans to take the case to another chamber of the court, which would take more than a month. State lawyers were not available for comment. Despite his imprisonment, Khalifa Sall was one of just five candidates who collected the 53,000 supporting signatures required to run for election. Karim Wade, the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade, also collected enough signatures. He served three years of a six-year prison sentence for corruption between 2015 and 2017 before going into exile in Qatar. Senegalese law bans citizens sentenced to more than five years in prison from running for election. The Constitutional Council said it would publish a final list of approved candidates on Jan. 21. Senegal has had three largely peaceful transitions of power since independence from France in 1960.

" Germany’s Agriculture Minister wants to loosen restrictions on shooting wolves to reduce a growing population that threatens sheep and goats. Wolves disappeared from Germany a century ago after many were killed, in part because they are symbols of cunning and wickedness in German folklore but also because they attack farm animals and even humans. They have made a comeback across Germany and the ministry says more than 600 now roam a northern belt from the border with Poland and the Czech Republic to the Dutch frontier. Wolves killed more than 1,000 farm animals in 2016, said the ministry. Farmers say their animals are being ravaged and hunters say wolves eat game they want to shoot and even damage trees. But their legal protection is viewed as sacrosanct by animal welfare and biodiversity groups. The wolf population will likely rise by an annual 30 percent, the ministry said on its website. “This excellent success in terms of species protection is a challenge for those keeping grazing animals,” it said. Agriculture Minister Julia Kloecker wrote last month to her counterpart in the environment ministry, Svenja Schulze, to lobby for a change in the rules to allow more wolves to be shot as part of a moderate regulation of the wolf population. It was unclear who would be licensed do to do the shooting. She said an earlier suggestion by Schulze to allow the removal of individual wolves that pose a danger was a step in the right direction but was insufficient. Wolf management is a political issue and there was even a clause on the need to come up with a strategy on wolves in last year’s coalition deal between the conservatives of Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Social Democrats. Currently, farmers can get compensation for farm animals that fall prey to wolves and subsidies for electric fences are available to help keep them out. The latest data from the Federal Office for the Protection of Nature shows Germany has 73 packs of wolves, 13 more than a year earlier, and for the first time, the southern state of Bavaria has its own pack.

" Short of time to save his sinking economy, Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir boarded a Russian jet on Dec. 17 and became the first Arab leader to visit Damascus since 2011, renewing what has been seen as a push for the financial help he needs to survive. Events at home soon caught up with him. Two days later, demonstrators angered by bread price rises torched the ruling party headquarters in the city of Atbara, setting off two weeks of protests that quickly spread across the country, with crowds calling on Bashir to step down. The protests are the most sustained challenge to Bashir since he took power in an Islamist-backed coup nearly 30 years ago, more widespread and longer-lasting than bouts of unrest in September 2013 and January 2018. They risk propelling Sudan deeper into crisis, upending Bashir’s attempt to stave off financial collapse and destabilising a country beset by simmering internal conflicts that straddles Africa and the Middle East. “What we are witnessing today is the second and stronger wave of the protests that swept Sudan in September 2013. Frustration with the rising cost of living has been building up and is now boiling over again,” said independent analyst Muhammad Osman. Officials have acknowledged 19 deaths in the demonstrations. Amnesty International said last week it had credible reports that 37 protesters had been shot dead. “Bashir and his inner circle will not go down without a fight,” said Osman. Bashir has survived as one of the region’s longest serving leaders, riding out 20 years of U.S. sanctions and shrugging off an indictment by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide in Darfur. The protests come as the 75-year-old has been pushing to shore up his position economically as well as politically, lobbying to be removed from the list of countries, along with Syria, Iran and North Korea, that the U.S. considers state sponsors of terrorism. That listing has prevented an influx of investment and financial aid that Sudan was hoping for when the U.S. lifted sanctions October 2017, according to economists. Instead, Sudan has been rapidly expanding its money supply to finance its budget deficit, causing spiralling inflation officially recorded at nearly 70 percent and a steep decline in the value of its currency. During his trip to Damascus, Bashir was courting the Russians by helping rehabilitate their ally Bashar al-Assad after Syria’s civil war in order to win financial support or play them off against the U.S., analysts said. Bashir has also sought favour with Gulf states including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cutting ties with Iran in 2016 and contributing troops to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, even while maintaining close relations with two of their regional rivals, Qatar and Turkey. “The confusion in Sudanese foreign policy and the shift from one alliance to another is caused by the severe economic crisis in the country and President al-Bashir wants to obtain quick economic aid,” said Faisal Mohamed Saleh, a journalist and political analyst in Khartoum. Those economic problems, at the root of discontent that has simmered for years, accelerated after Sudan lost three-quarters of its oil production when the south of the country seceded in 2011. In the eyes of protesters, the economic troubles are deeply entwined with corruption and mismanagement in the political elite and the ruling National Congress Party (NCP), said Amjed Farid Eltayeb, an activist and spokesman for the Sudan Change Now movement. “The NCP for the last 30 years have directed most of the national budget to the security apparatus, to the militias, and they cut all the funding of the social services, education, health,” he said. “So those people who are now in the streets have no social protection nets, they are alone in a battle with fate ... they have nothing to lose.” Opposition parties are emasculated, and the protests so far are leaderless, with demonstrators coalescing in individual towns and neighbourhoods, and circumventing blocks on social media to share information on the web. Chanting the line made famous in the Arab Spring protests of 2011 - “The people want the fall of the regime” - they have continued to rally despite security forces using live ammunition, tear gas, and stun grenades to disperse them. With Sudan in its worst economic crisis since independence in 1956, Bashir risks the fate of other authoritarian rulers toppled eight years ago unless the NCP switches candidate ahead of elections due next year, said Eltayeb Zine al-Abedine, a political science professor at the University of Khartoum. “The economic crisis and public discontent are lessening the chances of President Omar al-Bashir running for the 2020 elections,” he said. But Bashir shows no sign of stepping aside. Members of Khartoum’s parliament, which is dominated by the NCP, proposed a constitutional amendment last month to extend term limits that would have required Bashir to step down in 2020. Since the demonstrations began, Bashir has appeared largely unperturbed, tempering his talk of conspiracies against Sudan with pledges of economic reform, calls for restraint and the announcement of a fact-finding committee – steps dismissed by protesters as symbolic. “We are committed to holding free and fair elections in 2020, and we ask that all political powers prepare to participate,” Bashir said on Monday.

" Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said President Donald Trump reassured him about his plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and his commitment to defeating Islamic State during a White House meeting on Sunday. “We talked about Syria. He told me some things I didn’t know that made me feel a lot better about where we’re headed in Syria,” Graham told reporters outside the White House after the meeting. “We still have some differences but I will tell you that the president is thinking long and hard about Syria - how to withdraw our forces but at the same time achieve our national security interests.”",0
" The British government will spend more than 100 million pounds chartering extra sea ferries to ease cross-Channel congestion if the United Kingdom fails to secure a trade deal before leaving the European Union next year. Just three months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world’s largest bloc, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising — the nightmare scenario for many businesses, which are now planning for an economic shock. Extra ships will be needed to work new routes across the Channel in the event that the main French terminal of Calais and Britain’s Dover and Folkestone are clogged up by customs checks. Currently, Britain’s membership of the EU means that trucks drive smoothly through border checks within the bloc. But in a no-deal Brexit, even a few minutes’ delay at customs for each truck would be likely to mean vehicles backing up at ports and queuing on feeder roads on both sides of the Channel. To ease a potential backlog, the government has awarded three contracts to provide additional freight capacity on routes from English south-coast ports including Poole, Portsmouth and Plymouth. They comprise one worth 47 million pounds with the French firm Brittany Ferries, a 47 million pound deal with the Danish shipping company DFDS and a 14 million pound contract with Seaborne Freight. The leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat party, Vince Cable, called the move “complete madness” and said public money was being spent recklessly in a last-minute bid to prepare for a no-deal outcome. The contracts were not put out to tender. The Department for Transport said it was responding to a “situation of extreme urgency” brought about by “unforeseeable events”. About 16,000 trucks pass between Dover and Calais every day, transporting everything from perishable food to medicines and the industrial goods needed to keep factories running. “This extra capacity is a small but important element of the DfT’s no-deal planning,” the Department for Transport said in a statement. “While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached, the department is helping ensure the rest of government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios.” Earlier this month, the government announced that all government departments must step up planning for a no-deal Brexit, including putting 3,500 armed forces personnel on standby to deal with any disruption.

" The number of British citizens applying for Irish passports rose by 22 percent in 2018, Ireland’s foreign office said on Monday, more than doubling the total of annual applications since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Almost 100,000 eligible Britons sought to hang onto their EU citizenship via a passport from their nearest neighbour this year, up from 81,000 last year and 46,000 in 2015, the year before the Brexit vote led to a sharp rise in applications. Anybody born in the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland, or with an Irish parent or grandparent, is entitled to an Irish passport - a total of about 6 million British citizens. They are able to hold dual citizenship. Registrations for Irish passports in Northern Ireland, whose citizens can hold both an Irish and British passport as the province is part of the United Kingdom, rose by 2 percent in the year to the end of December. With three months left until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, the draft divorce deal reached between both sides is floundering ahead of a planned vote in the British parliament next month, opening up a range of possibilities from a Brexit without a trade deal to calling it off entirely.",0
" Sudanese security forces on Thursday fired tear gas to disperse protesters who were trying to deliver an anti-government petition to the local headquarters of President Omar al-Bashir’s ruling party in Port Sudan, a witness said. More than 200 people took part in the demonstration, which broke up before the protesters reached the building. Sudan has been hit by a series of protests triggered by price increases and shortages of cash and fuel following months of worsening economic conditions. Many protesters have called for an end to Bashir’s rule. Security forces have blocked and broken up demonstrations using live ammunition as well as tear gas and stun grenades, witnesses say. They have also detained some protesters and opposition figures. Earlier on Thursday, Bashir said in a speech the government was looking into handing out pay rises, starting this month, but he did not say by how much salaries would increase. The protesters in Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, represented a group of political parties who want Bashir to dissolve the government and form a transitional administration that would set a date for elections. Signatories to the petition include the Umma Party, led by opposition figure Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, the Reform Now Movement, and the Democratic Unionist Party. The petition also calls for the investigation of alleged abuses by security forces during two weeks of anti-government demonstrations across Sudan. Bashir and the head of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service have called for restraint in the response to the protests, which officials have blamed on infiltrators.

" Thirty-nine bodies have been pulled from under the rubble of a Russian apartment building that partially collapsed this week after an apparent gas explosion, Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. The blast in the early hours of December 31 damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. The death toll has progressively risen in the past few days as rescuers battle blisteringly cold temperatures to recover people trapped under the rubble. The emergencies ministry said earlier on Thursday that 37 people had been killed. But the death toll went up to 39 when rescuers recovered another two bodies from the rubble on Thursday afternoon. Deputy Emergencies Minister Alexander Chupriyan told Interfax there were no more bodies under the rubble and that the search and rescue operation was over. A Reuters witness at the scene said that workers were removing debris from the site using cranes and other equipment. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, has said it is still investigating the exact cause of the blast. It said no traces of explosives had been found at the site. Initial reports attributed the blast to a gas explosion. Gas explosions are relatively common in Russia because of ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas use.",0
" Saudi Arabian prosecutors is seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 suspects detained over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the state news agency SPA said on Thursday, as a Saudi court held a first hearing on the case. Saudi Arabia said it also sent new letters to the Turkish public prosecutor asking for “any evidence connected to this case”, which has rattled the Saudi royal court and damaged the reputation of 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi was close to the royal circles before becoming a critic of Prince Mohammed, writing for the Washington Post and speaking to international media about Saudi politics when he moved to the United States last year. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, in which Khashoggi’s body was dismembered, removed from the building and handed over to an unidentified “local cooperator”. The whereabouts of Khashoggi’s remains are still unknown. A Turkish television channel on Monday showed men carrying suitcases purportedly containing the remains into the residence of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul. “The initial hearing for the 11 individuals indicted by the Public Prosecution in the case of the murder of citizen Jamal Khashoggi was held today ... in the Criminal Court of Riyadh,” a statement from the Saudi prosecutor carried by SPA said. The prosecutor’s office said it was seeking the death penalty for five individuals among the 11 indicted. Ten other suspects were still under investigation. Without naming them, the prosecutor said last November the five individuals facing by the death penalty were “charged with ordering and committing the crime”. SPA added that the defendants’ lawyers attended the hearing and the court approved a request from the 11 for more time to prepare their defence. It gave no details on the next hearing. Saudi King Salman sacked Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to Prince Mohammed, Istanbul Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri in connection with Khashoggi’s murder. The kingdom has come under heavy international pressure, including from the United States, its closest ally, whose Senate has voted in favour of a resolution blaming the crown prince for the murder. U.S. senators were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies which concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the operation to kill Khashoggi. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Khashoggi’s killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership. Thursday’s statement said the kingdom was still awaiting responses to requests for information sent to Turkish officials. Last week, King Salman put Ibrahim al-Assaf, a veteran former finance minister, in charge of foreign affairs, in an effort to improve the kingdom’s image after the crisis caused by the killing. Assaf replaced Adel al-Jubeir, and experts in Saudi politics said the move reflected a perception that Jubeir was tainted by having served as Riyadh’s chief global defender during the Khashoggi affair.

" Iran’s health minister has resigned over proposed budget cuts, the official news agency IRNA reported, amid an economic crisis wrought by the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran. IRNA said on Thursday President Hassan Rouhani accepted the resignation of Hassan Ghazizadeh Hashemi, widely seen as the key official behind the 2014 launch of an ambitious plan for universal medical insurance sometimes dubbed “Rouhanicare”. Hashemi had repeatedly complained about delays in payments of budgeted funds in the past and about cuts in his ministry’s budget under the new state spending plans, IRNA said. U.S. President Donald Trump reintroduced sanctions on Iran last year, targeting in particular the country’s lifeblood oil sector, after pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal. The move has helped depress the value of Iran’s rial currency and aggravated annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in November. Last month, Rouhani presented a $47 billion draft state budget with increased spending on lower income groups, saying the U.S. sanctions would affect people’s lives and economic growth but not bring the government to its knees. Despite the rise in the rial value of the budget, however, it is effectively worth about half of the current budget because of the recent weakening of the currency and galloping inflation. In recent months, various Iranian cities have been rocked by demonstrations as factory workers, teachers, truck drivers and farmers protested against economic hardship and corruption.",0
" An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 hit southern Japan on Thursday but no tsunami warning was issued, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said, and there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The quake, which struck at 6:10 p.m. (0910 GMT), was centred in Kumamoto prefecture on the southern island of Kyushu, at a depth of 10 km (6 miles), JMA said. Public broadcaster NHK reported that nuclear power facilities in the region were operating as normal. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.",0
" Two militants in Tunisia blew themselves up on Thursday after they exchanged fire with security forces who stormed their hideout and encircled them, the interior ministry said. The existence of the cell in the city of Jilma, 250 km (156 miles) south of the capital, shows the challenge Tunisia faces from militants, some of whom cross the porous borders from Libya and Algeria. Authorities identified Ezzedine Alaoui, leader of the Brigade of Jihad and Unity, as among the dead, said Soufien Sliti, a spokesman for the counter-terrorism agency. He was the mastermind of a terrorist plot to take control of Sidi Bouzid province south of Tunis, Sliti said. Aloui joined Jund Al Khilafa, another militant group in the mountains between Sidi Bouzid and Kasserine, in 2014 but left to join the Brigade of Jihad and Unity, that came to be known as the cell of Sidi Bouzid, Sliti said. Most members of the cell were arrested on Dec. 5 in Sidi Bouzid in an operation during which material for making bombs was seized. Since an uprising against autocratic leader Zine Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, Tunisia has been battling militant groups operating in remote areas near the border with Algeria. Authorities estimate about 3,000 Tunisians have joined Islamic State and other jihadist groups in Iraq, Syria and Libya, while high unemployment has stoked unrest in recent years in southern and central areas. Dozens died in attacks in 2015 including two against tourists, one at a museum in Tunis and another on a beach in Sousse. A third attack targeted presidential guards in the capital and killed 12. Islamic State claimed the attacks. (This story has been refiled to add dropped word in headline)",0
" India on Thursday deported a Rohingya Muslim family of five to neighbouring Myanmar, the second such group expelled in four months during a crackdown on illegal immigrants. India’s Hindu nationalist government regards the Rohingya as illegal aliens and a security risk. It has ordered that tens of thousands of the community, who live in small settlements and slums, be identified and repatriated. The husband, wife and three children had been arrested and jailed in northeastern Assam state in 2014 for entering India without valid documents, police said. “The five Rohingya have been handed over to Myanmar officials and they crossed the border,” Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, Assam’s additional director general of police, told Reuters. A Reuters picture from the India-Myanmar border showed the family members posing, with security officials of both countries standing behind them. Jails in Assam held 20 more Myanmar nationals, all arrested for illegal entry, he added. But it was not immediately clear if all were Rohingya, a largely stateless Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. “We shall send them back to Myanmar once we get their travel permits from that country,” Mahanta said. “Most of them sneaked into India in search of a livelihood.” India’s first deportation of seven Rohingya men to Myanmar in October sparked fears of further repatriations among those sheltering in its refugee camps, and concern that those returned faced the risk of abuse at the hands of Myanmar authorities. The men returned to their villages in a relatively untroubled area of Kyauktaw in the northern Rakhine state. They have been given so-called National Verification Cards, a residency document that conveys a status short of citizenship. India’s Border Security Force arrested 230 Rohingya last year until end-November, the highest number of detentions in at least four full years, the Ministry of Home Affairs told parliament on Tuesday. India estimates that 40,000 Rohingya live in the country in camps across the country, including the capital, New Delhi, having arrived over the years after fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar, which denies them citizenship. In August, a U.N. report accused the Myanmar military of mass killings and rapes of Rohingya with “genocidal intent” in 2017 in an operation that drove more than 700,000 of them to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies. Myanmar has denied the charges, saying its military launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by Muslim militants in August last year.

" President Emmanuel Macron’s head of media relations said on Thursday he would quit, a sign that a gruelling reform drive and a spate of political scandal and street protests are starting to wear down his inner circle a year and a half into his mandate. Sylvain Fort, who shaped Macron’s campaign messaging during his presidential campaign and penned some of the young leader’s most memorable speeches, will leave the Elysee palace for “personal reasons”, government ministers said. “After two years and a half of relentless work serving the candidate and later our president, I wish to pursue other professional and personal projects, and above all dedicate more time to my family,” Fort told French news agency AFP. His resignation follows the departure of Macron’s political adviser late last year to lead the ruling party’s European parliament election campaign. Rumours are swirling in French media of other close advisers who may head out the door. Privately, aides say the pace of reforms, Macron’s own hyperactivity, his frequent foreign trips and a relentless news cycle are taking their toll on even the most committed of his loyalists. Fort, an opera buff and literature graduate from the elite ENS school, preferred the more reclusive role of chief speechwriter after Macron’s election victory in May 2017. Macron persuaded Fort to return to a front-line media relations role last summer after the violent conduct of Macron’s former bodyguard and the Elysee’s attempted cover-up of the matter sent his popularity into a nosedive and raised questions about decision-making inside the president’s office. Surrounded by a small coterie of close aides dubbed the “Macron boys”, the 41-year-old pushed through a series of reforms to liberalise the economy and cut taxes in his first 15 months in office. But popular perceptions of an arrogant president whose monarchical style leaves him detached from the daily realities of most French people triggered street unrest in late 2018. The so-called “yellow vest” protests forced tax concessions and cast doubt over Macron’s ability to see through his reform agenda. He wants to adopt stricter rules for unemployment benefits, merge varying pension plans into a single system, and create a leaner public sector - all prickly subjects that could give a new lease of life to the “yellow vests”. In his New Year message, Macron, whose popularity rating is at a record low, was unrepentant as he promised to press on. “In recent years, we’ve engaged in a blatant denial of reality,” he said. “We can’t work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending.”",0
" Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will remain in place for “a while” thanks to support from Russia, even though Britain’s position was still that he remains a block to lasting peace. “The British long-standing position is that we won’t have lasting peace in Syria with that (Assad-led) regime, but regretfully, we do think he’s going to be around for a while,” Hunt told Sky News. Nearly eight years into a war that has displaced millions of Syrians, Assad has recovered control of most of the country with support from Russia, Iran, and Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim groups such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Last week, the United Arab Emirates reopened its embassy in Damascus, marking a diplomatic boost for Assad from a U.S.-allied Arab state that once backed rebels fighting him.",0
" Emmanuel Macron’s former security aide, who was sacked this summer after his violent conduct fuelled a political scandal, acknowledged on Sunday he was still travelling on a diplomatic passport, in an affair that has rattled the French presidency. After he was fired when a video emerged of his beating a May Day protester, Alexandre Benalla returned to the spotlight in France this week, under scrutiny over his recent consultancy work and unauthorised use of diplomatic passports. The original Benalla scandal became a major headache for Macron just over a year into his tenure, after the president, whose popularity ratings have since slipped, was criticised for acting too slowly in dealing with a member of his inner circle. Benalla said in an interview with France’s Journal du Dimanche (JDD) on Sunday that he would return the diplomatic passports in the coming days, and rejected that he was somehow trying to profit from his status as a former insider by using them or in his work as a consultant. “Maybe I was wrong to use these passports,” Benalla said, in a telephone conversation from overseas according to the JDD. “But I want to make it clear that I only did it for my own ease, to facilitate my passage through airports.” The French presidency has sought to distance itself from the former bodyguard, and the government said it had formally requested the passports be returned on at least two occasions. Paris prosecutors on Saturday opened a preliminary inquiry into Benalla’s usage of the passports. Benalla maintained in the JDD, however, that he had initially returned the two ID documents in August, and that they were returned to him along with other personal items by a member of the president’s staff in October. Scrutiny over Benalla comes at a sensitive time for Macron, who is grappling with a wave of “yellow vest” street protests by disgruntled voters calling for more measures to help lift household incomes.",0
" Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new leader of Germany’s Christian Democrats, heads into 2019 more popular than Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported her rise to the top of their party, an opinion poll showed on Sunday. The survey by pollster Emnid for weekly newspaper Bild am Sonntag showed 45 percent of 507 voters surveyed wanted Kramp-Karrenbauer to play a leading role among Germany’s top politicians in the coming year, ahead of Merkel on 40 percent. Kramp-Karrenbauer, the continuity candidate favoured by the party elite, won a tight victory over the more conservative Friedrich Merz in a run-off vote earlier this month to decide the new leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The victory put her in poll position to succeed Merkel as chancellor. The Emnid poll showed 33 percent of those surveyed wanted Merz to have as much impact as possible in 2019. Merz, who returned from a decade in the political wilderness to seek the CDU leadership, has said he is ready to go back into politics full time and could even serve as a minister. His narrow loss to Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel’s protege, highlighted deep divisions in the CDU that the party is eager to heal ahead of four regional elections next year. Merkel, German chancellor for the last 13 years, decided in October to step down as party leader after the CDU haemorrhaged support in another regional vote. A separate survey, by pollster YouGov, showed 43 percent of those questioned wanted Merkel to remain chancellor until the end of this legislative period in 2021, as she would like, with 38 percent wanting her to go early and 18 percent undecided. Merkel’s fate partly depends on her coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), whose leaders are under pressure from some in their ranks to pull out of the government and rebuild in opposition. SPD leader Andrea Nahles said she was “bitterly disappointed” by the coalition, which formed in March, but that it had performed better in the last two months. She also sounded positive when asked about working with Kramp-Karrenbauer. “In the new generation, we can concentrate on the essentials and do good work,” Nahles told newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

" India’s Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the government to list the steps it plans for the rescue of at least 15 miners trapped in a so-called “rat-hole” coal mine for three weeks in a remote hilly state, warning that “every second counts”. The workers were ensnared on Dec. 13 when the illegal mine in the northeastern state of Meghalaya was flooded. Rescuers have so far only been able to find three helmets and two axes underground. The country’s top court wondered why attempts to reach the miners had not yet been successful. “Tell us by tomorrow, because for people who are trapped, every second counts,” Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri told the federal government, represented by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. The Meghalaya government told the court that nearly 86 people were working on the rescue effort since Dec. 14, including employees of state-controlled Coal India Ltd, the world’s biggest miner of the fuel. Kyrmen Shylla, Meghalaya’s disaster management minister, told Reuters both government and private agencies had been involved in the bid to reach the miners, many of whose family members have given up hope. Rat-hole mining has killed thousands of workers in Meghalaya, including children, before India’s environmental court banned the practice in early 2014. At its peak, the state produced coal worth $4 billion a year, or about a tenth of India’s total production. Despite the ban, many mines continued operatihere, requiring workers, often children, to descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders and dig coal out of narrow, horizontal seams. The unsuccessful rescue bid has drawn criticism of a lack of urgency shown by government agencies, particularly given the remote location of the mine, a journey to which can take more than five hours from the nearest commercial airport in Guwahati. “Would we have cared more if the miners had not been at the fringes of national consciousness in the northeast?” senior journalist Vir Sanghvi asked on Twitter. “I have not given up hope, but our response to this crisis shames us as a nation.” Additional reporting by Zarir Hussain in GUWAHATI; Writing by Krishna N.

" Israeli paramilitary police dragged dozens of Jewish settlers out of an illegal outpost in the occupied West Bank on Thursday and said more than 20 officers were hurt during violent resistance to the evacuation. Settlers had set up two caravans at the Amona outpost last month, in what they described as a protest against a recent surge in Palestinian attacks in the West Bank. Two years ago, Amona’s 300 settlers were removed by police after the Supreme Court ruled it had been built illegally and without Israeli government authorisation on privately-owned Palestinian land in 1995. Police said that in Thursday’s operation, which lasted several hours, at least 23 officers were injured by stones thrown by the settlers, many of them teenagers, or in scuffles, and were taken to hospital for treatment. Israeli media reports said at least three settlers were also hurt. At least seven people were arrested for attacking officers, police said. The evacuation was carried out after the Jerusalem District Court on Wednesday denied the settlers’ petition against eviction. Most countries consider all Israeli settlements on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war to be illegal. Israel disputes this, and last week Israeli authorities issued approvals for more than 2,000 settler homes in the West Bank. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which was also captured by Israel in the 1967 conflict. The two areas are home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. While Israel’s settlement projects have regularly drawn condemnation from the Palestinians and in Europe, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has taken a largely uncritical public stand.

" Thailand canceled flights to a popular tourist island, battened down beachside resorts and evacuated offshore oil rigs as the first tropical storm in nearly 30 years menaced its southern shores on Thursday. Tropical storm Pabuk approached southern Thailand with winds of up to 65 kph (40 mph), bringing high waves and gusty winds ahead of its expected landfall on Friday. Bangkok Airways canceled all flights to and from popular holiday destination Koh Samui, potentially stranding tourists. Media also reported that ferry services to and from the island were suspended. The Thai Meteorological Department warned of heavy downpours and strong winds in several provinces, including those with popular island destinations such as Samui, Phuket and Krabi. Some hotel operators reported a few early checkouts and said they were prepared. “Since the morning we have prepared sand bunkers and we have barricaded glass windows. We have also prepared first aid kits, torches, water, food and fuel for the hotel’s power generator,” said Ampawan Taopheng, manager of Lub D Koh Samui on Chaweng Beach. She added that other hotel operators had made similar preparations.

" Four tourists from Sweden and Finland were still missing on Thursday, a day after they were feared to have been swept away by an avalanche in Arctic Norway, police said. The avalanche occurred on Wednesday in the northern Norwegian region of Troms in an area popular with skiers. Three Finns and a Swede were skiing in the area and were reported to police as missing at around 1500 GMT, police said. Weather conditions did not allow rescue crew to continue their work on Thursday, although the searches were not called off. “The snow mass is huge. There is a high risk of triggering a new avalanche ... and there is a small storm in the area,” Troms Police Chief Astrid Elisabeth Nilsen told a news conference. Ski tracks were spotted going into the avalanche but not coming out. “Police assume that the four were taken by the avalanche,” Troms police said in a statement earlier on Thursday.",0
" Opposition members of Bangladesh’s parliament boycotted a swearing-in ceremony on Thursday, after rejecting results of a general election that they said was rigged to give Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina her third straight term. Hasina’s ruling alliance won more than 90 percent of the seats contested in Sunday’s election, which was marred by accusations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 17 people. Hasina and her ruling Awami League party have dismissed the accusations. While newly elected members of parliament from the ruling bloc, including Hasina, were sworn in, the seven opposition members stayed away. “Why should we take the oath when we’ve rejected this election?” Mirza Fakhrul Islam, secretary general of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), told reporters. Islam is one of the seven opposition members who won a seat. Hasina has denied any election impropriety, calling it a peaceful vote that saw enthusiastic participation. The Election Commission has rejected an opposition call for a new vote, but despite that, the opposition alliance on Thursday submitted a new demand for a re-run of the polls. “Our each and every candidate will file a case with the election tribunal in their respective seats rejecting the results and bringing allegations of vote fraud,” Islam said. The BNP, which boycotted the previous election, in 2014, has been hobbled by the absence of its leader, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, 74, who was jailed in February on corruption charges her party says were politically motivated. The party has asked the government for permission to meet Khaleda. Western governments, including the United States and the European Union, have condemned the election-day violence and called for investigation of a range of irregularities. On Thursday, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the run-up to the vote was characterised by “violence and intimidation against the opposition ... and the misuse of laws to limit free speech”. It called for an independent and impartial investigation of the accusations of electoral abuses. “Reports of ballot stuffing, intimidation of voters, and ruling party control of voting locations on election day mean that an independent and impartial commission should be formed to determine the extent of the violations,” Brad Adams, Asia director at the rights group, said in a statement. Hasina, whose father, state founder Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in a coup in 1975, has alternated in and out of power for nearly three decades with her main rival, Khaleda. Khaleda was first lady when her husband, Ziaur Rahman, was president from 1977 until he was assassinated in 1981.",0
" Lion Air has ended its search for the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) from its Boeing 737 MAX jet that crashed into the Java Sea in October, but Indonesian investigators said they plan to launch their own probe as soon as possible. The crash, the world’s first of a Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018, killed all 189 people on board. Contact with flight JT610 was lost 13 minutes after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital Jakarta heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang. The main wreckage and the CVR, one of two so-called black boxes, were not recovered in an initial search. Lion Air said in December it was funding a 38 billion rupiah ($2.64 million) search using the offshore supply ship MPV Everest. The search using the ship ended on Saturday, Danang Mandala, the spokesman for Lion Air Group, told Reuters. A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Commission (KNKT), however, said on Thursday the agency would start its own search for the black box as soon as feasible. The CVR is likely to hold vital clues that could give investigators insight into the actions of the pilots. The KNKT spokesman said negotiations with the Indonesian navy were under way to use a navy ship to relaunch the search for the second black box as soon as possible. “It might be as soon as next week. It won’t be as fancy as the (Lion-subsidized) MPV Everest but will be equipped with a CVR detector and we already have a remote-operated vehicle,” the commission’s spokesman said. The clock is ticking in the hunt for acoustic pings from the L3 Technologies Inc CVR fitted to the jet. It has a 90-day beacon, the manufacturer’s online brochure shows. A preliminary report by KNKT focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash. “While we appreciate the fact Lion Air Group brought out the MPV Everest ship, we are disappointed because there’s no actual results,” Anton Sahadi, a relative of a victim of the plane crash, told Reuters by a text message. “It has been a waste of money, of time and of a sophisticated ship ... for several weeks, we the families of victims were given only fake promises by Lion Air,” he said, adding he was not confident in the government’s efforts. The family of the Indonesian co-pilot of the flight filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Friday against Boeing in Chicago, adding to litigation piling up against the planemaker. [L1N1YX156] The lawsuit alleges that the Lion Air-operated Boeing 737 MAX jet was unreasonably dangerous because its sensors provided inconsistent information to both the pilots and the aircraft. At least two other lawsuits have been filed against Boeing in Chicago by relatives of victims. There has also been some debate among experts over Indonesian authorities’ decision to ask Lion Air to pay for the search that ended on Saturday. Safety experts say air accident investigation agencies typically lead the search for black boxes with public funding to ensure the independence of the process and that it is unusual to hand the task to one of the parties to the investigation. Indonesian investigators previously said that bureaucratic wrangling and funding problems had hampered the search for the Lion Air CVR and they had turned to the airline for help. In 2007, efforts to recover the black boxes from a crashed Adam Air jet were delayed by disagreements between the Indonesia and the airline over who should bear the cost. ($1 = 14,405.0000 rupiah)",0
" Troops and air strikes have killed more than 280 Boko Haram militants since the Niger government started an operation against the group last week, the defence ministry said. Boko Haram has attacked Niger, Chad and Cameroon from its base in northeast Nigeria, where it has been fighting for more than nine years to carve out an Islamist caliphate. Niger’s defence ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that the army mounted a sweep operation against the group last Friday along the southeastern Komadugu river, which separates Niger from Nigeria. More than 200 militants were “neutralized” by air strikes and 87 were killed by Nigerien troops on the ground, it said. In June 2016, more than 30 Nigerien soldiers were killed during a Boko Haram attack on the town of Bosso, prompting Chad to send 2,000 troops to help its West African neighbour counter the militants. Those troops were withdrawn in October 2017, raising concern about security in the Diffa region.",0
" A special tribunal in Afghanistan convicted three men involved in the murder of a BBC journalist shot dead in eastern province of Khost last year, officials said on Thursday. Ahmad Shah, who worked for the BBC’s Pashto language service as well as for Reuters, was killed by unidentified gunmen while he was on his way home last April. The BBC said Shah was its fifth staff member to have been killed in Afghanistan since the early 1990s. The Special Anti-Terrorism Tribunal sentenced one of the convicted men to death and the others were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. The case has been now been sent to a higher court to validate the tribunal’s ruling, Jamshid Rasouly, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office said. As defence lawyers were not immediately available for comment, it was unknown whether they would challenge the verdict or seek a fresh trial in the higher court. The Taliban denied having any role in Shah’s killing. He died on the same day that two bombs in Kabul killed 26 people, of whom nine were journalists and photographers, making it the deadliest day for media workers in Afghanistan. The Islamic State(IS), a hardline militant Islamic group claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks. Afghanistan was the world’s deadliest place for journalists in 2018, with 15 killed there over the year, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in December 2018.",0
" Italy’s foreign ministry knows nothing about reports that a North Korean diplomat, until recently ambassador to Italy, has gone missing and is seeking asylum in the West, a senior diplomatic source said on Thursday. A separate diplomatic source said the foreign ministry had no indication that the diplomat, Jo Song Gil, had sought asylum in Italy. The source added that North Korea had announced in late 2018 that it was sending a new envoy to Rome. “It was a perfectly normal procedure,” the source said. Earlier on Thursday, in Seoul, a South Korean lawmaker who was briefed by the National Intelligence Service said the diplomat had disappeared with his wife after leaving the Italian embassy without notice in early November.",0
" The European Union is not trying to keep Britain in and wants to start discussing future ties the moment the UK parliament approves Brexit, partly to focus on its own unity ahead of May elections, the head of the bloc’s executive said. “It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention. All we want is clarity about our future relations. And we respect the result of the referendum.” Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in an interview. Juncker said the EU was ready to start negotiating a new deal with Britain right after the British parliament approves the divorce deal. A vote is now due in the week starting Jan. 14. He also said Britain should get its act together. “And then tell us what it is you want,” he said. “I am working on the assumption that it will leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided,” he added, refusing to be drawn into whether Britain would hold a second Brexit vote. “That is for the British to decide.” On other challenges facing Europe, Juncker said he was watching closely U.S. President Donald Trump on trade. “I trust him for as long as he keeps his word. And if he no longer keeps it, then I will no longer feel bound by my word either,” Juncker said of tensions between the EU and Washington around car tariffs. He said he felt EU citizens were increasingly growing apart, another problem to tackle ahead of Europe-wide parliamentary elections in May. “We have to ensure that these rifts do not become too deep,” Juncker said. “We must not imply that the populists are right ... they are just loud and do not have any specific proposals to offer on solving the challenges of our time.” He said Europe had to stand united “in combating the trolls and hacker groups from China or Russia” that could seek to sway the European vote. He expressed doubt about EU state Romania, which takes over the bloc’s rotating presidency from Jan. 1, but struggles with corruption and bitter divisions. “The government in Bucharest has not yet fully understood what it means to take chair over the EU Member States ... Romania’s internal situation is such that the country cannot act as a compact unit in Europe,” Juncker said.

" U.S. commanders planning for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria are recommending that Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, four U.S. officials said, a move that would likely anger NATO ally Turkey. Three of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the recommendations were part of discussions on a draft plan by the U.S. military. It is unclear what the Pentagon will ultimately recommend to the White House. Discussions are still at an early stage inside the Pentagon and no decision has yet been made, the officials said. The plan will then be presented to the White House in the coming days with U.S. President Donald Trump making the final decision. The Pentagon said it would be “inappropriate” and premature to comment on what will happen with the weapons. “Planning is ongoing, and focused on executing a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of forces while taking all measures possible to ensure our troops’ safety,” said Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.The White House did not comment. Trump last week abruptly ordered a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, drawing widespread criticism and prompting Defence Secretary Jim Mattis’ resignation. The U.S. officials said Trump’s announcement has upset U.S. commanders, who view his decision as a betrayal of the Kurdish YPG militia, which has led the fight to eradicate Islamic State from northeastern Syria. Ankara views the YPG as an extension of a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey. Turkey has threatened to launch an offensive against the YPG, raising fears of a surge in violence that could harm hundreds of thousands of civilians. The United States told the YPG that they would be armed by Washington until the fight against Islamic State was completed, one of the U.S. officials said. “The fight isn’t over. We can’t simply start asking for the weapons back,” said the official. The proposal to leave U.S.-supplied weapons with the YPG, which could include anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles and mortars, would reassure Kurdish allies that they were not being abandoned. But Turkey wants the United States to take the weapons back, so the commanders’ recommendation, if confirmed, could complicate Trump’s plan to allow Turkey to finish off the fight against Islamic State inside Syria. The Pentagon keeps records of the weapons it has supplied to the YPG and their chain of custody. But, the U.S. officials said, it would be nearly impossible to locate all of the equipment. “How are we going to get them back and who is going to take them back?” one of the officials asked. The debate over whether to leave weapons with the YPG coincides with Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton’s visit to Turkey and Israel next week for talks on Syria. In May 2017, the United States started distributing arms and equipment to the YPG for an offensive against Raqqa, the de facto capital of the self-declared caliphate that Islamic State overran in Iraq and Syria in 2014. The United States told Turkey that it would take back the weapons after the defeat of Islamic State, which has lost all but a few slivers of territory in northeastern Syria. “The idea that we’d be able to recover them is asinine. So we leave them where they are,” said a U.S. official. A person familiar with the discussions of the U.S. withdrawal plan said the White House and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan would oppose the proposal to allow the YPG to keep its U.S.-supplied weapons. The recommendation “is a rejection of Trump’s policy to withdraw from Syria,” said the person, who asked not to be further identified. Turkey has said weapons supplied to the YPG have in the past ended up in the hands of its Kurdish separatists, and described any weapon given to the insurgents as a threat to Turkey’s security. A phone call between Trump and Erdogan led to the decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria. In the call two weeks ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, U.S. officials said. Instead, in the course of the conversation, Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Turkey the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.",0
" Residents of the Indian capital of New Delhi woke on Thursday to a thick, gray smog, as pollution surged to “severe” and “emergency” levels, with authorities showing little sign of finding new solutions to the crisis. The air quality index of the state-run Central Pollution Control Board showing the concentration of poisonous particulate matter known as PM 2.5 stood at 440, up from 430 on Wednesday, and about 12 times the U.S. government recommended level of 35. Pollution levels hit 500 in some parts of New Delhi, with very poor visibility in some areas. Last year, the high was 450 on Dec. 23. “Climatic conditions have contributed to the crisis, but let’s admit that most steps announced in 2018 have failed miserably,” said Sunil Dahiya, a senior campaigner with environmental group Greenpeace. A sharp drop in temperatures and wind speed, combined with vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites and smoke from garbage burning has boosted pollution over much of north India, including New Delhi, home to more than 20 million. A spokesman for the federal government was not immediately available to comment. The city government refused to comment. Both the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal’s Delhi government have not announced any measures to fight pollution this year. Cold weather has forced some people, especially those spending the night in the open, to burn small fires to keep warm, adding to the smog. Unfavorable weather conditions have worsened the crisis, but government measures have also failed to improve air quality in New Delhi and elsewhere. As pollution spiked in the city in October and November, the government adopted measures ranging from a temporary ban on construction activities and garbage burning to a clampdown on polluting industrial plants, such as coal-fired power stations. Critics say the measures were inadequate and poorly implemented, largely because of a lack of resources and political will to fight the toxic air, which has driven a spurt in patients battling pollution-related health issues. India is home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities, with Delhi the sixth worst, the World Health Organization said in a report this year. Toxic air claimed 1.24 million lives in India last year, or 12.5 percent of total deaths, a study published in Lancet Planetary Health showed this month. “India cuts a sorry figure because of the reports from international bodies,” said Dahiya. “If a country fails to give clean air to its people, agencies like the WHO and Lancet will talk about it.” Editing by Martin Howell and Clarence Fernandez All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" China’s top prosecutor said on Thursday that two Canadians detained after Canada arrested a Chinese technology company executive had “without a doubt” violated the law. Authorities in Beijing had previously said the two men, Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor, were suspected of endangering state security. “Without a doubt, these two Canadian citizens in China violated our country’s laws and regulations, and are currently undergoing investigation according to procedure,” Zhang Jun, China’s prosecutor general, said. Zhang said the investigation process had been handled “strictly” according to law when asked by Reuters at a briefing when the two men might be charged. He did not elaborate. The two were detained after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1 in Vancouver, at the request of the United States. U.S. prosecutors have accused her of misleading banks about transactions linked to Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating sanctions. The Chinese government has only given vague details about the detention of the two Canadians, and it has not drawn a direct link to Meng’s arrest. It has demanded that Canada free her and threatened unspecified consequences if it does not. Canada has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor. But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they have no doubt the cases are linked. Canada has said the detentions are unacceptable and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said China should free the men. Under Chinese criminal procedure law, special forms of detention and interrogation can be used for state security suspects. China touts the rule of law, but its judicial system is tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party. Rights groups say conditions in Chinese detention facilities are often basic and can be harsh, with lack of legal representation and due process compounding worries about treatment.",0
" Thirteen civilians have been killed in ethnic violence in central Burkina Faso, the government said on Wednesday, echoing a rise in inter-communal conflicts in neighbouring Mali linked to Islamist violence. Burkina has seen a spike in Islamist attacks in recent months as jihadists seek to increase their influence across the Sahel. On Dec. 31, the government declared a state of emergency in several northern provinces bordering Mali. Attacks this week show how that violence may be fuelling ethnic clashes for the first time in Burkina. After nightfall on Dec. 31, armed men on motorbikes descended on the village of Yirgou, made up largely of people of Mossi ethnicity, and killed six people, including the village chief, government spokesman Jean Paul Badoun said. The following day, Badoun said, Yirgou residents killed seven Fulani herders in apparent retaliation. The residents blamed the herders for sheltering the men who attacked them the day before. The ethnic violence echoes problems seen in neighbouring Mali where Fulani have been accused of hiding Islamists who have carried out attacks across the region in recent years. Armed men killed 37 Fulani civilians there on Tuesday. [nL8N1Z10KE] Ten gendarmes were shot dead near the Malian border last week in an attack claimed by Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an umbrella group for al Qaeda-linked militants in the Sahara. JNIM claimed responsibility for other attacks this year, including one in the capital Ouagadougou in March that killed about eight security agents and wounded dozens of others. Thousands of people have fled their homes due to the attacks and reprisals by security forces.",0
" Patrick Shanahan was thrust into the spotlight during his debut as acting U.S. defence secretary on Wednesday, sitting next to President Donald Trump as he publicly disparaged Shanahan’s predecessor, lampooned the war in Afghanistan and called Syria a land of “sand” and “death.” The former deputy defence secretary officially took office during the New Year’s holiday on Tuesday, issuing a statement saying that he looked “forward to working with President Trump to carry out his vision.” Trump’s vision for the second half of his four-year term in office came into view on Wednesday as he spoke exhaustively during a cabinet meeting about America’s wars, and his displeasure with them. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, sat silently at Trump’s side, often expressionless, as television cameras rolled. Trump suggested that former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis - who abruptly resigned last month over policy differences with Trump - had been essentially fired and that Mattis had failed in Afghanistan, where Taliban insurgents are becoming increasingly confident of ending the 17-year-old war on terms favourable to them. “I’m not happy with what he’s done in Afghanistan and I shouldn’t be happy,” Trump said. The remarks put Shanahan in a difficult position from the start of what could be a long tenure at the Pentagon, where many staff were loyal to Mattis. Trump has suggested Shanahan could be acting as defence secretary for an extended period of time. Several candidates previously seen as potential successors to Mattis have recently indicated they don’t want the job, officials say. Mattis’ public resignation could also make Senate confirmation perilous for any hand-picked successor. Mattis implicitly criticized Trump in his resignation letter for failing to value allies who fight alongside the United States, including in places like Syria. Even Shanahan had been picked by Mattis for the deputy job and held him in high regard, officials say. As deputy, Shanahan often had to fill in for Mattis in meetings, including those with cabinet members. One reason Mattis resigned was Trump’s surprise decision to order the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria. Although Trump has declared victory there, critics warn Islamic State still has a toehold, and could stage a comeback if U.S. forces depart. Trump said during the cabinet meeting that Islamic State militants should be combated by nations in the region, including U.S. adversary Iran. “It’s sand and it’s death,” he said. Shanahan has yet to detail his thoughts on the way forward in Syria, where the Pentagon plans a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops over the coming months. He has also not commented on planning for a dramatic drawdown in Afghanistan. Seth Jones at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington said Shanahan started the job from a somewhat weaker position, as he did not have the mandate of having been confirmed by the Senate. “Second, the president has made major decisions on a range of these (national security) issues,” Jones said. In one of his first meetings of the day, Shanahan told civilian leaders of the U.S. military to focus on “China, China, China,” even as America fights militants in Syria and Afghanistan, a U.S. defence official said. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not elaborate on Shanahan’s views on China or other guidance he gave. Other officials have described Shanahan as an advocate of the Pentagon's toughening stance towards Beijing. The 2018 National Defense Strategy here, which Shanahan helped develop, branded China as a strategic competitor. “While we’re focussed on ongoing operations, acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to remember China, China, China,” the official said. Relations between the world’s two largest economies have plumbed new depths under Trump, with a trade war and disagreements over Taiwan and the South China Sea. In Beijing on Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesman said China valued relations between the militaries of the two countries. “If what we mutually seek is a partner, then we will likely get a partner. If what we seek is an adversary, then we will certainly get an adversary,” Lu Kang told a regular news briefing, when asked about Shanahan’s remarks. Shanahan, best known for his focus on internal Pentagon reform and his private-sector experience, had spent three decades at Boeing and was general manager for the 787 Dreamliner passenger jet before he joined the Pentagon. During Shanahan’s tense Senate confirmation hearing in 2017, the committee’s then-chairman, John McCain, voiced deep concern about giving the deputy job to an executive from one of the five corporations accounting for the lion’s share of U.S. defence spending. “I have to have confidence that the fox is not going to be put back into the henhouse,” said McCain, who died in August. Shanahan has recused himself from participating in Boeing-related issues, a spokesman said.",0
" China reported an outbreak of deadly African swine fever on a huge pig farm part-owned by a Danish investment fund, showing the spread of the virus to modern industrial farms expected to have the best levels of disease prevention. The outbreak occurred on a farm in Suihua city with 73,000 pigs in northeastern Heilongjiang province, owned by the Heilongjiang Asia-Europe Animal Husbandry Co Ltd, a company established in 2016. The farm’s herd included 15,000 breeding pigs, according to its website, and it was aiming to produce 385,000 pigs for slaughter a year. Some 4,686 pigs had been infected and 3,766 animals died, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said late on Wednesday. All animals on infected farms must be culled under current rules. The farm is the largest yet to be hit by the disease, which has infected almost 100 farms across China since August 2018, spreading faster than in any other country to date. More than 200,000 pigs on infected farms have been culled, according to a Reuters tally of official figures, while hundreds of thousands more in the vicinity have also been put down. China has the world’s largest hog herd and the rapid spread of African swine fever has roiled the country’s trade in pork, the nation’s most popular meat, disrupting supplies and pushing up prices in some areas. Neither Heilongjiang Asia-Europe Animal Husbandry nor its majority owner, state-owned Zhejiang Rural Development Group Co. Ltd, responded to calls for comment. Steffen Schiottz-Christensen, vice president for North Asia at Denmark state fund IFU, confirmed the outbreak but declined to comment further as he had yet to be fully briefed. IFU, which provides risk capital and advice for investment in developing countries, invested 28.4 million DKK (3.44 million pounds) in the farm in 2017, according to its website, although its shareholding has since been diluted, Schiottz-Christensen said. “The African swine fever situation is only getting worse. Small farms, big farms, slaughterhouses, feed - the whole production chain basically all got hit,” said Yao Guiling, an analyst with consultancy China-America Commodity Data Analytics. Beijing has banned feeding kitchen waste to pigs, and restricted transport of live pigs and products from infected areas. But the virus has now reached 23 provinces and municipalities across China. The disease is deadly to pigs but does not affect humans. “The policies are good, but the increasing outbreaks show that there might be some problem with execution at the local government level,” said Yao. China’s agriculture ministry also said on Wednesday that slaughterhouses will need to test their pork products for African swine fever before selling them to the market. Slaughterhouses must slaughter pigs from different origins separately, and can only sell the products if blood from the same batch of pigs tests negative for the virus. If the virus is detected, slaughterhouses must cull all pigs to be slaughtered and suspend operations for at least 48 hours, according to the regulation, which will go into effect from Feb. 1.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had received a “great” letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and would probably meet him again in the not-too-distant future as part of efforts to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump defended stuttering U.S. negotiations with Kim, saying that if it had not been for his administration “you’d be having a nice big fat war in Asia.” He reiterated that there was no hurry. “I’m not in any rush. I don’t have to rush. All I know is there’s no rockets, there’s no testing,” he said, referring to North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests that have been halted since the second half of 2017. Trump said he had watched coverage of Kim’s New Year speech on the U.S. Public Broadcasting Service. “They said that in Chairman Kim’s speech he really wants to get together, he wants to denuclearize and a lot of good things are happening,” Trump said. “They really do want to do something. Now, does that mean it’s going to be done? Who knows? A deal’s a deal, you never know, but I tell you, we’ve established a very good relationship with North Korea.” “We’ll probably now have another meeting. He’d like to meet, I’d like to meet,” Trump said. “We’ll set that up, we’ll be setting that up in the not-too-distant future.” Kim vowed to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula when he met Trump for the first time at a summit in Singapore in June, but there has been little concrete progress since. Kim said in a nationally televised New Year address on Tuesday that he was ready to meet again with Trump anytime, but warned he may take a “new path” if U.S. sanctions and pressure continued. Trump, who in 2017 threatened to rain “fire and fury like the world has never seen” on North Korea because of the threat its nuclear weapons and missiles posed to the United States, said a world war had been averted. “That was going to be a war - there could have been a World War Three to be honest with you ... And instead, we have somebody who I really think wants to get on to economic development and making a lot of success and money, frankly, for his country.” Trump said North Korea had “tremendous” potential, and added: “We’ll help them out too.” On Monday, South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported that Kim had sent a message to Trump regarding the stalled nuclear talks. The report did not include details about the “letter-like” communication. Trump told reporters on Wednesday the letter was “great” and that he would love to read it out loud, but did not do so. Trump has said previously that a second summit with Kim was likely in January or February, though he wrote on Twitter last month he was “in no hurry.” In his address on Tuesday, Kim said denuclearization was his “firm will” and North Korea had “declared at home and abroad that we would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them.” However, he warned that North Korea might be “compelled to explore a new path” to defend its sovereignty if the United States “seeks to force something upon us unilaterally ... and remains unchanged in its sanctions and pressure.” In spite of Trump’s words, Kim’s comments have fuelled doubts over whether North Korea intends to give up a nuclear weapons programme it has long considered essential to its security. Analysts said Kim’s message sent clear signals that North Korea, which has sought acceptance as a “responsible” nuclear power, was willing to stay in talks with Washington and Seoul this year - but on its own terms. North Korea’s main state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary on Thursday last year saw “wonderful changes” and “great movements” in North Korea’s relations with the South Korea and the United States, but progress in inter-Korean relations were “locked up in stagnation” because of U.S policies. “The U.S. still remains unchanged in the policy hostile towards the DPRK,” the paper wrote, using the initials of North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The paper accused the United States of having a “a sinister intention to deprive the DPRK of its nuclear weapons and bring it to its knees without goodwill to build a new, good relationship with the DPRK”. “The U.S. is urged to do what it should do for the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations, not making useless admonition while meddling in the issue of north-south relations, an internal issue of the Korean nation,” it said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made several trips to Pyongyang last year but the two sides have yet to reschedule an abruptly cancelled November meeting between him and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol aimed at paving the way for a second summit. As well as demanding a lifting of sanctions, Pyongyang has been seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War in response to its initial, unilateral steps that have included dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a missile engine facility. U.S. officials have said the extent of initial North Korean steps was not confirmed and could be easily reversed. Washington has halted some large-scale military exercises with South Korea to aid negotiations, but has called for strict global sanctions enforcement until North Korea’s full, verifiable denuclearization.",0
" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Tuesday he is ready to meet U.S. President Donald Trump again anytime to achieve their common goal of denuclearising the Korean Peninsula, but warned he may have to take an alternative path if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued. In a nationally televised New Year address, Kim said denuclearisation was his “firm will” and North Korea had “declared at home and abroad that we would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them.” Kim added that Pyongyang had “taken various practical measures” and if Washington responded “with trustworthy measures and corresponding practical actions ... bilateral relations will develop wonderfully at a fast pace.” “I am always ready to sit together with the U.S. president anytime in the future, and will work hard to produce results welcomed by the international community without fail,” Kim said. However, he warned that North Korea might be “compelled to explore a new path” to defend its sovereignty if the United States “seeks to force something upon us unilaterally ... and remains unchanged in its sanctions and pressure.” It was not clear what Kim meant by “a new path,” but his comments are likely to further fuel scepticism over whether North Korea intends to give up a nuclear weapons programme that it has long considered essential to its security. In response to the news, Trump wrote on Twitter, “I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential!” There was no immediate comment from the White House. Asked for a reaction, a U.S. State Department official said: “We decline the opportunity to comment.” South Korea’s presidential office, however, welcomed Kim’s speech, saying it carried his “firm will” to advance relations with Seoul and Washington. Kim and Trump vowed to work towards denuclearisation and build “lasting and stable” peace at their landmark summit in Singapore in June, but little progress has been made since. Trump has said a second summit with Kim is likely in January or February, though he wrote on Twitter last month that he was “in no hurry.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made several trips to Pyongyang last year but the two sides have yet to reschedule a meeting between him and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol after an abrupt cancellation in November. Pyongyang has demanded Washington lift sanctions and declare an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War in response to its initial, unilateral steps towards denuclearisation, including dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility. U.S. officials have said the extent of initial North Korean steps were not confirmed and could be easily reversed. Washington has halted some large-scale military exercises with Seoul to aid negotiations, but has called for strict global sanctions enforcement on impoverished North Korea until its full, verifiable denuclearisation. Kim’s reference to pledges not to make nuclear weapons could indicate a first moratorium on such weapons production, although it was not clear if this was conditional. While Pyongyang conducted no nuclear or missile tests last year, satellite images have pointed to continued activity at related facilities. The U.S. special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, reiterated last month that Washington had no intention of easing sanctions but had agreed to help South Korea send flu medication to North Korea, saying such cooperation could help advance nuclear diplomacy. Analysts said Kim’s message sent clear signals that North Korea was willing to stay in talks with Washington and Seoul this year - but on its own terms. “North Korea seems determined in 2019 to receive some sort of sanctions relief ... The challenge, however, is will Team Trump be willing to back away from its position of zero sanctions relief?” said Harry Kazianis of the Washington-based Centre for the National Interest. “Kim’s remarks seem to suggest his patience with America is wearing thin.” After racing towards the goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States in 2017, Kim used last year’s New Year speech to warn that “a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office” and order mass production of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles. But he also offered to send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in the South in February, setting off a flurry of diplomacy that included three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and the meeting with Trump in June. This year, Kim said inter-Korean relations had entered a “completely new phase,” and offered to resume key inter-Korean economic projects banned under international and South Korean sanctions, without conditions.",0
" In his New Year address on Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned he might take a “new path” if Washington maintains sanctions amid his country’s push for economic development, but experts say it may be too late to change the trajectory of negotiations. Kim did not specify what the new approach might be. His warning may sound similar to the bellicose rhetoric that Pyongyang often deployed before last year’s summit, but he cannot jeopardise the hard-won thaw and has few options beyond appealing directly to U.S. President Donald Trump, experts say. State media have in recent weeks accused the State Department of risking returning to “exchanges of fire” of the past by ramping up sanctions, while crediting Trump for his efforts to continue talks. As both sides struggle to find a breakthrough in stalled talks, the speech shows Kim shifting the focus from calls for complete dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal and hinting at including countries other than the United States. A: Kim vowed to work towards denuclearisation at a summit with Trump in Singapore in June. But since then there has been little progress, with a high-level meeting between the two sides cancelled abruptly in November. Pyongyang has demanded Washington lift sanctions and declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War in response to the dismantlement of its Punggye-ri nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility. Despite goodwill responses from Washington, such as a halt of some major military exercises with South Korea, U.S. officials have said North Korea’s initial steps were not confirmed and could be easily reversed. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said North Korea would not be forced to provide a list of nuclear weapons and locations, and a U.S. nuclear envoy offered to facilitate humanitarian aid. But Kim’s speech on Tuesday called for a “complete end” to all joint exercises and slammed the sanctions campaign. “His message was ‘we have done what we said we would at Singapore, but the United States has done very little in return,’” said Vipin Narang, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A: North Korea’s state media has stepped up criticism of the United States, warning of a return to the era of confrontation if sanctions and pressure continued. But that indicates Pyongyang’s frustration rather than the “new path” Kim suggested, experts say. “One thing is clear: Kim is not going to return to any sort of posture where the U.S. or its allies would consider a military attack, and that means no missile or nuclear tests for the foreseeable future,” said Harry Kazianis of the Washington-based Centre for the National Interest. Instead, “new path” may refer to focussing on concessions that don’t involve broad denuclearisation in favour of action-for-action commitments. South Korea’s Unification Ministry said on Wednesday it could not speculate on what the alternative path might be, but Kim showed his “clear resolve” to abandon the weapons programme and improve U.S. ties by mentioning “complete denuclearisation” himself for the first time. Kim Joon-hyung, a professor at Handong Global University, said one possible scenario was the North’s dismantling of the Yongbyon nuclear complex, as offered at an inter-Korean summit in September in Pyongyang, and acknowledging some facilities in return for eased sanctions, such as a partial restart of inter-Korean economic projects. Kim Jong Un said in the speech he was willing to reopen the Kaesong factory park and allow access to the North’s Mount Kumgang resort “without conditions.” Yet there remains an opportunity to limit Kim’s arsenal, said Patrick Cronin of the Hudson Institute in Washington. “This will not be easy, and neither side will achieve outright success, but diplomacy is possible,” Cronin said. “China and others may also be invited to play a role.” A: The New Year address called for a launch of multilateral talks to officially declare an end to the Korean War, an idea also floated previously by South Korea. That could mean working with China, South Korea and others in pressing Washington, professor Kim said. But other experts, including former South Korean nuclear envoy Lee Soo-hyuk, were sceptical that would happen given the deadlocked bilateral talks, the Sino-U.S. trade war and Trump’s dislike for multinational mechanisms. “Kim can present Trump with a choice: Either play ball with me on a negotiated nuclear settlement and reduce sanctions or I will go to China for help and get the economic development I want and keep my nukes,” Kazianis said.",0
" No agreement came out of a meeting between U.S. congressional leaders and President Donald Trump on Wednesday to end a partial government shutdown now in its 12th day as the president stuck to his demand for $5 billion (3.97 billion pounds) in border wall funding fiercely opposed by Democrats. Congressional leaders are expected to return to the White House on Friday to resume talks, signalling the shutdown will likely stretch into the weekend. The White House convened the meeting to try to convince Democrats that funding a wall on the southern border with Mexico was a pressing security need. Instead, Democratic leaders cut off Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen’s presentation and tried to no avail to press Trump to accept their offer. “It just was not a credible presentation,” Senator Dick Durbin said of the briefing. He added that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be elected House speaker on Thursday, insisted the conversation focus instead on the shutdown. Pelosi said the House would proceed with plans to hold votes on Thursday, when they formally take control of the chamber from Trump’s fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing the wall money sought by Trump. “We’re asking the president to open up government,” Pelosi told reporters outside the White House after the meeting. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward on the Senate floor that the chamber would not vote on the legislation, calling it a “political sideshow” and “total nonstarter.” Democrats say they want to fund most of the government through September, but allow for another month to negotiate wall funding by only partially funding the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the wall. Schumer said Trump conceded that Republicans would lose leverage if they allowed the rest of the government to be funded. “We asked him to give us one good reason ... why you should continue your shutdown of the eight Cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security. He could not give a good answer,” Schumer told reporters after the meeting. In a tweet on Wednesday evening, Trump called the meeting “important” and said he would continue talks with Democrats “to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.” Trump’s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers. Before meeting with lawmakers, Trump said the shutdown would last for “as long as it takes” as he pushes for wall money as part of any legislation to reopen agencies shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec. 22. “It could be a long time,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting, “or it could be quickly.” “We know that we have a challenge along the border,” said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican. “We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well.” Pelosi noted that the legislation being presented in the House had previously won backing in the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands in the new 2019-2020 Congress that convenes on Thursday. But McConnell said previously that Senate Republicans would not approve a spending measure Trump does not support. Trump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats, Trump called the border a “sieve,” rebutted Pelosi’s complaint that a wall was immoral, provided an estimate of the U.S. illegal immigrant population far higher than the figures most experts cite and made disputed comments about progress towards building a wall. The visit by Pelosi and Schumer was their first to the White House since their sharp exchange with Trump in the Oval Office on Dec. 11 during which the president told them he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security.” He has since blamed Democrats for the shutdown. The $5 billion Trump is seeking would cover only a portion of the money needed for a border wall, a project estimated to cost about $23 billion. Trump had said Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico has refused.",0
" As Ralph Snake walked across Washington’s National Mall on Wednesday, he stopped every few feet to pick up litter that has accumulated in the once-tidy expanse of grass since a budget showdown partially closed the federal government 12 days ago. “I decided to clean up this one section, because that’s what Americans will do,” said Snake, a 64-year-old member of the indigenous Ho-Chunk Nation in Wisconsin. Snake came to the U.S. capital to witness Sharice Davids get sworn in as one of the first two women of native American descent to become members of Congress. The partial shutdown, which has cut off many government services, entered its 12th day on Wednesday with no end in sight. It stems from an impasse between congressional Democrats, who control the House of Representatives as of Thursday, and President Donald Trump, who is demanding $5.6 billion (4.5 billion pounds) in funding for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. National parks have closed campgrounds out of fear that toilets will overflow with human waste. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are working without pay. The immigration court system, already suffocating under a backlog, is largely shuttered. The prospects for an end to the showdown remained unclear, even as congressional leaders visited the White House on Wednesday. In Washington, the 17 museums run by the Smithsonian as well as the National Zoo closed their doors on Wednesday after running out of emergency funding, leaving tourists frustrated with politicians of both parties. “It’s stupid,” said Laura Vanbragt, a 20-year-old student from Grand Rapids, Michigan. “There should just be more communication between the two, more give on both sides.” Outside the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Clint Woods and his family stood waiting for a guided tour with other visitors who were locked out of more popular venues. “It’s like two squabbling children,” Woods, 43, said of Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress. “They both think they’re right, and they’re dug in.” At Joshua Tree National Park, which is named after the spiked yucca plants that grow all over the park’s desert landscape, roads and scenic turnouts were full of cars on Wednesday but campgrounds were closed. Rock climbers Kiera Waskey, 21, and Stefan Nelson, 22, were able to camp in the park for three nights after arriving on a visit from Minnesota. “We were told that today we had to clean up camp and we can’t camp here anymore, which was a bummer,” Waskey said, standing near rock outcroppings dotted by several climbers. “I guess we take it for granted almost, these beautiful places that we have and we never thought we’d have to prepare for it (the shutdown),” he said. Public bathrooms and trash bins at the park were well kept, because volunteers were cleaning them, visitors said. The booth at the park’s entrance was closed, so visitors were able to roll in without paying an entrance fee. Frequent park visitors Marie Hoffman and Trevor Goodman, who are both 19 and students at University of California, Davis, said they noticed a lot more climbers and general visitor than they normally see at the park. “It looks like Disneyland today with just all the cars and everything, so many visitors,” Hoffman said, attributing the increased traffic to the temporary lack of an entrance fee. Unlike in some previous government shutdowns, many national parks have remained open, though without staff to collect trash and service restrooms. Advocates have voiced alarm that an extended shutdown could cause environmental damage. “We’re very concerned about the reports we’re seeing of human waste in inappropriate places,” said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriations for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Trash is a serious concern for wildlife.” The impact of the shutdown has reached the nation’s 62 immigration courts as well. Hundreds of judges are on furlough, and only cases of immigrants in detention are being heard. The Trump administration has expanded the system, which is run by the U.S. Department of Justice, aiming to cut down on the backlog of more than 800,000 cases, but the shutdown will complicate that effort, said Ashley Tabaddor, the president of the national immigration judges’ union. “To reschedule these cases can take several years because the judges are all booked,” she said. A Justice Department spokesman said he could not respond to a request for comment because of the shutdown. Meanwhile, some 800,000 government workers are either furloughed or working without pay until the shutdown ends. Shekina Givens, a 32-year-old Transportation Security Administration officer in Atlanta and president of the local chapter of a union that represents government employees, said she is avoiding using her credit cards and putting off some expenses. “I’m the only person that’s working in my household and paying all the bills,” she said.",0
" Britain has recognised its sporting stars in the Queen’s New Year’s honours list with a knighthood for cricketer Alastair Cook, and awards for Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas, England soccer boss Gareth Southgate and his captain Harry Kane. Former England captain Cook, 34, who retired from international cricket this year, was his country’s most-capped test player and record test run scorer. Welsh cyclist Thomas, 32, has won three world championships and two Olympic gold medals along with this year’s Tour de France, while the honours for Southgate and Kane follow England’s World Cup run in Russia this Summer in which the team finished fourth, their best result since victory in 1966. The awards also include a damehood for model Lesley Lawson, better known as Twiggy, one of the defining faces of the swinging 1960s. Two members of the team who rescued 12 junior footballers and their coach from a flooded cave in Thailand, Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, received the George Medal for gallantry. A knighthood goes to writer Philip Pullman, whose books include the “His Dark Materials” trilogy, while “Gruffalo” children’s author Julia Donaldson, 70, is awarded a CBE. CBEs also go to Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti, 31, and actress Sophie Okonedo, 50. The New Year’s honours have been awarded since Queen Victoria’s reign in the 19th century and aim to recognise not just well-known figures but those who have contributed to national life through often selfless and unsung contributions over many years. In that spirit, an OBE for fighting gun and knife crime goes to Mark Prince, 49, whose son Kiyan was fatally stabbed outside his school aged 15 in May 2006, while 28-year-old Stephen Addison who set up boxing classes to channel young people’s energy away from crime is awarded the BEM. The biannual honours list is released on the Queen’s official birthday in June and at the end of each year. The list, along with a guide to the various awards, is published by the Cabinet Office and can be seen at www.gov.uk/honours/honours-lists.",0
" Peru Attorney General Pedro Chavarry on Wednesday reappointed two lead prosecutors he had dismissed from a high-profile graft probe after the decision sparked widespread opposition and a threat by President Martin Vizcarra to suspend him. The prosecutors, Rafael Vela and Jose Domingo Perez, had recently drawn up a plea deal with Odebrecht that committed the Brazilian construction company to providing evidence on some $30 million (23.9 million pounds) in bribes it says it paid to local politicians. The two are celebrated as anti-graft crusaders by many Peruvians for going after high-profile politicians, including four former presidents and opposition leader Keiko Fujimori. But late on Monday, Chavarry announced he was removing Vela and Perez from the case for exceeding their authority. By Wednesday, after protests and waves of criticism, Chavarry signed a resolution reappointing them to their posts, saying other prosecutors had declined to replace them. The reversal was a fresh win for President Vizcarra, who had promised to do all he could to return the two prosecutors to the case. Earlier on Wednesday Vizcarra sent Congress legislation to suspend Chavarry from his post and declare a state of emergency in the attorney general’s office in order to restructure it. Chavarry has denied that he sought to meddle in the Odebrecht probe by dismissing Perez and Vela. Vizcarra, who took office to replace former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski after his resignation due to a graft scandal last year, has made fighting corruption a core focus of his government. His approval rating at the end of 2018 exceeded 60 percent after reforms he proposed to uproot entrenched corruption cronyism easily passed a national referendum. Vizcarra has repeatedly called for Chavarry to step down, but under Peru’s constitution only Congress can force the attorney general from office. Odebrecht is at the centre of the “Car Wash” investigation in Brazil, which has rippled across Latin America and which U.S. prosecutors have said is the biggest political graft scheme ever uncovered. In 2016, Odebrecht acknowledged it had paid millions of dollars in bribes to officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts dating back over a decade. The company has committed to paying billions of dollars in fines.",0
" U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday the Senate will not consider bills Democrats plan to vote on in the House on Thursday that would end the government shutdown but not include President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion for a border wall. “The Senate will not waste its time considering a Democratic bill which cannot pass this chamber and which the president will not sign,” McConnell said on the Senate floor.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump’s attorney general nominee William Barr is expected to back away from prior criticism of an anti-fraud law that allows private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Barr will clarify his current thinking on the U.S. False Claims Act, which he has previously called an unconstitutional “abomination,” when he goes before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing in coming months, the source said. Barr did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his law firm email account. The law allows whistleblowers who expose fraud against the U.S. government to bring private lawsuits and keep a percentage of any damages awarded. In October, for example, the Justice Department agreed to a $93 million (73.9 million pounds) bounty for three whistleblowers after drug wholesaler AmerisouceBergen Corp paid $625 million to resolve their allegations of Medicaid fraud. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have criticized the False Claims Act (FCA) as primarily benefiting plaintiffs’ lawyers and their clients instead of taxpayers. But the Justice Department has raked in nearly $60 billion in FCA settlements and judgements since the law was overhauled in 1986, including nearly $3 billion last year. The law also still enjoys the strong support of Iowa Republican and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who was an architect of 1986 amendments that increased the FCA’s potency. In 1991, during Barr’s previous confirmation hearing to serve as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, Grassley explicitly asked Barr to pledge support to the FCA’s whistleblower provisions. As a high-ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration, Barr had authored a 1989 memorandum that concluded the law’s whistleblower provisions violated the separation of powers doctrine and other constitutional requirements. Barr later said in a 2001 interview for an oral history of the Bush presidency that he wanted the Justice Department to attack the constitutionality of the law but was opposed by then Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2000 that private whistleblowers can sue on behalf of the U.S. government. Barr has recently told others that his prior comments are outdated, according to the source. Barr believes DOJ’s current handling of FCA cases protects federal interests and no longer thinks a constitutional challenge is warranted, the source said. Grassley is expected to cede chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, before Barr’s confirmation hearing. He hailed President Trump’s nomination of Barr in a statement last month. Grassley’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.",0
" The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Wednesday it would hold confirmation hearings on Jan. 15 and 16 for Attorney General nominee William Barr, who has come under fire from Democrats for his criticism of the special counsel’s Russia probe. If confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Barr would take over from Matthew Whitaker, who has been serving as acting attorney general since President Donald Trump forced out Jeff Sessions in November. The committee’s statement did not give details on the planned hearings. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said last month that a memo Barr wrote criticizing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian interference in U.S. elections should disqualify him from serving as attorney general. Barr wrote in the June 2018 memo to senior Justice Department officials that Mueller “should not be able to demand that the President submit to an interrogation about alleged obstruction,” CNN has reported. As attorney general, Barr would oversee the Russia investigation. Trump has called the probe, which is examining any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, a witch hunt. Barr previously served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under late President George H.W. Bush.",0
" The United States wants an explanation for why Russia detained a former U.S. Marine on spying charges in Moscow and will demand his immediate return if it determines his detention is inappropriate, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman visited the detained man, Paul Whelan, at a detention facility in Moscow and spoke by phone with his family, the State Department said. The United States had expressed concern through diplomatic channels over delayed access to Whelan, who was detained on Friday, a department spokesman said in a statement. “We’ve made clear to the Russians our expectation that we will learn more about the charges, come to understand what it is he’s been accused of and if the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return,” Pompeo said in Brasilia, where he attended the inauguration of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday. Russia’s FSB state security service opened a criminal case against Whelan but it gave no details of his suspected espionage activities. Under Russian law, espionage can carry a prison sentence of between 10 and 20 years. Whelan’s family said on Tuesday that he was visiting Moscow for the wedding of a retired Marine and is innocent of the espionage charges against him. He had been staying with the wedding party at Moscow’s Metropol hotel when he went missing, his brother David said. “His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected,” Whelan’s family said in a statement. David Whelan told CNN that his brother, who had served in Iraq, has been to Russia many times in the past for both work and personal trips, and had been acting as a tour guide for some of the wedding guests. His friends filed a missing persons report in Moscow after his disappearance, his brother said. David Whelan did not immediately respond to requests for additional information. Paul Whelan is 48 and lives in Novi, Michigan, according to public records. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves from May 10, 1994 to Dec. 2, 2008 and the highest rank he attained was staff sergeant, according to records provided by the Pentagon. Whelan was discharged for bad conduct following his conviction by court martial on charges related to larceny, the Pentagon said. BorgWarner Inc (BWA.N), a Michigan-based automotive parts supplier, said Whelan is the company’s director of global security and oversees the safety of its facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and other locations. According to the company’s website, it does not have any locations in Russia. Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it was “possible, even likely” that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered Whelan’s arrest to set up an exchange for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who pleaded guilty on Dec. 13 to acting as an agent to influence conservative groups in the United States. Russia says Butina was forced to make a false confession about being a Russian agent. Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter on Sunday that Moscow was ready for dialogue on a “wide-ranging agenda,” the Kremlin said, following a series of attempts to schedule a second summit between the leaders. At the end of November, Trump cancelled a planned meeting with Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina, citing tensions about Russian forces opening fire on Ukrainian navy boats and then seizing them. Trump’s relations with Putin have been under a microscope because of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied interfering in the election. Trump has said there was no collusion and characterized Mueller’s probe as a witch hunt. Russia’s relations with the United States plummeted when Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Washington and Western allies imposed sanctions on Russian officials, companies and banks.",0
" Brazil’s new President Jair Bolsonaro has used an executive order to give his government secretary potentially far-reaching and restrictive powers over non-governmental organizations working in Brazil. The temporary decree, which will expire unless it is ratified within 120 days by Congress, mandates that the office of the Government Secretary, Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz, “supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the national territory.” The order, signed late on Tuesday, is part of a raft of measures the far-right Bolsonaro administration implemented on its first day in power. Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said the decree on NGOs could be viewed in a positive light, but also expressed concerns. “If the purpose of the measure were to facilitate a constructive relationship between international civil society groups and the government at its highest level, it would be a welcome step,” he said. “However, what strikes me is the use of the terms ‘supervise’ and ‘monitor’, which suggest a fundamental lack of understanding of the independent role that these entities play in any open and democratic society.” The decree did not give reasons for the change, but Bolsonaro said on Twitter that NGOs had “exploited and manipulated” the country’s indigenous population of about 900,000. “Let us together integrate these citizens and value all Brazilians,” he wrote. The president’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolsonaro is a former army captain and his cabinet is full of former high-ranking military officials - including Santos Cruz, a retired general. Brazil’s military has long considered that the rich resources of the vast, sparsely-populated Amazon should be protected from any foreign interest. Environmental and rights groups were already upset by the new government’s decision to give the agriculture ministry power over indigenous land rights decisions, and the latest move risks causing further tension with such groups. A longtime member of Congress, Bolsonaro said at his inauguration on Tuesday that his election had freed the country from “socialism and political correctness.”",0
" President Donald Trump has asked congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday for talks aimed at ending a partial government shutdown over a dispute on border security funding, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday. Speaking after a meeting of congressional leaders with Trump at the White House, McCarthy said he believed the president wanted to find a solution to the crisis. “We know that we have a challenge along the border. We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well,” McCarthy said. Democrats said they would proceed with plans to hold votes on Thursday, when they formally take control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Trump’s fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing money for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump sought. The White House has called the two-part package a “non-starter.” “We’re asking the president to open up government,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive House speaker, told reporters outside the White House after top lawmakers met with Trump and his homeland security officials.",0
" New Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro issued an executive order on Wednesday making the Agriculture Ministry responsible for deciding on lands claimed by indigenous peoples, in a victory for agribusiness that will likely enrage environmentalists. The temporary decree, which will expire unless it is ratified within 120 days by Congress, strips power over land claim decisions from indigenous affairs agency FUNAI. It says the Agriculture Ministry will now be responsible for “identification, delimitation, demarcation and registration of lands traditionally occupied by indigenous people.” The move stoked concern among environmentalists and rights groups that the far-right president, who took office on Tuesday, will open up the vast Amazon rainforest and other ecologically sensitive areas of Brazil to greater commercial exploitation. The executive order also moves the Brazilian Forestry Service, which promotes the sustainable use of forests and is currently linked to the Environment Ministry, under Agriculture Ministry control. Additionally, the decree states that the Agriculture Ministry will be in charge of the management of public forests. Bolsonaro, who enjoys strong support from Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector, said during his campaign he was considering such a move, arguing that protected lands should be opened to commercial activities. Brazil’s 900,000 indigenous people make up less than 1 percent of the population, but live on lands that stretch for 106.7 million hectares (264 million acres), or 12.5 pct of the national territory. “Less than a million people live in these isolated places in Brazil, where they are exploited and manipulated by NGOs,” Bolsonaro tweeted, referring to non-profit groups. “Let us together integrate these citizens and value all Brazilians.” Critics say Bolsonaro’s plan to open indigenous reservations to commercial activity will destroy native cultures and languages by integrating the tribes into Brazilian society. Environmentalists say the native peoples are the last custodians of the Amazon, which is the world’s largest rainforest and is vital for climate stability. Adding to the gloom for NGOs, Bolsonaro also signed an executive order to give his government potentially far-reaching and restrictive powers over non-governmental organizations working in Brazil. The temporary decree mandates that the office of the Government Secretary, Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz, “supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the national territory.” After she was sworn in on Wednesday, new Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias defended the farm sector from accusations it has grown at the expense of the environment, adding that the strength of Brazil’s farmers had generated “unfounded accusations” from unnamed international groups. Dias used to be the head of the farm caucus in Brazil’s Congress, which has long pushed for an end to land measures that it argues hold back the agricultural sector. “Brazil is a country with extremely advanced environmental legislation and is more than able to preserve its native forests,” Dias said. “Our country is a model to be followed, never a transgressor to be punished.” In comments to reporters after her speech, she said that decisions over land rights disputes were a new responsibility for the Agriculture Ministry. However, she indicated that in practise, the demarcation of land limits would fall to a council of ministries, without giving further details. Bartolomeu Braz, the president of the national chapter of Aprosoja, a major grain growers association, cheered Wednesday’s move to transfer indigenous land demarcation to the Agriculture Ministry. “The new rules will be interesting to the farmers and the Indians, some of whom are already producing soybeans. The Indians want to be productive too,” he added. Three-time presidential candidate and former Environment Minister Marina Silva, who was beaten by Bolsonaro in October’s election, reacted with horror to the move. “Bolsonaro has begun his government in the worst possible way,” she wrote on Twitter. Dinamã Tuxá, a member of Brazil’s Association of Indigenous Peoples, said many isolated communities viewed Bolsonaro’s administration with fear. “We are very afraid because Bolsonaro is attacking indigenous policies, rolling back environmental protections, authorizing the invasion of indigenous territories and endorsing violence against indigenous peoples,” said Tuxá. Under the new plan, the indigenous affairs agency FUNAI will be moved into a new ministry for family, women and human rights. A former army captain and longtime member of Congress, Bolsonaro said at his inauguration on Tuesday that he had freed the country from “socialism and political correctness.” An admirer of Donald Trump, Bolsonaro has suggested he will follow the U.S. president’s lead and pull out of the Paris climate change accord. In addition to the indigenous lands decree, the new administration issued decrees affecting the economy and society on Wednesday, while forging closer ties with the United States.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump rebuffed sharp criticism from fellow Republican Mitt Romney on Wednesday, heaping scorn on the incoming senator in a sign of tensions to come in Washington even before a new Congress is officially sworn in. Romney, who starts work on Thursday when members of the 2019-2020 Congress take office, suggested in a newspaper essay published on Tuesday that Trump had “caused dismay around the world” and said his presidency had “made a deep descent in December.” “On balance, his conduct over the past two years ... is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office,” said Romney in the Washington Post essay, reprising a strong critique of Trump that he voiced during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump responded with a tweet on Wednesday, noting Romney’s failed 2012 White House bid and also taking a shot at former Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who has just retired from Congress and who has been one of the few Republican lawmakers to be openly critical of the president. “Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump repeated this theme later during a cabinet meeting, saying he wished Romney could be more of a “team player.” The president, a businessman and television star with no prior government experience, caused deep divisions in the party when he won the Republican White House nomination and then the election in 2016, upending party orthodoxy on foreign policy, deficits and other issues and governing in sometimes turbulent style. But public criticism from Republican lawmakers has been rare. It was unclear whether any other prominent members of the party would feel emboldened to criticise Trump ahead of his presumed 2020 re-election bid, or whether the president will face any serious challengers for the party’s White House nomination. Senator Rand Paul, a conservative Republican, took Romney to task on a conference call. “You’ll find the vast majority (of Republican lawmakers) will wish he hadn’t said it,” said Paul. Brushing aside the fact that Trump often personally attacks and insults other politicians, Paul said Romney’s criticism of the president’s character was a “big mistake” and an attempt by the new senator to present himself as “holier than thou.” “Some might say it’s sour grapes at not having won the (presidential) post himself,” said Paul. He added: “I don’t think there’s an appetite for a Romney run (for president) in the Republican Party.” Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel also criticized Romney, saying on Twitter his essay was an attack on Trump that was “disappointing and unproductive.” McDaniel is a niece of Romney. Seven years ago, Romney was the party’s presidential nominee, running with Paul Ryan, who retired from Congress last month. Romney lost to then incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama. Paul also took a run at the presidency. He dropped out early in 2016 from the Republican primary race that Trump won. Representatives for Romney could not be immediately reached for comment on the tweets and remarks by Trump, Paul and McDaniel. Romney and Trump traded barbs during the 2016 campaign, with Romney calling Trump a “fraud” and Trump slamming Romney’s 2012 loss. The two later appeared to bury the hatchet, with Trump briefly considering Romney to be his secretary of state and endorsing Romney’s 2018 run for the Senate. But in Tuesday’s essay, Romney wrote of Trump, “The appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs all defined his presidency down.” He promised to speak his mind in Washington, which will now feature a divided Congress as Republicans retain a majority in the Senate and Democrats take control of the House of Representatives, after Republicans lost their House majority in November’s elections. “I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” Romney wrote.

" Results from Democratic Republic of Congo’s chaotic presidential election could be delayed past Sunday’s deadline because counting centres are still waiting for more than 80 percent of local tallies, the electoral commission said. The election, which is meant to mark Congo’s first democratic transfer of power, has already been marred by violence and logistical problems. The opposition has said there was widespread fraud, an accusation dismissed by the government. As of Wednesday - three days after the election - counting centres had received just 17 percent of the tally sheets drawn up by individual polling stations, the president of the CENI electoral commission, Corneille Nangaa, told Reuters. “We will try as hard as possible to meet Sunday’s deadline, but it will be challenging,” Nangaa said. He did not say what was causing the delays. A spokesman for Felix Tshisekedi, one of two opposition candidates, said the hold-up was a further sign of fraud. “They are clearly trying to prolong the process to manipulate the truth of the ballots,” said Vidiye Tshimanga. There was no immediate reaction from the government, though regional monitors earlier said the Dec. 30 vote was “relatively well-managed” given the challenges involved. The election allowed “the majority of the Congolese population to exercise its right to vote,” the Southern African Development Community (SADC) said. Vote counting was transparent, 59 percent of polling places it observed opened on time and police securing the polls behaved professionally, the organisation added. Approval of the election’s results by SADC powers such as South Africa and Angola will be critical for the legitimacy of the administration of the next president, who will succeed veteran incumbent Joseph Kabila on Jan. 18. Angola and South Africa have been important allies of Kabila over the years, but relations were strained by his refusal to step down when his mandate officially expired in 2016. Pre-election polling showed Kabila’s preferred candidate, ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, but both sides say they expect to win. An African Union observer mission said in a separate statement on Wednesday that election day was blighted by a number of logistical problems. “The holding of these elections constitutes, in itself, a first great victory for the Congolese people,” it said. “The mission strongly wishes that the results that will be declared are true to the vote of the Congolese people.” Kabila’s government refused to accredit election monitors from the European Union and the U.S.-based Carter Centre, which said there were widespread irregularities in the 2011 election. Contested election results in 2006 and 2011 led to violent street protests, and a disputed outcome this time could also destabilise Congo’s volatile eastern borderlands with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, where dozens of militia groups are active.

" President Donald Trump’s declaration in a phone call with Tayyip Erdogan that he was pulling U.S. troops from Syria has stunned Turkey and left it scrambling to respond to the changing battlefield on its southern border. In the phone call two weeks ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, U.S. officials say. Instead, in the course of the conversation Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Ankara the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria. “Trump asked: ‘If we withdraw our soldiers, can you clean up ISIS?’”, a Turkish official told Reuters. He said Erdogan replied that Turkish forces were up to the task. “Then you do it,” Trump told him abruptly. To his national security adviser John Bolton, also on the call, Trump said: “Start work for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.” “I have to say it was an unexpected decision. The word ‘surprise’ is too weak to describe the situation,” said the official, one of five Turkish sources who spoke to Reuters about the Dec. 14 call between the two leaders. Trump’s decision was also a shock in Washington, where senior administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, tried for days to change the president’s mind, U.S. officials said. When Trump made clear he would not back down, Mattis and a senior official coordinating the fight against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, both resigned. On a visit to a U.S. air base in Iraq this week, Trump said that military commanders had repeatedly requested extensions for the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria - requests that he finally turned down because he said Islamic State was largely beaten. “We’ve knocked them silly. I will tell you I’ve had some very good talks with President Erdogan who wants to knock them out also, and he’ll do it,” he told American troops. For Turkey, Trump’s decision offers opportunity and risk. Ankara has complained bitterly for years that the United States, a NATO ally, had chosen the Kurdish YPG militia as its main partner on the ground in Syria against Islamic State. Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist group, inseparable from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey in which 40,000 people have been killed. The U.S. withdrawal potentially frees Turkey’s military to push the YPG back from 500 km of border without risking a confrontation with American forces. It also removes a main cause of this year’s diplomatic crisis between the two countries. But it also opens up an area of Syria far larger than anything Turkey had expected to fill, potentially pitting it against not just Kurdish forces but also the Damascus government - which is committed to regaining control of all of Syria - and its Russian and Iranian backers. The YPG on Friday asked the Syrian government to take over the town of Manbij, which the Kurdish militia currently controls with U.S. support, to protect it from Turkish attack. And if Turkish forces are to take on Islamic State in its last pocket of Syrian territory near the Iraqi border, they would first have to cross 250 km of territory controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces. “Erdogan got more than he bargained for,” said Soner Cagaptay, Director of the Turkish Program at the Washington Institute. “He had asked the U.S. to drop the YPG, but not withdraw from Syria”. Erdogan has for years backed rebels who once hoped to topple Bashar al-Assad, but the Syrian president’s survival has been assured by support from Tehran and Moscow even though the north and east - including Syrian oilfields - remain beyond Assad’s control for now. As it takes stock of the new challenge, Turkey is launching intensive talks with Washington and Moscow. Ankara expects U.S. military officials to visit within days, as well as Bolton and possibly the U.S. special Syria envoy, James Jeffrey. Turkey’s intelligence chief and defence and foreign ministers are also due in Moscow on Saturday, the spokesman for Erdogan’s AK Party said. “Of course it will be difficult. The whole issue needs to be planned again from the start,” a Turkish security official said. A U.S. official said military planners were drafting plans that could see a withdrawal over the course of several months. One of the proposals under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according a person familiar with discussions. Washington is also grappling with what to do with weapons it provided to the YPG militia and promised to take back after the campaign against Islamic State ended. Turkey says the weapons must be collected so they are not used against Turkish troops, but U.S. officials say they cannot disarm their own allies when the fight is not yet over. Erdogan announced last week Turkey is postponing its planned military operation against the YPG in light of Trump’s decision. The Turkish military has already carried out two incursions into north Syria, backed by pro-Turkey Syrian rebels. In 2016 they targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters, and earlier this year took control of the YPG-held Afrin region. But Ankara and its Syrian rebel allies alone do not have the capacity to take over the whole region which the United States is abandoning, Cagaptay said. Turkey’s priority therefore may be to secure its southern frontier. “Distancing the YPG from the border and wiping out these elements is of critical importance,” the security official said. He stressed the need for careful coordination over who should fill other areas which departing U.S. forces will leave, and warned of problems ahead if agreement could not be reached. “Is it a big victory for Turkey?” another official said. “I’m not sure right now.” Additional reporting by Tulay Karadeniz in Ankara and Humeyra Pamuk and Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by Dominic Evans and Angus MacSwan All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" The Syrian army said it had deployed forces to Manbij in northern Syria on Friday after the Kurdish YPG militia urged Damascus to protect the town, where U.S. forces operate, from the threat of a major Turkish offensive. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said the government forces had entered a strip of territory at the edge of Manbij, not inside the town itself, creating a barrier with Turkey-backed fighters nearby. Manbij, which U.S.-backed forces captured from Islamic State in 2016, has emerged as a focal point of new tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces whose presence has effectively deterred Turkey. After the Syrian army announcement, Turkey-backed Syrian rebels stationed in nearby territory said they had begun moving together with Turkish forces towards the town in readiness for “the start of military operations to liberate” it. A witness said convoys of Turkey-backed insurgents, with armoured vehicles and machine guns, were moving towards the frontline with the town. Manbij, where U.S. troops have a military base, is held by a local militia allied to the YPG which Turkey deems a security threat. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that U.S. troops had not changed their positions in Manbij and dozens still remained. The official said they had not seen Syrian military forces inside Manbij but rather on the outskirts of the city. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has vowed to crush the YPG, said Turkish officials would visit Russia - Assad’s most powerful ally - on Saturday and discuss Syria. He indicated Turkey was not in a hurry to launch an offensive. Trump’s abrupt decision to withdraw troops from Syria has alarmed the Kurdish-led fighters who have fought Islamic State alongside them for years. Kurdish leaders are scrambling for a strategy to protect their region stretching across the north and east, where the presence of some 2,000 U.S. troops has so far deterred Turkey. A deployment of Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, would complicate any offensive by Turkey and its Syrian rebel proxies. U.S. military support for the Kurdish fighters has infuriated Turkey, which sees the YPG as an extension of the PKK movement that has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey for decades. Syrian state media circulated a video showing dozens of soldiers marching on a countryside road, chanting for President Bashar al-Assad. The military statement said troops had raised the national flag in Manbij on Friday and would guarantee security “for all Syrian citizens and others present.” A resident inside the town said nothing had changed and he had not seen any such flags. The YPG said on Friday its fighters had withdrawn from Manbij before to fight Islamic State elsewhere. “We invite the Syrian government, to which we belong, as people, land and borders, to send its armed forces to take over these positions and protect Manbij in the face of Turkish threats,” it said. In November, Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols near Manbij after reaching a deal that includes the YPG exiting the town.",0
" Britain’s Royal Mail apologised on Friday after historians pointed out that a stamp design it planned to issue to commemorate the D-Day landings in France in fact showed U.S. troops going ashore thousands of miles away weeks earlier. The stamp, part of a series of 11 to mark the 75th anniversary of the June 1944 landings, was part of a special programme for 2019 to showcase the “Best of British”. “The stamp issue will be a timely commemoration of all those who participated and will use images from the day itself,” the Royal Mail said before the blunder was revealed. However, after a preview of the stamp was put on the Royal Mail’s Twitter feed, historians and others noticed that it actually showed U.S. troops wading ashore in May 1944 in Dutch New Guinea, now Indonesia, from a landing craft that was not involved in the D-Day landings. “We sincerely apologise that our 2019 Special Stamp preview included a design which had been incorrectly associated with the D-Day landings,” Royal Mail said on Twitter. “This stamp design has not been printed. We would like to reassure our customers that this image will not be part of the final set.” (This story has been corrected in the first paragraph to show U.S. troops landed weeks, not months earlier)",0
" The United States is deeply concerned about an increase in coca cultivation in Colombia, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, but will work with the Andean country to cut production of the raw material for cocaine in half by the end of 2023. Pompeo met with Colombian President Ivan Duque on a brief visit to the coastal city of Cartagena. “The United States remains deeply concerned about the surge in coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia since 2013,” Pompeo told journalists following the meeting. Colombia has long been ranked as the world’s top producer of cocaine, for which coca is the base ingredient, but figures compiled by the United Nations for 2017 showed the largest potential output since the organisation began keeping records, with cocaine production at 1,379 metric tons. “We will continue to work with you Mr. President side-by-side to achieve our joint objectives to cut coca cultivation and coca production by 50 percent between now and 2023,” Pompeo said. Colombia’s acreage of coca, the raw material for cocaine, expanded 17 percent to 171,000 hectares (422,550 acres) in 2017, according to the U.N. The uptick was due to increased productivity and growers eager to expand in hopes of getting more aid to switch to legal crops. The government wants to eradicate 100,000 hectares of coca crops in 2019. Duque said last month that 2018 eradication would total more than 80,000 hectares of illicit crops. The U.S. commitment to helping Colombia dismantle organised crime groups is “vital”, Duque said in his remarks. Aerial fumigation with the herbicide glyphosate, suspended in 2015 after being linked to cancer, may be reinstated if it can be made to comply with judicial conditions, Duque has said. Duque and Pompeo also discussed the crisis in Venezuela, where hyperinflation and food and medicine shortages have spurred more than 3 million people to flee over the past several years, including more than a million who now live in Colombia. Pompeo commended Colombia for its support of Venezuelan migrants and said he and Duque discussed how to collaborate on aid with regional and international bodies. “All countries that defend democracy, all countries that share the value of democracy should unite to reject the Venezuelan dictatorship,” Duque said. The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuela’s debt and on some officials in socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s government, which it accuses of corruption and human rights violations. Maduro blames Venezuela’s economic problems on U.S. sanctions and an “economic war” led by political adversaries.",0
" Brazil’s new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday said that the country’s armed forces were an obstacle for any person or group who might wish to usurp power.

Araujo’s thoughts on international relations mark an abrupt break from Brazil’s traditional conciliatory stances. Araujo said it was time for Brazilians to focus on patriotism and be less concerned with the global order.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States would get out of Syria slowly “over a period of time” and would protect the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in the country as Washington draws down troops. Trump did not provide a timetable for the planned military exit from Syria, which he announced last month against the advice of top national security aides and without consulting lawmakers or U.S. allies participating in anti-Islamic State operations. The decision prompted Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to resign. Trump said on Wednesday he had essentially fired Mattis, whose letter of resignation was seen as a sharp rebuke to the Republican president. During a Cabinet meeting at the White House in front of reporters, Trump said he had never set a reported four-month timetable for the withdrawal of 2,000 American troops stationed in Syria amid a battle against Islamic State militants. “We’re getting out and we’re getting out smart,” Trump said. “I never said I’m getting out tomorrow.” He declined to be specific about how long troops would remain in Syria. In recent days, Trump appeared to back off from any hasty pullout and stressed that the operation would be slow. “We’re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting Isis [Islamic State] remnants,” he said on Twitter on Monday. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he came out of a recent lunch with Trump feeling reassured about the Syria policy. Graham told reporters that Trump was committed to making sure Turkey did not clash with the Kurdish YPG forces once U.S. troops leave Syria, and was assuring the NATO ally that it would have a buffer zone in the region to help protect its own interests. Turkey views the YPG as a branch of its own Kurdish separatist movement and is threatening to launch an offensive against the group, igniting fears of significant civilian casualties. U.S. commanders planning the U.S. withdrawal are recommending that YPG fighters battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, according to U.S. officials. That proposal would likely anger Turkey, where Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, is expected to hold talks in the coming days. Trump said he was not happy that the Kurds were selling oil to Iran, but that he wanted to protect them either way. “I didn’t like the fact that they’re selling the small (amount of) oil that they have to Iran, and we asked them not to sell it to Iran... We’re not thrilled about that. OK? I’m not happy about it at all,” he said. “We want to protect the Kurds, nevertheless. We want to protect the Kurds, but I don’t want to be in Syria forever. It’s sand. And it’s death.” Trump has been critical of previous administrations for sending and keeping U.S. troops abroad, and has made bringing troops home part of his signature “America First” policy as he eyes a re-election bid in 2020.",0
" A shutdown of about a quarter of the U.S. government rolled into its 12th day on Wednesday, with lawmakers and President Donald Trump divided over his demand for money for a border wall. The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, is the 19th to occur since the mid-1970s. Most have been brief. Trump’s latest is the third on the Republican president’s watch and already ranks among the longest ever. A meeting on the shutdown at the White House with senior lawmakers was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. There were several very short shutdowns under Republican President Ronald Reagan. Under Democratic President Bill Clinton, there were two shutdowns, including the longest on record: 21 days in 1996. A 16-day shutdown happened under Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013 in a fight with Republicans over his healthcare law. The current shutdown has not affected three-quarters of the government, including the Department of Defence and the Postal Service, which have secure funding. But 800,000 employees from the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation and other agencies have been furloughed or are working without pay. Here is what is happening around the federal government. The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo in Washington are closed due to the shutdown, according to the Smithsonian website. Among these is the popular National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016. “The museum is closed due to the federal government shutdown. Timed entry pass holders will be emailed instructions on how to reschedule their visit,” the museum posted on Instagram. The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected. But most employees are “essential,” so they are working without pay until a funding bill is passed. Of 245,000 agency employees, nearly 213,000 have been deemed “essential,” according to the department’s contingency plan. Most of this department’s 7,500 employees are “non-essential;” only about 340 are working. Nearly 1,000 others may be called in for specific tasks, without pay. Public housing authorities and Native American tribal housing entities are not part of the federal government and so are not required to shut down. But the federal government provides some of their funding, so they may need to reduce or change operating hours. HUD, which oversees some housing loan and low-income housing payment programs, warned in its contingency plan that “a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend towards a strengthening market that we’ve been experiencing.” The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau are not publishing economic data, including key figures on gross domestic product, inflation, personal income, spending, trade and new home sales, during the shutdown. The agency that oversees the federal workforce has given advice to workers on dealing with landlords, mortgage lenders and other creditors, including sample letters explaining severe lost income due to the lack of federal funding. The FCC, which regulates radio and television broadcast and cable systems, said it will suspend most operations at midday on Thursday, if the shutdown has not ended by then. Work for “the protection of life and property” will continue. So will operations at the agency’s Office of Inspector General, the FCC’s internal watchdog. Members of the Coast Guard were due to get their final 2018 paychecks on Monday, their last until the government reopens. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was to resume issuing new flood insurance policies during the shutdown, reversing an earlier decision. The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, is operating with a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, some parks may be accessible, with others closed completely. The National Park Service is providing no visitor services such as restrooms, facility and road maintenance and trash collection. Of its 55,000 employees, 20,400 have been put on leave. This excludes most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 are working and the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources. Air traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations continue, but some rulemaking, inspections and audits have been paused. An estimated 1,100 of the office’s 1,800 employees are on leave. This includes most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps implement budget and policy goals.",0
" Twenty-eight bodies have been recovered from the debris of an apartment block in Russia that partially collapsed in an apparent explosion, while 13 people remained unaccounted for, the regional emergencies ministry said on Wednesday. The blast, initially thought to have been caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk in the early hours on Monday, 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. A baby boy was found alive on Tuesday after 35 hours spent in freezing cold in the rubble, in what emergency officials described as a miracle. The emergencies ministry said more than 900 people were carrying out the search and rescue operation at the site. It said six people have been rescued. The reason behind the collapse of the apartment block is still being investigated, the Investigative Committee, which probes into major cries, said on its website. It said no trace of explosives materials had been found so far on the site. The initial reports put a possible gas leak behind the collapse. There have been several similar incidents in the country in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations about gas usage. In a separate incident in the same street late on Tuesday, three people died when a minibus became engulfed in flames, TASS news agency reported citing the local government office. Video footage purporting to show the incident, posted on social media sites, shows a burning vehicle and some bangs are heard. A police spokesman declined to comment when contacted by phone.",0

" A decline in the number of mortgages approved by British high-street banks flattened out last month, with the first year-on-year rise since September 2017, figures from industry group UK Finance showed on Friday. Britain’s housing market has slowed since the country voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, and other surveys this month have shown anxiety among consumers and businesses ahead of the planned departure on March 29. Friday’s data showed British banks approved 39,403 mortgages for house purchase in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, down from 39,640 in October but up by 0.2 percent from November 2017 — the first annual rise in 14 months. “The housing market is struggling for momentum in the face of still relatively limited consumer purchasing power, fragile consumer confidence and, possibly, wariness over higher interest rates,” Howard Archer, chief economist at consultants EY ITEM Club, said. Many economists expect house prices to be flat or marginally higher next year, as weakness in London and surrounding areas weighs on faster price growth in other parts of Britain, though the Bank of England has said falls of as much as a third are possible if Brexit descends into chaos. Prime Minister Theresa May’s minority government plans to seek parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal in the week starting Jan. 14, after scrapping a vote before Christmas due to opposition from lawmakers of all parties. Without a deal, Britain faces major economic disruption from the reintroduction of tariffs and customs checks at its borders. UK Finance said credit card lending picked up slightly last month, though this mostly reflected a shift in preferred payment means rather than higher borrowing, with credit cards offering better consumer protection for purchases such as holiday travel. Net lending to non-financial businesses fell by the most since May, dropping by 656 million pounds ($829 million). “Overall lending to businesses has remained subdued in this period of economic uncertainty,” UK Finance’s managing director for commercial finance, Stephen Pegge, said.

" As moves towards peace pick up in Afghanistan, the Taliban are trying to show they have changed since the brutal days of the 1990s when they banned music and girls’ education and carried out public executions in Kabul’s football stadium. “If peace comes and the Taliban return, then our return will not be in the same harsh way as it was in 1996,” Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told Reuters, referring to the year they took over in Kabul before their ouster by U.S.-led troops in 2001. “We want to assure Afghan nationals that there will be no threat to anyone from our side.” The comments come as moves towards peace negotiations have intensified, following a series of meetings between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives over the past three months. Expectations of a decisive shift have been heightened by reports that more than 5,000 U.S. troops may be withdrawn from Afghanistan, in an abrupt about-turn from the previous U.S. strategy of stepping up military pressure on the insurgents. “Our opposition is with the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan. Once they are out and a peace deal is reached, then a nationwide amnesty will be announced,” said Mujahid. “No one, police, army, government employees or anyone, will face revenge behaviour from our side.” Reports of the withdrawal are unconfirmed but they have triggered alarm among many Afghans with bitter memories of the Taliban’s ultra-hardline regime. “I don’t think their mindset has changed but they have realised that without respecting human rights, they cannot be accepted by the international community,” said Bilal Sediqi, spokesman for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. With Afghanistan likely to remain dependent on foreign aid for years, the Taliban know they cannot return to the past when fighters swept into Kabul after the chaos of the 1990s civil war. But they insist that as well as the withdrawal of foreign forces, there will be a return to their strict version of Islamic rule and many Afghans doubt their claims to have softened, even while yearning for an end to the war. In June, Taliban leaders were angry at their fighters swapping selfies with soldiers and government officials and eating ice cream with civilians during a three-day ceasefire. Soon afterwards, they launched complex attacks on strategic provinces to try to oust Afghan forces and used civilians as human shields. “I know there is no place for me if the Taliban return in their old style,” said Abdul, a 12-year police veteran currently working in the western province of Farah. “...I will stand by the government side whatever it decides. But still I have not lost my hope in the future. The Taliban are not the old ones. We see changes among them. They are also tired of war.” The Taliban, a predominantly ethnic Pashtun movement, strongest in the south and east of the country, now control large stretches of the countryside, where they levy taxes, run courts and control education. For many conservative rural Afghans, Taliban rule provides welcome stability and the merciless punishments and rigid controls on women’s rights fit well with traditional practices in many areas. In the Aqtash district of northern Kunduz province, a hotbed of Taliban insurgents, some women said they are allowed to walk freely and do not have to cover their faces in all-enveloping burqas. Mujahid said the Taliban were not against women’s education or employment but wanted to maintain cultural and religious codes. “We are not against women working in government organisations or against their outdoor activities, but we will be against the alien culture clothes worn by women, brought to our country,” Mujahid said. Omaid Maisam, the deputy spokesman for Afghan Chief Executive officer Abdullah Abdullah, said the government protects human rights and the Taliban must accept the national constitution to shed their hardline image. “We have seen some signs of changes among them, but they have to show it in their actions that they have really changed,” he said. Many believe the return on the Taliban would threaten the gains the country has made since 2001. Much work remains to be done to convince women in work or education and sceptical groups of ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras from northern and central Afghanistan. “I think that these statements that the Taliban have changed are only excuses that are being used by the Taliban to gain acceptance,” said Malina Hamidi, a teacher at a school in the Chamtal district of Balkh province. “I am 100 percent confident that once they come back to power, they will be the same Taliban that ruled Afghanistan in the nineties.” Additional reporting by Abdul Matin Sahak in MAZAR-I SHARIF; Writing by Rupam Jain in Kabul; Editing by Nick Macfie All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" Brazil’s newly inaugurated President Jair Bolsonaro said on Tuesday his election had freed the country from “socialism and political correctness,” and he vowed to tackle corruption, crime and economic mismanagement in Latin America’s largest nation. Bolsonaro, a former army captain turned lawmaker who openly admires Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, promised in his first remarks as president to adhere to democratic norms, after his tirades against the media and political opponents had stirred unease. While investors hope Bolsonaro’s free-market stance will reinvigorate Brazil’s economy - the eight largest in the world - environmentalists and rights groups are worried he will roll back protections for the Amazon rain forest and loosen gun controls in a country that already has the world’s highest number of murders. “This is the beginning of Brazil’s liberation from socialism, political correctness and a bloated state,” Bolsonaro, 63, said in an address to the nation made after he donned the presidential sash. A seven-term congressman who spent decades on the fringes of Brazilian politics, Bolsonaro was swept to power in October by voters’ outrage with traditional political parties, making him Brazil’s first right-wing president since the dictatorship. Voters punished mainstream parties following more than four years of graft investigations that laid bare the largest political corruption scheme ever discovered. Centrist parties were trounced, reshaping Brazil’s political landscape and polarizing Congress. Following a knife attack during the presidential campaign that left Bolsonaro hospitalized for weeks, security was tight for his inauguration. Some 10,000 police officers and soldiers were deployed on the streets of Brasilia, the capital, as Bolsonaro and his wife rode in an open-topped Rolls-Royce to Congress. His voters are now impatient for Bolsonaro to make good on ambitious promises to tackle graft and violent crime and revive an economy still sputtering after the collapse of a commodities boom led to Brazil’s worst recession on record. As thousands of supporters, many with the Brazilian flag draped around their shoulders, chanted “the captain has arrived!,” Bolsonaro launched into a fiery speech. “We have the great challenge of taking on the effects of an economic crisis, of facing the distortion of human rights and the breakdown of the family,” he said. “We must urgently end ideologies that defend criminals and penalise police.” Bolsonaro, who was sworn in before a joint session of Congress, called on lawmakers to help him “free the nation definitively from the yoke of corruption, crime, economic irresponsibility and ideological submission.” On the economic front, the new leader promised to open foreign markets for Brazil and enact reforms to reduce a yawning budget deficit, putting government accounts on a sustainable path. Bolsonaro plans to realign Brazil internationally, moving away from developing-nation allies and closer to the policies of Western leaders, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump, who sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to his inauguration. Trump congratulated Bolsonaro in a Twitter message, writing “The USA is with you”. As a clear sign of that diplomatic shift, Bolsonaro plans to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking with Brazil’s traditional support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue. Backed massively by conservative sectors of Brazil, including Christian evangelical churches, Bolsonaro would block moves to legalize abortion beyond even the current limited exceptions and remove sex education from public schools, opposing what he calls “cultural Marxism” introduced by recent leftist governments. One-third of his Cabinet are former army officers, mostly fellow cadets at the Black Needles academy, Brazil’s West Point, all outspoken backers of the former military regime. Bolsonaro has faced charges of inciting rape and for hate crimes because of comments about women, gays and racial minorities. Yet his law-and-order rhetoric and plans to ease gun controls have resonated with many voters, especially in Brazil’s booming farm country. In an interview with Record TV on the eve of his inauguration, Bolsonaro lashed out at Brazil’s notorious bureaucracy, which makes doing business difficult and expensive. He vowed to strip away the so-called “Brazil Cost” that hamstrings private enterprise. “The government machine is really heavy,” he said. “There are hundreds of bureaucratic governing bodies across Brazil, of regulators as well. ... We have to untangle the mess.” Bolsonaro’s vow to follow Trump’s example and pull Brazil out of the Paris climate change agreement has worried environmentalists. So have his plans to build hydroelectric dams in the Amazon and open up to mining the reservations of indigenous peoples who are seen as the last custodians of the world’s biggest forest. Brazilian businesses are eager to see Bolsonaro take office and install a team of orthodox economists led by investment banker Paulo Guedes, who has promised quick action in bringing Brazil’s unsustainable budget deficit under control. Guedes plans to sell as many state companies as possible in a privatisation drive that he forecasts could eventually bring in up to 1 trillion reais (202.3 billion pounds) That would help restore order to government finances. The key measure, however, for reducing the deficit and stopping a dangerous rise of Brazil’s public debt will be the overhaul of the costly social security system. Pension reform will be Bolsonaro’s biggest challenge since he has yet to build a base in Congress, where he has eschewed the political horse-trading that traditionally helped Brazilian presidents govern the nation of nearly 210 million people.",0
" Algeria has barred all Syrians from entering the country via its southern border with Mali and Niger to keep out members of defeated rebel groups from Syria deemed to pose a security risk, a senior official said on Wednesday. Hassen Kacimi, the official in charge of migrants policy at the interior ministry, told Reuters that Syrians seeking refuge in Algeria in this way were suspected to be Islamist militants and were not welcome. Algeria went through years of devastating civil war with hardcore jihadist groups in the 1990s. While violence is now greatly diminished, sporadic attacks continue in isolated areas. “We have hosted 50,000 Syrians in the past few years for humanitarian reasons,” Kacimi said, alluding to refugees from Syria’s civil war, “but we cannot accept members of armed groups fleeing from Syria when it comes to our security.” He said around 100 had reached the southern border with the help of local armed escorts in recent weeks but were intercepted and expelled shortly after they slipped into Algeria. Kacimi said these Syrians had transited Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan and Niger or Mali using fake Sudanese passports. “Definitely this is a criminal network and we must be very vigilant not to allow them get into Algeria,” he said. Algeria has kept diplomatic relations with Syria throughout its own civil war, in which President Bashar al-Assad has largely defeated rebels and jihadists trying to topple him. Syrians do not need visas to enter Algeria. Algeria’s south and southeast are largely empty desert regions but it has beefed up its security presence there after neighbouring Libya and northern Mali and Niger fell into the hands of various militant and rebel factions. Since its 1990s civil war, Algeria has become an important U.S. ally against Islamist militants active in the arid Sahel region of north and west Africa.",0
" Somalia has kicked out the country’s top United Nations official in a decision likely to harm relations with foreign powers backing government attempts to restore stability after decades of turmoil. The government accused Nicholas Haysom, Special Representative of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, of interfering with internal affairs. The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that has lacked strong central government since 1991. The government’s decision over Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semi-autonomous regions. Haysom raised questions in a Dec. 30 letter about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security forces in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who was blocked from running in a recent regional election. Haysom “is not required and cannot work in this country”, the foreign affairs ministry said. “He openly breached the appropriate conduct of the U.N. office in Somalia,” said the statement late on Tuesday, which effectively makes the South African persona non grata. The United Nations is looking into the matter, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York on Wednesday. “We’re trying to get the various details corroborated and we’re going to see, based on that, what further steps are needed,” Haq said. He said Haysom was due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Thursday - as previously scheduled - on the U.N. mission in Somalia, which also supports an African Union peacekeeping force fighting al Shabaab. Haysom was also due to meet with Guterres. Haysom’s letter to Somalia’s interior security minister expressed concern over the government’s handling of the arrest of former Shabaab leader Mukhtar Robow and subsequent unrest last month. At least 15 civilians were killed and around 300 people detained, most of them children, when protests erupted after Robow’s arrest in the southern city of Baidoa, according to the U.N. letter. The government said Robow was arrested on suspicion that he had brought militants and weapons back to Baidoa, the capital of South West region where he tried to contest for president in last month’s election. His arrest sparked clashes between militiamen loyal to Robow and Somali forces. Ethiopian security forces, who are part of an African Union peacekeeping force, were also involved. Al Shabaab has sought for over a decade to topple the central government and implement its strict version of Islamic law. It was driven out of the capital in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions including South West. Robow renounced violence and recognised federal authority in 2017. In the letter, Haysom asked the minister to explain the legal basis for Robow’s arrest. He also asked what action had been taken to investigate the deaths during the demonstrations in Baidoa following the arrest. The U.N. letter also contained an annexed letter from the European Union, Germany and Britain announcing the suspension of their support to the police in South West state due to their conduct during last month’s election. Haysom also detailed the U.N. support to the Somali police force and the South West regional police which includes the payment of stipends to the police.

" Sudanese authorities are blocking access to popular social media platforms used to organise and broadcast nationwide anti-government protests triggered by an economic crisis, internet users say. Sudan has been rocked by near-daily demonstrations over the past two weeks. Protesters have set alight ruling party buildings and have called on President Omar al-Bashir, who took power in 1989, to step down. In a country where the state tightly controls traditional media, the internet has become a key information battleground. Of Sudan’s 40 million people, some 13 million use the internet and more than 28 million own mobile phones, local media say. Authorities have not repeated the internet blackout they imposed during deadly protests in 2013. But the head of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service, Salah Abdallah, told a rare news conference on Dec. 21: “There was a discussion in the government about blocking social media sites and in the end it was decided to block them.” Users of the three main telecommunications operators in the country — Zain, MTN and Sudani — said access to Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp has only been possible through use of a virtual private network (VPN). Though VPNs can bring their own connection problems and some Sudanese are unaware of their existence, activists have used them widely to organise and document the demonstrations. Hashtags in Arabic such as “Sudan’s_cities_revolt” have been widely circulated from Sudan and abroad. Hashtags in English such as #SudanRevolts have also been used. “Social media has a really big impact, and it helps with forming public opinion and transmitting what’s happening in Sudan to the outside,” said Mujtaba Musa, a Sudanese Twitter user with over 50,000 followers who has been active in documenting the protests. NetBlocks, a digital rights NGO, said data it collected, including from thousands of Sudanese volunteers, provided evidence of “an extensive internet censorship regime”. Bader al-Kharafi, CEO of parent company Zain Group, told Reuters: “Some websites may be blocked for technical reasons beyond the company’s specialisation.” Neither the National Telecommunications Corporation, which oversees the sector in Sudan, nor MTN or Sudani could be reached for comment. Twitter and Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp, declined to comment. “While Sudan has a long history of systematically censoring print and broadcast media, online media has been relatively untouched despite its exponential growth... in recent years,” said Mai Truong of U.S.-based advocacy group Freedom House. “The authorities have only now started to follow the playbook of other authoritarian governments.” Additional reporting by Ahmed Hagagy in Kuwait; Editing by Aidan Lewis and Gareth Jones All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" Scientists have found that a strain of cholera causing an epidemic in Yemen – the worst in recorded history – came from eastern Africa and was probably borne into Yemen by migrants. Using genomic sequencing techniques, researchers at Britain’s Wellcome Sanger Institute and France’s Institut Pasteur also said they should now be better able to estimate the risk of future cholera outbreaks in regions like Yemen, giving health authorities more time to intervene. “Knowing how cholera moves globally gives us the opportunity to better prepare for future outbreaks,” said Nick Thomson, a professor at Sanger and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who co-led the work. Nearly four years of war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthi group have crippled healthcare and sanitation systems in Yemen, where some 1.2 million suspected cholera cases have been reported since 2017, with 2,515 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in October that the outbreak is accelerating again with roughly 10,000 suspected cases now reported per week, double the average rate for the first eight months of 2018. To explore the origins of the outbreak, Sanger and Pasteur team sequenced the genomes of cholera bacteria samples collected in Yemen and nearby areas. They included samples from a Yemeni refugee center on the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border and 74 other cholera samples from South Asia, the Middle East and eastern and central Africa. The team, whose findings were published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, then compared these sequences to a global collection of more than 1,000 cholera samples and found that the strain causing the Yemen epidemic is related to one first seen in 2012 in South Asia that has spread globally. However, the Yemeni strain did not arrive directly from South Asia, the scientists found, but was circulating and causing outbreaks in eastern Africa in 2013-14, prior to appearing in Yemen in 2016. “Genomics enabled us to discover that the strain of cholera behind the devastating and ongoing epidemic in Yemen is likely linked to the migration of people from eastern Africa into Yemen,” said Thomson. He added, however, that from the samples available, the team was not able to pinpoint exactly which countries in eastern Africa the strain had come from.",0
" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed supporting a return to democracy in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua with Brazil’s new right-wing government on Wednesday, in a joint effort against what he called authoritarian regimes in Latin America. Pompeo and Brazil’s Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo considered deepening cooperation in the region at a meeting in Brasilia following Tuesday’s inauguration of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. They discussed “supporting the people of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in restoring democratic governance and their human rights,” State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said. Pompeo later met with Bolsonaro and also broached the question of “reinforcing democratic governance and human rights” in those three countries. Speaking to reporters in Brasilia, Pompeo said Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua were countries that do not share the democratic values that unite the United States and Brazil. “We have an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes,” he said at a news conference. In response, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement it “categorically rejected” Pompeo’s “interventionist attitude,” accusing him of seeking to rally support among Latin American countries for “forcible regime change” in Venezuela. Cuban Communist Party leader Raul Castro on Tuesday blasted the Trump administration for returning to an outdated path of confrontation with his island nation and of intervening in Latin America, in a speech marking the 60th anniversary of Cuba’s revolution. Pompeo gave no details of how Washington plans to step up pressure for democratic change in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. He did not address a reporter’s question on whether military intervention would be an option. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine in the OPEC nation, with most of them having left since 2015, according to the United Nations. Nearby South American countries like Brazil and Colombia have received the bulk of the migrants. The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuela’s debt and on some officials in socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s government, which it accuses of corruption and human rights violations. Maduro frequently blames a U.S.-led “economic war” for the country’s woes.",0
" The death toll from landslides and devastating floods in the central Philippines triggered by a tropical depression climbed to 85, officials said on Wednesday, and 20 people were missing as rescuers slowly reached cut-off communities. The casualties, including young children, were mostly killed when their homes collapsed in landslides after days of heavy rain in several provinces in the central Philippines, said Ricardo Jalad, executive director of the national disaster agency. “If we don’t recover the missing or we recover them dead, that is 105 deaths, which we hope not,” Jalad said. The tropical depression, which weakened into a low pressure system before leaving the Philippines on Sunday, brought heavy rain that triggered landslides and flooding in the Bicol and eastern Visayas regions. Officials put three provinces under a “state of calamity” to give them access to emergency funds. Bicol, with a population of 5.8 million, was the hardest hit, with 68 killed in intense rains and landslides. Damage to agriculture in Bicol, which produces rice and corn, was estimated at 342 million pesos (5.11 million pounds). Rescuers, including the police and military, used heavy-lifting equipment to clear roads leading to landslide sites and entered flooded communities using rubber boats. “The sun is already out, with occasional light rains. We hope floods will subside,” Ronna Monzon, a member of the operations personnel at the disaster agency in Bicol, told Reuters. About 20 tropical cyclones hit the Philippines every year, with destroyed crops and infrastructure taking a toll on human lives and weighing down one of the fastest growing economies in Asia.",0
 President Donald Trump said U.S. security officials will make a plea for a southern border wall in a White House meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday and that he was open to working on a path to legal status for so-called Dreamers. Trump’s demand for $5 billion for the border wall to be part of any spending measure triggered a partial federal government shutdown on Dec. 22. The White House invited Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to an afternoon meeting with senior Homeland Security officials.,0
" Two women defied a centuries-old ban on entering a Hindu temple in the Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, sparking protests and calls for a strike by conservative Hindu groups outraged by their visit. Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse a large crowd of protesters in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, television news channels showed. There were protests in several other cities in the state, media reported. India’s Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on women or girls of menstruating age from entering the Sabarimala temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year. But the temple refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit it had been blocked by thousands of devotees. The Kerala state government is run by left-wing parties and it has sought to allow women into the temple - a position that has drawn the criticism of both of India’s main political parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The uproar has put the issue of religion, which can be highly contentious in India, squarely on the political agenda months before a general election, which is due by May. The possibility of more confrontations was raised by a call from an umbrella group of right-wing Hindu groups in Kerala, the Sabarimala Karma Samithi, which is supported by the BJP, for a state-wide protest strike on Thursday. The BJP called for protesters to be peaceful. Earlier, the Kerala state president of the BJP described the women’s visit as “a conspiracy by the atheist rulers to destroy the Hindu temples”. The party’s state president, P.S Sreedharan Pillai, told TV channels the BJP would “support the struggles against the destruction of faith by the Communists”. “Let all the devotees come forward and protest this,” he said. Officials from the main opposition Congress party in the state, in a rare alignment with their main rival for power at the national level, the BJP, also called for protests. “This is treachery ... The government will have to pay the price for the violation of the custom,” K. Sudhakaran, vice-president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, said in a statement. Conservative Hindu groups say they believe women of menstruating age would defile the temple’s inner shrine. The ban was imposed on all females between the ages of 10 and 50. News channels reported the chief priest briefly shut the temple for “purification” rituals after the women visited. Later, media reported it had re-opened. The two women, identified by police as Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanaka Durga, 44, had tried to go in on Dec. 24, and later approached police for help, an officer said. “There was an elaborate arrangement for them to come just after the temple was opened early morning,” said the officer, who declined to be identified fearing reprisals from protesters. “The darkness gave them, and us, cover.” Police were guarding the homes of the women after they left the temple and were prepared to let more women enter the temple, he said. A video from a police official posted online by ANI showed two women in the temple with their heads covered. Ammini told a television channel about their stealthy trek to the temple in the middle of the night. “We reached Pampa, the main entry point to the temple at 1.30 a.m. and sought police protection ... We walked two hours, entered the temple around 3.30 a.m. and did the darshan,” the woman said, referring to a ritual of standing in front of the temple’s Hindu image. The state government defended its decision to protect the women as they went into the temple, saying it was a matter of civil rights. “I had earlier made it clear that the government will provide protection if any women come forward to enter the temple,” said Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Vijayan told a news conference the women faced no obstruction on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how they managed to avoid devotees guarding the temple. On Tuesday, the state government backed a protest by thousands of women, who formed a 620 km (385 mile) human chain, termed the “women’s wall”, in support of “gender equality” and access to the temple. Modi, in an interview with ANI on Tuesday, indicated he felt that the temple issue was more about a religious tradition than gender equality. Modi said there were temples where men were barred from entering.",0
" Thieves used mechanical diggers on Wednesday to prise open an armoured van on a highway in southern Italy and made off with more than 2 million euros (£1.8 million pounds) in cash, police said. The blue security van had left the city of Bari and was carrying pensions to be distributed in post offices in nearby Matera when it was blocked on the road by two lorries. Two diggers then tore open the vehicle, using their mechanical arms like can openers to gain access to the cash. The lorries were then set ablaze as the hooded thieves escaped with their loot in a waiting car. The three guards in the van were unharmed.",0
" Pop singer Miley Cyrus has confirmed her marriage to teen sweetheart, actor Liam Hemsworth, posting photos taken at their quiet family wedding on social media. With the caption “10 years later” and the date “12.23.18,” the “Wrecking Ball” singer posted a trio of photos on Instagram and Twitter late on Wednesday of her in an off the shoulder white dress, hugging and kissing Hemsworth. Hemsworth, 28, posted one of the photos on his Twitter account, writing “My Love” and a heart emoji. First reports of the small Dec. 23 ceremony emerged on social media on Christmas Eve. Cyrus, the 26-year-old former Disney Channel star of comedy “Hannah Montana,” met Australian actor Hemsworth while filming their 2010 romantic film “The Last Song” and announced their engagement in 2012. After splitting up a year later, they got back together again and announced their second engagement in 2015. The home they shared in Malibu was destroyed in the November wildfires that swept through parts of southern California. Representatives for Cyrus and Hemsworth did not respond on Thursday to a request for comment but People magazine said the couple had originally planned to wed in their Malibu home. After the fire, they switched the venue for the Dec. 23 nuptials to Cyrus’s home in Franklin, Tennessee, People magazine reported.",0
" President Donald Trump made a surprise Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday, his first trip to a conflict zone nearly two years into his presidency and days after announcing a pullout of American troops from neighbouring Syria. Trump was looking for some positive headlines after several days of turmoil over his decisions to withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, pull out half of the 14,000-strong contingent in Afghanistan, and push out Defence Secretary James Mattis two months earlier than planned for criticizing his policies. Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and speaking at the Al Asad Air Base west of Baghdad, Trump defended the withdrawal from Syria and said it was made possible by the defeat of Islamic State militants. “Our presence in Syria was not open ended and it was never intended to be permanent,” he told troops wearing camouflage fatigues in a hangar at the base. He said some troops “can now return home to their families.” Many Republican and Democratic lawmakers have heaped scorn on Trump over his Syria policy, saying the fight against Islamic State is far from over and the withdrawal leaves allies in the lurch. One of those critics was Mattis, who said in a candid resignation letter last week that his views did not align with Trump’s, particularly on the treatment of U.S. allies. Mattis had planned to leave at the end of February, but Trump forced him to go on Jan. 1 after his resignation letter was made public. Trump has also drawn fire from some in the U.S. military for not having visited U.S. troops in conflict zones since taking office in January 2017, particularly after he cancelled a trip to a World War One cemetery in France last month due to rain. While there has been no full-scale violence in Iraq since Islamic State suffered a series of defeats last year, some 5,200 U.S. troops train and advise Iraqi forces still waging a campaign against the militant group. Trump spent a little more than three hours in Iraq. On his way home, he stopped for about an hour and a half at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where he shook hands and posed for pictures with some of the hundreds of troops lined up inside a hangar. After Ramstein, Trump headed back to Washington. Trump was supposed to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi but in the end they only spoke by telephone. Abdul Mahdi’s office said there was “a disagreement over how to conduct the meeting.” Iraqi lawmakers said the prime minister declined Trump’s request to meet him at the military base. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the meeting could not be arranged due to security concerns and the short notice of the trip, but she said they had a “great call” and that Abdul Mahdi accepted Trump’s invitation to the White House in the New Year. The unannounced visit in Iraq followed in the footsteps of two of Trump’s predecessors, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, who both made surprise trips to see troops. For security reasons, the visits are usually kept secret until after the president arrives. A small group of aides and Secret Service agents, and a pool of reporters, were with Trump and the first lady on the overnight flight from Washington. Trump said his main security concern was for the first lady. While in Iraq, Trump also spoke to military commanders and the U.S. ambassador. Sanders said they “came up with a powerful plan that will allow us to continue our path to total victory” over Islamic State. Unlike Syria, Trump said he had no plans to withdraw from Iraq. Trump has had an uneven relationship with America’s military. He did not have to serve during the Vietnam War after being diagnosed with bone spurs in his heels. As president-elect, Trump was drawn to the brawn of the armed forces and stacked his first Cabinet with generals, many of whom have since left his administration. Trump has also wanted to end protracted U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, and to force allies to pay more of the costs that he says fall disproportionately on American taxpayers, a point he made again on Wednesday. Trump spoke to troops gathered in a dining hall festooned with holiday decorations and teased soldiers about their favourite football teams. To reporters, he lamented the wear and tear of overseas conflicts. “It’s time to get our young people out,” Trump said. “And I’ve been signing plenty of letters and I don’t like sending those letters home to parents saying that your young man or your young woman has been killed. “I don’t like doing it. We’ve been doing it long enough.”",0

" Six people were killed when a passenger train hit a freight trailer that had blown off a wagon coming the other way on a bridge linking Denmark’s two main islands on Wednesday, officials said. The train with 131 passengers on board was heading towards the capital, Copenhagen, when it hit the trailer. Apart from the dead, 16 people were injured but were not in critical condition, police said. The accident happened shortly before 7.35 a.m. (0635 GMT) during a severe storm that hampered the rescue operation on the 18-km (11-mile) Great Belt Bridge between Zealand and Funen, Denmark’s two major islands. “This morning’s tragic accident on the Great Belt Bridge with many killed and wounded has shaken us all,” Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen tweeted. “Ordinary Danes on their way to work or on the way home from Christmas holidays have had their lives shattered.” A preliminary investigation by the Danish Accident Investigation Board showed a trailer had blown off a freight wagon onto the oncoming tracks, a spokesman said. “There was a very, very loud bang and then the train stopped,” a witness who had been onboard the train with his daughter told broadcaster TV2. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven blamed the weather. “Terrible train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark as a result of the storm Alfrida. Our thoughts are with the injured and with the families and relatives of the dead,” he tweeted. TV footage showed a severely damaged freight trailer adorned with the logo of Danish beer maker Carlsberg. Crates of beer could be seen inside. A train operated by DB Cargo, the logistics arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bahn which carries goods from Carlsberg’s Fredericia brewery to Copenhagen, was involved in the accident, a Carlsberg spokesman said. DB Cargo was on site and “doing its utmost to support the investigation”, Deutsche Bahn said in a statement. A spokesman said the trailers were fastened to the railcars with metal rods, a system in use across Europe. The bridge remained closed for trains while car traffic in both directions resumed. Danish rail operator Banedanmark said it did not expect rail traffic by to resume before Thursday. The Great Belt, part of a route that links Denmark and Sweden to Germany, carries around 21,000 train passengers and more than 27,000 vehicles each day.

" Five Yemeni hip-hop dancers thought their problems had ended when the Islamist militants who had banned them from performing were defeated in the port city of Mukalla nearly three years ago by forces backed by the United Arab Emirates. But last month Yemeni security forces briefly detained the five members of the WaxOn band, broke their equipment and only released the dancers after they had signed a document saying they would stop dancing hip-hop in public. “The police said it was a religious sin,” band member Salman Basuad said. Another band member, Mohammed Al Ameeri, said: “The officers were very violent.. They treated us as if we were terrorists.” Local security forces did not respond immediately to Reuters’ request for comment. WaxOn band leader Mohammed Basaud said the ban reminded him of the “al Qaeda era” when the dancers were also barred from performing in public. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) ran a mini-state in the southern port city of Mukalla in 2015-16 before being defeated by forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition, which intervened in Yemen’s civil war to restore its ousted president, Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi. Since AQAP was driven out, Mukalla has been largely peaceful compared to the rest of Yemen, which has been devastated by nearly four years of fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthis. WaxOn, formed in 2014, resumed their public performances in 2016, dancing at graduation and birthday parties among other events. Yemenis like coming to the main square of Mukalla to watch the street performers for free. Basaud, said Mukalla’s residents accepted WaxOn and would offer them money to perform, allowing them sometimes to make as much as 40,000 Yemen rials (£127) for a 10-minute performance. He said the security forces had not moved against other bands performing traditional Yemeni dances on the square. “We just want the security forces to accept our position.. Our equipment and other things were damaged and lost. If they will not compensate us, at least they should cancel those unnecessary pledges they took from us (not to dance),” he said.",0
" A convoy of Syrian Kurdish fighters has pulled out of the flashpoint area of Manbij in northern Syria, close to territory controlled by Turkey, Syria’s defence ministry said on Wednesday. Some 30 km (20 miles) from the Turkish border, the town occupies a critical spot on the map of the Syrian conflict, near the junction of three separate blocks of territory that form spheres of Russian, Turkish and - for now - U.S. influence. “According to information, approximately 400 Kurdish fighters have left Manbij so far,” the Syrian defence ministry said. Their departure was in line with an agreement “for the return of normal life to the area of northern Syria,” it said. The ministry showed online a video of dozens of vehicles travelling along an unmade road carrying armed fighters, some waving the flags of the Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia and its female counterpart the YPJ. The YPG is the strongest element in the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF), a coalition of militias that the United States has backed in its campaign against Islamic State, helping it capture swathes of north and east Syria. Fearing an attack by Turkey after a U.S. pull-out from Syria, the YPG asked Syrian government forces to deploy in the area around Manbij. There was no immediate comment from the YPG or the SDF on the withdrawal or on how many fighters might remain in Manbij. Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group tied to the PKK inside its own borders, and has staged incursions into Syria in support of Syrian rebels to push it from the Turkish frontier. As a result of one of those incursions, Turkish-backed forces have held an area bordering Manbij since 2016, and Ankara has repeatedly demanded that the YPG leave the area and cross to the east bank of the Euphrates. The YPG previously announced it had pulled its forces out of Manbij and has said fighters still in the area belonged to a local militia allied to the SDF. U.S. forces have underpinned stability in Manbij since Islamic State’s defeat there in 2016, and have conducted joint patrols with Turkish forces since November in an effort to allay Ankara’s security concerns.

" Hindu nationalists linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party urged him on Wednesday to push through laws to allow the building of a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque, a flashpoint in tensions with minority Muslims. A long-running dispute over the site in the northern town of Ayodhya has flared back into life in recent months in the build-up to national elections due before May. The Supreme Court is weighing petitions from both communities on what should be built there and Modi told Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday that the judicial process should take its course. A day later, Alok Kumar, the international working president of Vishva Hindu Parishad, responded: “The Supreme Court is taking its own sweet time and Hindus can’t wait endlessly to see a temple there.” “We’ll persuade the government of Prime Minister Modi to issue legislation to start the process of a grand temple in Ayodhya,” he told journalists. He wanted the legislation in place before the government’s term ends, he added. A Hindu crowd tore down the mosque in 1992, triggering riots that killed about 2,000 people across India, in one of the worst instances of communal violence since the partition of the country in 1947. Vishva Hindu Parishad, also known as the World Hindu Council, has been spearheading a campaign over the past three decades to build a temple on the site of what Hindus say is the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities. Over the past few months, the group allied to Modi’s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has organised rallies of tens of thousands of activists, monks and other supporters, at a time of growing political and cultural tensions. At the other end of the country from Ayodhya, in the southern state of Kerala, two women defied a centuries-old ban on entering a Hindu temple on Wednesday, sparking protests and calls for a strike by conservative Hindu groups outraged by their visit.

" A federal judge has dismissed lawsuits seeking to hold Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) liable to victims of the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California for letting Islamic State flourish on their social media platforms. In a decision late Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said the attack, which killed 14 people and injured 22 others, was not the direct result of the companies’ alleged providing of resources to Islamic State. “A contrary conclusion poses boundless litigation risk and is not tenable given how interconnected communication services are with modern economic and social life,” the judge wrote. Beeler also found no liability for aiding and abetting terrorism under the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), finding allegations only that the companies were “generally aware” that Islamic State used their services. The plaintiffs included victims and relatives of victims of the Dec. 2, 2015 attack at a government building by Syed Farook, 28, a U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and his wife Tashfeen Malik, 29, a native of Pakistan. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. Both died soon after the attack in a police shootout. Islamic State said Farook and Malik were two of its followers. Beeler dismissed the lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they cannot be filed again, citing other courts’ rejections of similar claims in other cases. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by users. Keith Altman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, on Wednesday said the decision was “not a surprise,” and that issues including the impact of JASTA and what constitutes direct liability should be addressed at the appellate level. Facebook, Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc. Altman plans on Jan. 15 to ask the federal appeals court in Cincinnati to revive a similar lawsuit against the three companies over the June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people. The shooter, New York-born Omar Mateen, who was later killed by police, had pledged allegiance to Islamic State’s leader. The cases are Clayborn et al v Twitter Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-06894; and Megalla et al v Twitter et al in the same court, No. 18-00543.",0

" Netflix withdrew an episode of the comedy show “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj” from its Internet streaming service in Saudi Arabia after officials of the kingdom complained, the company said on Wednesday. The episode of the news-comedy program in question criticized the country over the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year at the kingdom’s consulate in Turkey. Amnesty International denounced “Saudi Arabia’s censorship of Netflix” as “further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression”. Khashoggi had been an outspoken critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler. The kingdom has since acknowledged publicly that the columnist, who was a permanent U.S. resident, died in its custody. “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and removed this episode only in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal demand from the government — and to comply with local law,” a Netflix spokesperson said. “This demand was consistent with Saudi law and so we have removed it in Saudi only,” the spokesperson said, adding that the move “doesn’t mean we agree with these laws”. Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment. In the episode, first aired in the United States in October, Minhaj said, “Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim and as an American.” He also criticized the kingdom for its involvement in the Yemen war and described it as being autocratic. The Netflix spokesperson added that the Saudi government had not asked the company to remove the clips from YouTube, and it had not done so. “The authorities have previously used anti cyber-crime laws to silence dissidents, creating an environment of fear for those who dare to speak up in Saudi Arabia,” Amnesty’s Middle East director of campaigns Samah Hadid said. “By bowing to the Saudi Arabian authorities’ demands, Netflix is in danger of facilitating the Kingdom’s zero-tolerance policy on freedom of expression and assisting the authorities in denying people’s right to freely access information,” Hadid said in a statement.",0

" The number of British shoppers hitting the post-Christmas sales dipped by 4.2 percent year-on-year on Wednesday, offering no relief for struggling stores that had already discounted heavily to encourage spending in the run-up to the holiday. Out-of-town stores and shopping centres were hit harder than towns and cities, but visits to both fell for the third year in a row, according to data for the first hours of trading on the morning after Christmas. Shopping centre visits were down 6.7 percent by midday, market research firm Springboard said, while traditional town and city shopping streets saw a 2.8 percent drop. Britain’s retailers had been hoping Christmas would revive spending after a bleak year for much of the sector that has seen a string of chains go out of business or announce shop closures. The sector has faced uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, rising labour costs and higher business property taxes as well as unseasonably warm weather. Stores were pinning hopes on a surge in shoppers seeking bargains to counter poor trading in November and early December. Clothing chains such as Primark (ABF.L), Superdry (SDRY.L) and online retailer ASOS (ASOS.L) warned of weak sales earlier in December, after what Sports Direct (SPD.L) owner Mike Ashley said was “the worst November in living memory” for retailers. Springboard said one reason for the drop in footfall was the almost continuous discounting, particularly since November’s Black Friday. “However, many retailers offer greater discounts online than in store, which discourages shoppers to visit retail destinations and bricks and mortar stores,” Springboard said. Springboard said many people were eating and drinking as well as visiting shops, a trend that was benefiting high streets, where there were more restaurants and other venues, more than retail parks. London’s Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street saw a 15 percent increase in footfall year-on-year by 10.30 on Wednesday, the New West End Company said, and it forecast 50 million pounds would be spent in the district by the end of the day. “International tourists are out in force driven by the weaker pound, as well as domestic shoppers who are looking for a day out after family celebrations yesterday,” said chief executive Jace Tyrrell.",0
" Government and security officials must “up their game” to tackle the illegal use of drones at airports which brought chaos to London’s Gatwick airport in the run-up to Christmas, Britain’s most senior police officer said on Thursday. Three days of drone sightings at Britain’s second busiest airport lead to about 1,000 flight cancellations and disrupted the travel of 140,000 passengers in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind. London’s Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said no police force around the world could be sure of preventing the problem posed by drones at airports. “I think the whole country and certainly the government will have watched what’s gone on and said we need to up our game here,” Dick told BBC radio. “You won’t find a police service in the world I think who would be sitting complacently thinking: ‘well we could always deal with a drone’.” The drones were first spotted at Gatwick on Dec. 19. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway, the drones returned and authorities only regained control over the airfield after the army deployed military technology to guard the area. Security Minister Ben Wallace said on Monday that Britain’s security forces now had detection systems that could be deployed across the country to combat the drone threat. “The drone technology is always changing. We have to keep up with that. There are a whole variety of tactics and technologies that we are now using, can use and in the future they will have to change again I’m sure,” said Dick. “I’ve been talking to colleagues around the world. I can tell you this is not an easy problem. We are doing our very best here and going into the future I’m sure working closely with others we will get better and better.” The police investigation into the Gatwick incident is ongoing. Detectives on Sunday released without charge two people they had suspected of flying the drones. Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by up to five years in prison. “We need to work even more closely with the private companies, we need to work even more closely with the military, we need to try to be able to prevent the criminal use of drones for whatever motivation near our airports,” Dick said.",0
" China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful “reunification” with the self-ruled island that has a bright future under any future Chinese rule, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. Taiwan is China’s most sensitive issue and is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory. Xi has stepped up pressure on the democratic island since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party became president in 2016. Tsai rejected Xi’s call and instead urged China to embrace democracy. Xi has set great personal store in resolving what the Communist Party calls the “Taiwan issue”, holding a landmark meeting with then Taiwan president Ma Ying-jeou in Singapore in late 2015, just before Tsai was elected. Xi spoke at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on the 40th anniversary of a landmark Taiwan policy statement. He said “reunification” must come under a one-China principle that accepts Taiwan as part of China, anathema to supporters of Taiwan independence, adding that the “one country, two systems” model of autonomy, with which China governs Hong Kong, was the best way for Taiwan. China translates the word “tong yi” as “reunification”, but it can also be translated as “unification”, a term in English preferred by supporters of Taiwan independence who point out the Communist government has never ruled Taiwan and so it cannot be “reunified”. The vast majority of Taiwan’s people are clearly aware that Taiwan independence would lead to a “grave disaster”, Xi told an audience that included Taiwan business people and senior party officials. “Chinese people don’t attack other Chinese people. We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification,” Xi said. “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures” to achieve this goal and prevent Taiwan independence, he said. This, though, was aimed at foreign forces who sought to interfere and the tiny minority of Taiwan independence forces and their activities, Xi said without elaborating in what was likely a reference to the United States, Taiwan’s strongest backer. Speaking to reporters, Tsai said Taiwan would never accept “one country, two systems” and was proud of its democratic way of life. “The vast majority in Taiwan resolutely oppose ‘one country, two systems’, This is the ‘Taiwan consensus’,” she said. “We call on China to bravely step forward for democracy, for only by doing so can it truly understand the people of Taiwan’s thinking and insistence.” Xi reiterated that China was willing to talk with any party in Taiwan to push the political process - stalled by China since Tsai took office - as long as they accept the “one China” principle. Underscoring China’s nervousness about U.S. support in particular for Taiwan, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which reaffirms the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Xi sought to reassure people in Taiwan that there was nothing to fear from Chinese rule, even though most people there have shown no interest in being run by autocratic Beijing. “After peaceful reunification, Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives. With the great motherland’s support, Taiwan compatriots’ welfare will be even better, their development space will be even greater,” Xi said. Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo with China, said on Tuesday China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on the island internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies. Taiwan is gearing up for presidential elections in a year. Tsai’s party suffered stinging losses to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November. Xi was speaking on the anniversary of the “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan” on Jan. 1, 1979, when China declared an end to what had been routine artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled offshore islands and offered to open up communication between the two sides. However, the offer was rebuffed by Taiwan’s then-president Chiang Ching-kuo, who in April that year came out with a “three nos” policy of no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China. Chiang only relaxed that in 1987, allowing people in Taiwan to visit China for family reunions. His father, Chiang Kai-shek, fled with defeated Nationalist forces to Taiwan in December 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists.",0
" The powerful Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah believes a solution to be “very close” for the country’s impasse over forming a new government, one of its senior officials said on Wednesday, following nearly eight months of political wrangling. Lebanese politicians have been unable to agree a new government since a general election in May as rival parties have competed over the allocation of cabinet positions, further unsettling the country’s fragile economy. Hezbollah, a heavily armed, Iran-backed movement set up in the 1980s to combat Israeli occupation, started taking part in electoral politics in the 1990s and is the most powerful group in the country. “We believe the solution is very close,” said Mahmoud Qamati, deputy head of the group’s political council, and suggested it could happen in time to be considered “a holiday gift”. “The intentions held by everybody are positive and for the benefit of the country,” he added. On Tuesday, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said he and President Michel Aoun had met and were “determined to form a government”, state news agency NNA reported. A breakthrough to create a national unity government in line with Lebanon’s sectarian power-sharing system seemed close last month, but it did not work out and the deadlock resumed. However, Hariri said on Sunday he still believed the government would form early in the new year. The lack of a government has caused particular concern because Lebanon faces both structural economic problems and regional instability. Lebanon has the world’s third-highest level of debt to GDP and Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said on Sunday it faces an economic crisis that he warned could turn into a financial one. Hariri has pledged to carry out economic reforms that could unlock billions of dollars of international investment in Lebanese power, transport and data infrastructure, aimed at boosting the economy after years of weak growth. The International Monetary Fund has stressed the importance of Lebanon putting its debt on a sustainable footing, while bond yields and the cost of insuring against Lebanese sovereign debt have shown signs of stress in recent months. Last month, Israel uncovered several tunnels it said Hezbollah had dug under the border, adding to tensions between the countries some 12 years after Israel and Hezbollah fought a war on Lebanese soil. Qamati said the government formation was beneficial “particularly in light of the Israeli dangers”. The latest hitch in efforts to form a government came over Sunni Muslim representation in the cabinet. Hariri said on Tuesday that only one difficulty remained and that he and Aoun were working to solve it.

" Taliban fighters detonated explosives planted in a tunnel below an Afghan military outpost, killing five soldiers, a police official said on Wednesday. Six soldiers were wounded in the attack on Tuesday in the Maiwand district of the southern province of Kandahar, police spokesman Mohammad Ashraf Watandost said. A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, said the militants, fighting to overthrow the government and reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster, had killed or wounded 35 soldiers and destroyed a large cache of weapons and ammunition. Afghan border security forces separately thwarted an attack on Italian military advisers at a paramilitary base in the western province of Herat on Wednesday. Noorullah Qadri, the commander of 207 Zafar military corps, said two attackers who had infiltrated the border security forces tried to kill the Italians. “The Italian nationals escaped uninjured. One attacker was gunned down immediately and the other was arrested,” said Qadri. The Italian forces are part of the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission focused on training, advising and assisting the Afghan forces in four western provinces. Italy has 895 soldiers attached to Resolute Support. Officials at the Italian embassy in Kabul were not immediately available for comment.",0
" Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate and incoming U.S. senator from Utah, sharply criticized President Donald Trump and suggested the U.S. leader had caused dismay around the world. In a Washington Post essay published on Tuesday evening, Romney criticized a number of Trump’s actions in December. “The appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs all defined his presidency down,” he wrote. He added that “Trump’s words and actions have caused dismay around the world.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Romney suggested that “on balance, (Trump’s) conduct over the past two years ... is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.” Romney is staking out an independent position two days before he takes office on Thursday. It is unclear whether Trump will face a serious challenge in 2020 to securing the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. Trump last February endorsed Romney’s run for a Senate seat in Utah. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump as a “fraud” who was “playing the American public for suckers.” Trump responded that Romney had “choked like a dog” in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign against Democratic President Barack Obama. Despite Romney’s prior criticism, after Trump won the presidency in November 2016, he briefly considered tapping Romney as secretary of state. In his essay on Tuesday, Romney said he “will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.” Romney has strongly defended press freedom and challenged Trump’s repeated attacks on some news outlets as an “enemy of the people.” “The media is essential to our Republic, to our freedom, to the cause of freedom abroad, and to our national security. It is very much our friend,” Romney wrote in an essay in November.",0
" German prosecutors have charged a man arrested on New Year’s day with attempted murder after he rammed his car into crowds of revellers in two separate attacks, police said on Wednesday. The 50-year-old German was detained after he drove his Mercedes into people celebrating the New Year in the western cities of Bottrop and Essen in a suspected hate crime in which eight foreigners were injured. Police in the city of Munster said a judge had approved a request by prosecutors to formally charge him with multiple counts of attempted murder. All but one of the eight people injured were from Syria and Afghanistan. An eighth man who suffered a leg injury was identified as a 34-year-old German-Turk from Essen. A Syrian woman who suffered life-threatening injuries is recovering in hospital after an emergency operation, police said. The suspect had made racist remarks when police officers detained him near Essen, police said.",0
" U.S. border agents launched tear gas into Mexico early on Tuesday to deter a group of migrants that one official called “a violent mob” from crossing over from Tijuana, according to a Reuters witness and the U.S. government. Clouds of the noxious gas could be seen wafting up from around the fence at the border. One migrant picked up a canister and threw it back into U.S. territory. U.S. officials said the group had attacked agents with projectiles but a Reuters witness did not see any migrants throwing rocks at U.S. agents. Tijuana has become a flashpoint in the debate over U.S. immigration policy, which has been intensified by the recent deaths of two migrant children in American custody and a partial U.S. government shutdown over U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) in funding for a wall along the border with Mexico. A previous incident in November when U.S. agents fired gas into Mexico to disperse migrants triggered a call from Mexico’s government for an investigation, as well as international condemnation. Mexico Foreign Ministry spokesman Roberto Velasco said the government “regrets the events” at the border. He said Mexico “advocates respect for migrants’ human rights, security and integrity, while calling for respect for laws on both sides of the border.” More than 150 Central American migrants approached an area of the border in Tijuana in the Playas neighbourhood near the beach late on Monday. Migrants said they thought security measures might be relaxed due to the New Year’s holiday. U.S. security personnel fired tear gas into Mexico after midnight as some migrants prepared to climb a border fence, according to the Reuters witness. During a second attempt, migrants began to pass youths and children over the razor wire along the fencing to the U.S. side. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman called the group “a violent mob” and said they had thrown projectiles at agents who responded with “the minimum force necessary to defend themselves.” “Congress needs to fully fund the border wall,” Waldman said in a statement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement the gas was aimed upwind of people throwing rocks on the Mexican side who obstructed agents from helping the children being passed over razor wire. The CBP statement said agents had not directly targeted the migrants attempting to cross the fence with tear gas and pepper spray. A Reuters witness documented in one photo where a migrant had been hit by what appeared to be a gas canister. Human rights group Amnesty International’s deputy director of research Justin Mazzola described the use of tear gas against migrants “cruel and inhumane” and called for an independent investigation. “The Trump administration is defying international law and orchestrating a crisis by deliberately turning asylum-seekers away from ports of entry, endangering families who see no choice but to take desperate measures in their search for protection,” he said in a statement. CBP said most of the migrants attempting to cross returned to Mexico while 25 people, including two teenagers, were detained. Thousands of Central American migrants have been camping at shelters in Tijuana since arriving in November after travelling in caravans across Mexico to reach the U.S. border, where many have hoped to request asylum. Mexico’s new leftist president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sought not to antagonize Trump over the U.S. president’s demands for a border wall. He obtained a pledge from the United States to contribute billions of dollars for development in Mexico’s poor south and Central America in order to deter migration. Trump has backed away from his campaign pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall, but just last week he threatened to close the border with Mexico unless he gets the money he wants from U.S. lawmakers for a barrier. The United States has also pushed Mexico to house Central American migrants while they seek U.S. asylum.",0

" Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday the island would not accept a “one country, two systems” political arrangement with China, while stressing all cross-strait negotiations needed to be on a government-to-government basis. Tsai spoke after Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a speech earlier on Wednesday that nobody can change the fact that Taiwan is part of China, and that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should seek “reunification”. Tsai also urged China to understand Taiwanese people’s thinking and needs. In a new year’s speech earlier this week, Tsai said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values.

" Russian rescuers were on Monday searching for people still trapped under the rubble of a city apartment block that partly collapsed in a suspected gas blast, killing at least three, RIA said. Russia’s emergencies ministry told the news agency that four people had been recovered alive from the nine-storey building in Magnitogorsk, an industrial city some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow in the southern Urals. News agency TASS said 79 people were unaccounted for, quoting Chelyabinsk regional Deputy Governor Oleg Klimov. The emergencies ministry said the blast, probably caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments. RIA said it ripped through the building at around 0600 a.m. (0100 GMT) when many residents were asleep. Monday is a public holiday in Russia. There have been several similar incidents in Russia in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas usage. In 2015, at least five people were killed when a gas explosion damaged an apartment building in the southern Russian city of Volgograd.",0
" European Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said on Thursday there is still a chance that Britain’s parliament will vote in favour of the Brexit agreement in January and that there was no public support for a disorderly Brexit or another referendum. Prime Minister Theresa May has struck a withdrawal agreement with Brussels but she was forced to postpone a parliamentary vote on it earlier this month after admitting she would lose by a large margin. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. “It is not entirely unlikely that the British parliament will vote for the divorce agreement in January,” Oettinger told Funke Media Group in an interview. “There is certainly no majority for a disorderly Brexit or for a new referendum.” Oettinger said that the likelihood of Britain remaining in the EU had increased slightly over the past few months. “Nevertheless, I assume that it will come to an exit at the end of March,” said Oettinger, the EU’s budget commissioner.",0
" Earnings at China’s industrial firms in November dropped for the first time in nearly three years, as slackening external and domestic demand left businesses facing more strain in 2019 in a sign of rising risks to the world’s second-largest economy. The gloomy data points to a further loss of economic momentum as a trade dispute with the United States piles pressure on China’s vast manufacturing sector and as firms, bracing for a tough year ahead, shelve their investment plans, executives say. Industrial profits fell 1.8 percent in November from a year earlier to 594.8 billion yuan (68.2 billion pounds), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Thursday. It marked the first decline since December 2015. The fall in profits largely reflected slowing growth in sales and producer prices as well as rising costs, He Ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. Economists expect earnings to continue to worsen next year, weighed down by smaller gains in industrial prices due to cooling demand, with some even warning of the risk of deflation. “Soft economic indicators such as producer prices, industrial output and orders all point to further pressure on corporate profitability,” said Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based analyst at Hwabao Trust, adding that firms’ revenues have been hit by shrinking demand. “Industrial profits next year might very well post a 5-10 percent decline on average.” In November, China’s factory price growth slowed to the weakest pace in two years as domestic demand lost further momentum. “Survival is paramount for us (next year) – we will be more cautious with our investments,” Jiang Ming, chairman of Henan-based Tianming Group that has businesses in healthcare, construction and finance, told Reuters. “We also need to maintain better cashflows and save our ammunition to prepare for the tight, tough and difficult days ahead.” China’s economy expanded at the slowest pace last quarter since the global financial crisis, hit by a years-long deleveraging campaign, cooling property market and a trade dispute with the United States, and is expected to cool further next year. The growing pressure has prompted the government to roll out a range of measures to juice up demand. In a key annual economic conference held this month the country’s top leaders said they will ratchet up support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and keeping liquidity ample, while promising to push forward trade negotiations with the United States. At the beginning of this month, U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce delaying a planned U.S. tariff hike on Jan. 1 as they negotiate a trade deal. Yet there is uncertainty whether the two sides can bridge their differences over a myriad of issues - including trade and intellectual property rights - to reach a durable pact. Earnings growth at China’s industrial firms has been cooling since April this year as factory price gains slowed on the back growing strains in the global economy. The bitter trade war with the United States has also pressured overall output and demand in a blow to business investment plans. For the first eleven months, profits at industrial firms rose 11.8 percent from the same period a year earlier to 6.1 trillion yuan, slowing from a 13.6 percent increase in January-October. In the same period, earnings growth at state-owned industrial enterprises also cooled. Upstream sectors such as oil extraction, coal and metal mining still commanded the lion’s share of profit gains in the 11-month period but again their growth softened in November. Profits for oil and natural gas extraction rose 333 percent in the first eleven months of the year, easing off from a 371 percent jump for January-October. “The next drag on profits would likely come from upstream sectors where raw material prices have been sliding fast,” Hwabao Trust’s Nie said. With the arrival of winter, industrial output has taken a hit as the government intensifies a crackdown on pollution to restrict production in smoke-belching factories. China’s top steelmaking city Tangshan asked steel mills earlier this month to cut extra output during December 9 and 31, which is an additional reduction on top of that ordered during the winter heating season. All of this pointed to more bad news for businesses next year. “We expect the downtrend in industrial profit growth to extend into 2019 given weakening domestic demand, the continued credit downcycle and an escalation in the China-US trade conflict,” Nomura analysts said in a note to clients.",0
" Myanmar youth activist and television host Thinzar Shun Lei Yi would once have called herself one of Aung San Suu Kyi’s greatest fans. Now, she is one of her most vocal critics. The 27-year-old belongs to a small but high-profile group of liberal activists, many former die-hard Suu Kyi supporters, who are growing increasingly disillusioned with the administration they voted into power with sky-high hopes three years ago. “I lost my idol, I’m confused, frustrated and lost,” said Thinzar Shun Lei Yi, who hosts an ‘Under 30’ talk show on a popular local website. “Most of the activists and youths are now thinking: ‘What is next’, ‘What will happen?’, ‘What can we do?’ At this stage, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is going her own way and nobody can intervene, and she won’t listen to civil society organisations,” she said, using the honorific for women in Myanmar. While Suu Kyi continues to inspire devotion among many ordinary Burmese, the emergence of a dissenting youth movement – driven by anger over her handling of ethnic minorities, including the Muslim Rohingya, as well as curbs on the media and civil society – presents a new challenge for her administration. At stake is the future of Myanmar’s transition towards democracy after years of military rule. With a general election looming in 2020, the country’s first civilian government in decades is confronted by growing divisions among activists who once coalesced around her National League for Democracy party. NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said the party was trying to win over young people, increasing the budget for education and supporting vocational training programmes. “The youth and the people expected a lot from our government,” he said. “We couldn’t live up to their expectations, we admit. But we are doing our best.” Suu Kyi took power in 2016 after a landslide election win, vowing to continue democratic reforms and end the country’s long-running civil wars. Since then, the administration has come under pressure over its response to a military crackdown against the Rohingya minority that the United Nations has described as “ethnic cleansing” with “genocidal intent”, as well as faltering peace talks with ethnic armed groups and a stagnating economy. Activists say the civilian government has also become increasingly authoritarian, failing to use its overwhelming parliamentary majority to scrap colonial-era laws used to stifle dissent, while tightening restrictions on civil society. In recent months, they have staged several protests, including an anti-war march in the commercial capital of Yangon in May that ended in scuffles. A total of 17 people were charged with unlawful protest, including Thinzar Shun Lei Yi. Their trial is ongoing. “Sensitive issues are banned, and protesters arrested and beaten,” she said. “The National League of Democracy, the party using the name of democracy, must respect democracy and human rights.” According to free speech organization Athan, which means ‘Voice’ in Burmese, 44 journalists and 142 activists have faced trial since the Suu Kyi government took power. They include Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were sentenced to seven years in prison in September after being convicted of breaking the colonial era Official Secrets Act. The journalists are appealing their conviction to the country’s High Court, citing evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime. Suu Kyi said in September their jailing had nothing to do with freedom of expression. The government says Myanmar’s courts are independent. Athan’s founder, poet and activist Maung Saung Kha, was among the protesters charged alongside Thinzar Shun Lei Yi in May. Four months later, in September, they both helped organise another demonstration, this time for free speech. Facing the crowd, Maung Saung Kha – who is still an NLD member – donned the orange shirt traditionally worn by his party’s lawmakers and draped a green jacket resembling military garb over it. Armed with a copy of the state-run daily newspaper The Mirror, he began beating journalists gathered nearby. “The government has failed to use its power to protect people’s rights,” he told Reuters. Myo Nyunt, the party spokesman, said the government was cooperating with non-governmental organisations, but their activities needed to be examined case-by-case. “If it is not related to security or not a divisive issue among ethnics, we accept them,” he said. “We are going forward to democracy so we acknowledge the role of NGOs, but we have concerns that NGOs are being influenced by sponsors instead of being independent.” While she has no control over the military, Suu Kyi has faced international criticism for failing to defend the Rohingya, more than 730,000 of whom fled a sweeping army crackdown in western Rakhine state in 2017, according to U.N. agencies. The operation was launched in response to insurgent Rohingya attacks on security forces. Myanmar denies almost all the allegations of atrocities made by refugees, saying the army was carrying out a legitimate campaign against terrorists. While many among Myanmar’s Buddhist majority revile the Rohingya, the young activists offer a rare sympathetic voice. “We acknowledge Rohingya. We totally denounce the fact that they are referred to as ‘Bengali’,” said Maung Saung Kha, referring to a term commonly used in Myanmar to imply the Rohingya are interlopers from Bangladesh, despite a long history in the country. “We haven’t seen any acknowledgement or punishment for the things that happened,” he said. “The refugees will not come back as long as these people think of them as less than humans, and that it is not a crime to kill them.” Khin Sandar, another young activist facing unlawful protest charges, spent months campaigning for the NLD ahead of the 2015 election but lost faith in Suu Kyi over her handling of the Rakhine crisis. Her family was affected in a wave of communal violence in 2012, when not only Rohingya but members of the Kaman Muslim minority, who also face discrimination but unlike the Rohingya are considered Myanmar citizens, were driven from their homes. They live in crowded internal displacement camps outside the Rakhine state capital Sittwe and are subjected to severe restrictions on movement. In a speech after last year’s violence, Suu Kyi said all residents of Rakhine “have access to education and healthcare services without discrimination”. “My own nephew and nieces are still living in the Sittwe camps and they don’t have those rights,” said Khin Sandar. “I was shocked. How can she say that in her speech?” Afterwards, she said, she quit her job as researcher for an NLD lawmaker. While the youth activists represent only a small segment of Myanmar society they are increasingly influential in the grassroots activism scene, while their protests and public comments have attracted significant attention from media and from their vast social media followings. Mostly in their 20s and 30s, they highlight the gulf between Myanmar’s young population – the median age is 27 – and its ageing leadership, comprised of mostly men in their 60s and 70s. “Myanmar is a very conservative country, these young people especially from Yangon are now challenging that,” said Myat Thu, a political analyst from the Yangon School of Political Science. “In order to have a revolution of ideas, not many people need to know. They will spread it gradually.”",0
" Myanmar police have clashed with insurgents in the troubled western state of Rakhine, state-run media said on Wednesday, as intensified fighting continued between the security forces and an armed group representing the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group. The United Nations said about 2,500 people had been driven from their homes since early December when clashes broke out with the Arakan Army, one of several groups fighting Myanmar’s army that want more autonomy for ethnic minorities. The Myanmar military last month announced a four-month halt in fighting in the north and northeast of the country in order to kick-start stalled peace talks with the armed groups. Rakhine, in the west, was excluded from the pause, stoking doubts about the military’s willingness to bring an end to all the country’s conflicts. Rakhine was where the military launched a campaign in 2017 that has driven more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims into bordering Bangladesh. Recent fighting has involved the Arakan Army, which claims to represent the Rakhine, the Buddhist ethnic group who make up the majority in the state of the same name. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said one policeman was critically injured when border guard police were attacked by about 30 men carrying “small and heavy arms” on Tuesday near Saytaung, a village in the Buthidaung area. Khine Thu Kha, a spokesman for the Arakan Army, denied that the group attacked the police, but said the group did clash with government security forces in Saytaung on Tuesday. Hundreds of border guard police had been deployed in areas far from the border with Bangladesh as part of a broader military offensive against the group, Khine Thu Kha told Reuters on Wednesday. “Today the fighting started at 8 a.m.” in another location, he said. Major General Tun Tun Nyi, a military spokesman, declined to comment. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 1,500 people were newly displaced by fighting last week in Rakhine, in addition to about 1,000 people displaced since clashes broke out on Dec. 8. Authorities, along with local and foreign aid groups, were providing aid to the displaced, the U.N. agency said in an update. (This story refiles to amend spelling of spokesman’s first name to Khine, from Khin in paragraph 7.)",0
" Australia’s government is confident it has grounds to strip an alleged Islamic State recruiter of citizenship, a minister said on Wednesday, as questions arose over whether doing so could be illegal and leave the man stateless. The case highlights the problems many governments face as they consider what action to take against people who have travelled abroad, often to the Middle East, to join militant groups. Under Australian law, a person can only be stripped of their citizenship if they are dual citizens, thereby preventing people from being made stateless. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said Melbourne-born Neil Prakash, who is imprisoned in Turkey, was a dual citizen as he also has Fijian citizenship,. Prakash ceased to be an Australian “by virtue of his actions in fighting for Islamic State from May 2016”, and he had been notified of the decision in December, Dutton said. “The advice to the government based on all the intricate detail and fact of this particular matter is that Mr Prakash is, by operation of law, a citizen of Fiji,” Dutton told reporters in Brisbane. “The other point to make is that Mr Prakash is sitting in a Turkish jail at the moment ... Prakash is not coming anywhere near our part of the world any time soon.” Prakash has been in Turkey on trial for charges relating to being a member of the Islamic State militant group since being caught there in October 2016. Australia believes Prakash is a dual national because his father was Fijian. However, Fiji’s director of immigration, Nemani Vuniwaqa, told Reuters in a Facebook message that Prakash was not Fijian, which could complicate the Australian government’s bid to strip him of his citizenship. Prakash can challenge the Australian government’s decision, Dutton said, and he could be entitled to retain his citizenship if he does not hold dual-citizenship status. The government wrongly reported in 2016, based on U.S. intelligence, that Prakash had been killed in an air strike in Mosul, Iraq. The government said he had appeared in Islamic State videos and magazines and had actively recruited Australian men, women and children, and encouraged acts of terrorism He is also wanted in Australia over terrorism-related activities including a suspected plot to behead a police officer, though an Australian push for his extradition was rejected by Turkey in July. A spokesman for the Fijian prime minister could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.",0
" Afghanistan’s neighbours, caught off-guard by reports of U.S. plans to withdraw thousands of troops, have begun preparing for the risk that a pullout could send hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing across their borders, diplomats say. Alarmed by the possibly of a chaotic withdrawal, diplomats from neighbouring countries who have been in talks with U.S. officials in Kabul said they were reassessing policies and would ramp up border preparations. “At this point there is no clarity about the withdrawal, but we have to keep a clear action plan ready,” said a senior Asian diplomat based in Kabul. “The situation can turn from bad to worse very quickly.” A White House spokesman last week said U.S. President Donald Trump had not issued orders to the Pentagon to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. But the administration has not denied reports that the United States plans to pull out almost half of the 14,000-strong force currently deployed. The reports come amid an intensification of moves towards peace negotiations in Afghanistan. U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad met Taliban representatives last month and discussed issues around a future troop withdrawal as well as proposals for a ceasefire. But even among regional powers such as Iran, Pakistan or Russia that have long been suspicious that the United States wants permanent military bases in South Asia, there is no appetite for a sudden U.S. withdrawal, say analysts. “While the news of a potential U.S. drawdown may be a reason for cautious optimism in the region, they don’t want an abrupt withdrawal,” said Graeme Smith, a consultant for the International Crisis Group. “All sides recognise that a precipitous pullout could spark a new civil war that destabilises the region. The neighbours do not enjoy surprises, and the uncertain signals from Washington are causing anxiety.” The United States, which sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country, withdrew most of its forces in 2014, but still keeps around 14,000 troops there as part of a NATO-led mission aiding the Afghan security forces and hunting militants. The top U.S. general in Afghanistan said 2019 was going to be an interesting year. “The policy review is going on in multiple capitals, peace talks out there, regional players pressing for peace, the Taliban talking about peace, the Afghan government talking about peace,” said General Scott Miller, the U.S. commander of Afghanistan’s NATO-led force, at the Resolute Support mission headquarters in Kabul. Pakistan, which was already working to fence its 1,400 km (870 miles) frontier with Afghanistan and deploy a 50,000-strong paramilitary force along the border, is preparing for a fresh influx of refugees in the event of disorder. “Camps will be set up near the border to manage a fresh wave of Afghan refugees and illegal migrants and Afghans will not be allowed to set up illegal homes in Pakistan,” said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Afghanistan, which shares borders with Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China, is already the world’s second biggest source of refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates that approximately 1.4 million undocumented Afghans live in Pakistan and possibly 1.2 million in Iran. While thousands of undocumented Afghans were driven out of Iran by recent political and economic turbulence, Iranian officials in Kabul said they fear a sudden U.S. troop withdrawal could reverse that trend. “We are working closely with the Afghan government to stop Afghans from entering our country. We don’t want to use violence to stop them, but a sudden U.S. pullout will lead to a crisis,” said an Iranian official. Afghanistan does not share a land border with Turkey, but Afghans enter Turkey from Iran to work as shepherds, farmers or in the construction sector. Many use it as a transit point to try to enter Europe. “We have not closed our door but the number of illegal migrants is increasing on a daily basis,” said Mehmet Ozgur Sak, the second secretary at the Turkish embassy in Kabul. In 2018, Turkish police say they intercepted 90,000 Afghans who were trying to enter the country with fake documents or with the help of traffickers, double the number in 2017. As negotiations over the future of the country gather momentum, the Taliban have been trying to reassure Afghans that they have nothing to fear after foreign forces leave. But there are Afghans who refuse to trust the Taliban’s new stance. Sayed Rafi Sadat, a student in western Herat province, said the Taliban would impose harsh laws to destroy democracy. “If U.S. troops withdraw then there is no hope for the future and we will have to leave the country,” he said.

" A 50-year-old German man clearly intended to kill foreigners when he rammed his silver Mercedes into a crowd of people in the northwestern German town of Bottrop in the early hours of New Year’s Day, injuring four, a senior government official said. Police said the man, who was not named, made racist comments when he was stopped and arrested in the nearby city of Essen after fleeing the scene of the attack. “A German man deliberately drove into crowds of people ... that were largely made up of foreigners. There was a clear intention by this man to kill foreigners,” Herbert Reul, interior minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Bottrop is located, told reporters on Tuesday. Earlier, police and prosecutors said they suspected the attack, which took place at a crowded plaza, was deliberate and “linked to the xenophobic views of the driver.” They said there was also preliminary information that the man was mentally ill but he had no prior police record. A police spokeswoman said Syrian and Afghan citizens were among those injured, but gave no further details. She said one of the four people injured remained in hospital. Earlier the driver had steered his car at another pedestrian, who escaped unharmed, Reul said. He also targeted people at a bus stop after fleeing the scene of the Bottrop attack, but they were not injured, police said. Horst Seehofer, Germany’s federal interior minister, told Bild newspaper the Bottrop case would be carefully investigated, along with an incident that occurred in Bavaria on Saturday in which four asylum-seekers were arrested on suspicion of attacking a dozen people. “It is a matter of political credibility to pursue both cases decisively and aggressively,” he told the paper.",0
" Honduras will hold talks with Israel, joined by the United States, aimed at opening an embassy in Jerusalem, the countries said on Tuesday, as the small Central American nation looks to follow U.S. President Donald Trump’s much-criticized move. U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez held a meeting in the Brazilian capital on the sidelines of the inauguration of right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro The three agreed to hold meetings in the capitals of each country “to advance the decision process to open embassies in both Tegucigalpa and Jerusalem,” as well as “strengthen political relations and coordinate development cooperation in Honduras,” the countries said in a joint statement. The right-leaning Hernandez is the latest leader to consider following Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested city of Jerusalem, which infuriated Palestinians and drew international condemnation. Hernandez told reporters the trilateral talks represented “an important political alliance.” Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, a poor nation of less than 10 million people, over caravans of migrants crossing Mexico heading for the U.S. border. Guatemala, another country seeking closer U.S. ties, quickly joined Trump’s decision and moved its embassy to Jerusalem just two days after the U.S. opened offices in May. Paraguay also followed, but a new government backtracked in September. Netanyahu said on Sunday that Bolsonaro told him it was a question of “when, not if” Brazil would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.",0
" Western powers on Tuesday condemned election day violence in Bangladesh and described a range of other irregularities that marred a vote in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s alliance secured more than 90 percent of parliamentary seats. The strongly-worded assessments from the UK, European Union, and United States could hit the image of Hasina, who won a third straight term to power following Sunday’s election. Hasina’s opponents have rejected the election result, citing what they describe as widespread rigging and voter intimidation. She has denied impropriety, calling it a peaceful vote that saw enthusiastic participation from her supporters. The capital Dhaka was quiet on Tuesday, but the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said its workers were being attacked in several areas elsewhere in the country by activists of the Awami League - charges the party denied. “Violence has marred the election day, and significant obstacles to a level playing field remained in place throughout the process and have tainted the electoral campaign and the vote,” the EU said in a statement, calling for “a proper examination of allegations of irregularities”. The United States, Bangladesh’s largest foreign investor, expressed concern about “credible reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence in the pre-election period that made it difficult for many opposition candidates and their supporters to meet, hold rallies, and campaign freely.” “We are also concerned that election-day irregularities prevented some people from voting, which undermined faith in the electoral process,” it said. The UK’s Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field echoed the concerns, saying he was “aware of credible accounts of obstacles, including arrests, that constrained or prevented campaigning by opposition parties. “I urge a full, credible and transparent resolution of all complaints related to the conduct of the elections,” he said. Police say at least 17 people were killed in election day clashes between supporters and opponents of Hasina’s Awami League. The two sides, which have competed for power often violently for decades, traded blame for the election day unrest. Opposition BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam said he was collecting reports of rigging to submit to the Election Commission to demand a fresh vote. The commission already rejected that plea, but Islam said: “What is our alternative?” One journalist was arrested and another was on the run after a local government official filed a case against them for publishing “false information” about election irregularities, under a new law journalists say could be used to stifle dissent. Hedayet Hussain Mollah and Rashidul Islam published reports saying more votes had been cast at one constituency in the southeastern Khulna region than the total number of registered voters there. They were accused under the Digital Security Act enacted in September. Mollah was picked up by police on Tuesday afternoon while Islam was on the run, police said. “This is false information that was made intentionally to make the election result look questionable and controversial,” a police report said. The deadly clashes on voting day marked the end of a violent campaign. The opposition said its workers faced arbitrary arrests and candidates were attacked by ruling party activists. The ruling party denied being behind any violence. “People have shared experiences of being physically assaulted and manhandled at polling stations,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s regional campaigner for South Asia, calling for an impartial probe into incidents of violence. Hasina, whose father, state founder Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in a coup in 1975, has alternated in and out of power for nearly three decades with her main rival, BNP leader Zia Khaleda. Khaleda was jailed in February for corruption. Additional reporting by Enamul Haque in Khulna and Serajul Quadir in Dhaka; Editing by Peter Graff All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" On the 60th anniversary of Cuba’s revolution, ruling Communist Party leader Raul Castro blasted the Trump administration for returning to an outdated path of confrontation with the island nation and of intervening in Latin America. Castro and his late, elder brother Fidel Castro led the rebel band that in 1959 overthrew a U.S.-backed dictator and installed a Communist-run country on the doorstep of the United States, setting the scene for decades of Cold War hostility. At the time, their revolution inspired leftist movements throughout Latin America, but the celebrations on Tuesday came as the region is shifting rightwards, coinciding with the inauguration of Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. Some of Cuba’s closest allies, Venezuela and Nicaragua, are mired in political crises, and U.S. President Donald Trump has tightened the decades-old U.S. embargo on the island, after his predecessor, Barack Obama, had sought to normalise relations. “Once again, the North American government is taking on the path of confrontation with Cuba,” Castro said in the southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba where Fidel Castro proclaimed victory six decades ago. The speech by Castro, who stepped down as president in April but remains head of the Communist Party until 2021, was part of a solemn, sunset ceremony in a cemetery where both Fidel Castro and independence hero Jose Marti are buried. “Increasingly, high-ranking officials of this administration are ... trying to blame Cuba for all the region’s ills,” he said, adding that they stemmed instead from “ruthless neoliberal policies”. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said in November that Washington would take a tougher line against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, calling them a “troika of tyranny.” Clad in military fatigues and cap, the 87-year old Castro said on Tuesday that Cuba had proven throughout six decades of revolution it could not be intimidated by threats. Instead it remained open, he said, to a peaceful and respectful coexistence. Cuba’s true battle this year was an economic one, he added, reiterating comments made at the national assembly in late December by his successor, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who announced increased austerity for the fourth year running in 2019 in the face of a cash crunch. “We need first of all to reduce all non-necessary expenses and to save more,” said Castro. A decade ago, as president, he introduced a series of reforms to liberalize and boost the centrally planned economy, yet it remains heavily state-dominated and bound in red tape. A series of external shocks such as a decline in aid from Venezuela and devastation wrought by hurricanes have also dented growth, which is sluggish at best. Nonetheless, the Cuban revolution is on a secure footing thanks to the transition to a competent younger generation of leaders such as the 58-year old Diaz-Canel, Castro said. “It is opportune to express the fact that the Cuban Communist Party decidedly backs the words and actions of Diaz-Canel since he took office,” Castro said. “The revolution has not aged, it remains young,” he said.",0
" China will not yield on issues it deems to be its core national interests, a commentary in the ruling Communist Party’s official newspaper said on Wednesday, a day after China’s president called for cooperation with the United States. “In matters related to core national interests, China has not given in, is not giving in, and will never give in,” the People’s Daily commentary said. Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump sent congratulatory messages to each other on Tuesday, marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. China and the United States face a key deadline in March for talks to end their damaging trade war. Trump has said talks towards a deal are progressing well. However, “regardless of the development of Sino-U.S. relations, China’s strategic choice to deepen reform and opening is unswerving, and we are committed to doing our own thing”, the commentary said.",0
" Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra said on Tuesday he would ask Congress to declare the public prosecutor’s office in a state of emergency after the agency’s top official removed two investigators at the heart of the probe into a massive graft scandal triggered by Brazilian builder Odebrecht. Vizcarra, who had been attending the inauguration of President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, cut short his trip to deal with the surprise twist in the Odebrecht case, saying he would return home to fight against “corruption and impunity.” Vizcarra said he would personally present a bill to Peru’s Congress at 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Wednesday seeking the state of emergency, and asked for legislative support to usher it through quickly and without conflict. “We will use all the tools our Constitution contemplates to overturn this decision, and we ask that all branches of government do the same,” Vizcarra told reporters after meeting with his cabinet and advisers in Lima. A state of emergency would allow Vizcarra to quickly and efficiently make changes to personnel he deems necessary to advance the investigation. His move came just hours after Peru’s top prosecutor, Pedro Chavarry, removed prosecutors Jose Perez and Rafael Vela, saying the duo had failed to respect authority at Peru’s public prosecutor’s office, which has overseen the investigation. Chavarry’s move prompted a public outcry in Peru, where there is strong support for Vizcarra’s anti-corruption crusade. The two deposed investigators earlier this month announced they would seek fines of about $180 million from local companies, politicians and businessmen for taking part in kickback schemes involving Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] construction projects in Peru. Odebrecht in 2016 admitted in a plea deal with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities that it had bribed officials in a dozen countries, including Peru. The team Perez and Vela helped lead has targeted people at the highest levels of power in the Andean nation. Four former Peruvian presidents, the current opposition leader and several local construction companies are all under investigation in connection with Odebrecht. All have denied wrongdoing. Chavarry’s decision to remove Perez and Vela was announced days after Perez accused Chavarry of allegedly obstructing justice in a separate case involving several judges accused of corruption. Perez and Vela had also targeted former Peruvian presidents Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Ollanta Humala y Alejandro Toledo, all of whom are under investigation in connection with the Odebrecht scandal. Vizcarra said on Monday that Odebrecht should not be able to continue working in Peru because the Brazilian construction company had “contaminated private activity” and admitted bribing public officials.",0
" President Donald Trump on Tuesday invited Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to a border security briefing at the White House as the federal government remained partially shut down over his demand to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The president’s invitation, which was described by congressional sources as a briefing and not a negotiating session, was sent to the top two Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office said he would attend the briefing, which is set for Wednesday. It was unclear whether the other leaders would participate, one source said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the specifics of the briefing. The House and Senate will reconvene briefly on Wednesday to mark the last day of the Republican-controlled 2017-2018 Congress, with no signs of a workable plan to end the shutdown, which is now in its second week. About a quarter of the federal government is shut down, with roughly 800,000 workers affected. Democrats, who won control of the House in the November elections, plan to approve on Thursday a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. But its prospects are grim in the Republican-led Senate, which previously approved similar measures on the floor or in committee but has since fallen in line with Trump’s demands for funding for the border wall. The legislation will set the stage for the first major battle of the new Congress between House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republicans led by McConnell. “We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,” Pelosi, who is expected to be the House speaker, said in a letter to colleagues released by her office on Tuesday. “Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the president’s third shutdown of his term.” Trump triggered the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion (3.92 billion pounds) in funding for the border wall be part of any spending measure. “Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let’s make a deal?” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Trump calls the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign pledge. During his run for the White House, Trump insisted Mexico would pay for the wall. The Democrats’ two-part spending package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras. The second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the Justice, Commerce and Transportation departments, through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. The House Democrats’ measure does not contain the $5 billion Trump wants in wall funding. McConnell has said Senate Republicans will not approve a spending measure not supported by Trump.",0
" President Donald Trump on Tuesday expressed confidence in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin amid worries over a weakening economy and a stock market slump, but repeated his criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve, saying it has raised interest rates too quickly. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after a Christmas video conference with U.S. troops deployed abroad, Trump also said U.S. companies were “the greatest in the world” and presented a “tremendous” buying opportunity. Asked if he has confidence in Mnuchin, Trump said: “Yes, I do. Very talented guy. Very smart person,” he said. His comments came after Mnuchin on Monday held a conference call with U.S. regulators to discuss plunging U.S. stock markets. The call did more to rattle markets than to assure them. All three major U.S. stock indexes ended down more than 2 percent on the day before the Christmas holiday. The S&P 500 has lost about 19.8 percent from its Sept. 20 closing high, just shy of the 20 percent threshold that commonly defines a bear market. Mnuchin also spoke on Sunday with the heads of the six largest U.S. banks, who confirmed they have enough liquidity to continue lending and that “the markets continue to function properly.” Investors said his move to convene a call with the president’s Working Group on Financial Markets, known as the “Plunge Protection team,” may have weighed on sentiment. On Tuesday, Trump praised U.S. companies and said their lower stock prices present an opportunity for investors. “I have great confidence in our companies. We have companies, the greatest in the world, and they’re doing really well. They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it’s a tremendous opportunity to buy.” U.S. stocks have dropped sharply in recent weeks on concerns over weaker economic growth. Trump has largely laid the blame for economic headwinds on the Fed, openly criticizing its chairman, Jerome Powell, whom he appointed. “They’re raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon,” Trump said, repeating his criticism. Media reports have suggested Trump has gone as far as discussing firing Powell, and he told Reuters in August that he was “not thrilled” with the chairman. On Monday, Trump said “The only problem our economy has is the Fed.” The Fed hiked interest rates again last week, as had been widely expected.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the partial shutdown of the federal government was going to last until his demand for funds to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is met. The U.S. government partially shut down on Saturday, and there is not yet any sign of tangible efforts to reopen agencies closed by a political impasse over Trump’s demand for border wall funds. “I can’t tell you when the government is going to reopen,” Trump said, speaking after a Christmas Day video conference with U.S. troops serving abroad. “I can tell you it’s not going to reopen until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they’d like to call it. I’ll call it whatever they want, but it’s all the same thing. It’s a barrier from people pouring into the country, from drugs.” He added: “If you don’t have that (the wall), then we’re just not opening.” Funding for about a quarter of federal programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. Without a deal to break the impasse, the shutdown is likely to stretch into the new year. Building the wall was one of Trump’s most frequently repeated campaign promises, but Democrats are vehemently opposed to it.",0
" President Donald Trump set off a Christmas social media storm when he questioned whether a seven-year-old was too long in the tooth to believe in Santa Claus. But not to worry. The child, Collman Lloyd, from Lexington, South Carolina, told the Post and Courier newspaper she was still a believer. She and her two siblings left iced sugar cookies and milk out for Saint Nick overnight and, in the morning, the treats were gone and presents were under the tree. Twitter had lit up after Trump, capping a week of plunging stocks, a government shutdown and the U.S. defence chief’s unceremonious departure, cast doubt on the cherished childhood fantasy. “Are you still a believer in Santa?” Trump asked Collman in a phone call. “Because at seven, it’s marginal, right?” In a video her family posted on the Internet, she replied “Yes sir,” later telling the newspaper she had no idea what “marginal” meant. Trump made the comment during a holiday event with first lady Melania Trump, taking calls from children calling the North American Aerospace Defense Command Santa tracker. A Christmas tradition, the tracker delights children with “real-time” updates on his Christmas Eve journey. “It’s just too freaking fantastic that Trump spent his Christmas Eve calling seven-year-olds and telling them believing in Santa at their age is ‘marginal,’” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on his Twitter account. “Actually there is no heaven,” tweeted Dan Amira, head writer for “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” comedy show. “When you die you just rot in the ground and get eaten by worms. Okay Merry Christmas, Timmy.” The White House had no immediate comment on the social media response to the president’s Santa comments. Stuck in Washington on Christmas morning because of the partial federal government shutdown, Trump displayed little holiday cheer to reporters after a 20-minute video conference with U.S. troops serving abroad. He assailed the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, railed against Democrats who refuse to fund the wall he wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border, and blasted the investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, among other regular targets. The president then closed with holiday wishes of sorts. “It’s a disgrace, what’s happening in our country,” he said. “But other than that, I wish everyone a very merry Christmas.”",0
" Armed men killed 37 Fulani civilians on Tuesday in central Mali, where ethnic violence cost hundreds of lives last year, the government said. Violence between Fulani and rival communities has compounded an already dire security situation in Mali’s semi-arid and desert regions, which are used as a base by jihadist groups with ties to al Qaeda and Islamic State. The government said in a statement that the attackers, who were dressed as traditional Donzo hunters, raided the village of Koulogon in the central Mopti region and that some of the victims were children. Moulage Guindo, the mayor of Bankass, the nearest town, said the attack occurred around the time of the first call to prayer of the new year and targeted the Fulani part of Koulogon. He said another part of Koulogon is mostly inhabited by Dogon, an ethnic group to which the Donzos are linked, less than 1 km (half a mile) away. Mali has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012, prompting French forces to intervene to push them back the following year. Islamists have since regained a foothold in the north and centre, tapping into ethnic rivalries to recruit new members.

 Brazil’s newly inaugurated far-right President Jair Bolsonaro said in his address to the nation on Tuesday that his country had been “liberated from socialism and political correctness” now that he has taken power. Bolsonaro vowed to respect democracy and carry out difficult economic reforms needed to get Latin America’s biggest economy back on track. He said that “we have a great nation to rebuild” and promised that he had put together a team of talented ministers to do just that.,0
" Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives plan to vote on Thursday on a funding package to end the 10-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown, without providing the $5 billion (3.92 billion pounds) President Donald Trump has demanded for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The planned vote sets up a Democratic showdown with Trump’s fellow Republicans on an issue dear to the president on the first day of divided government in Washington since he took office in January 2017 with a Congress led by his own party. Democrats formally take control of the House from the Republicans after winning a majority of seats in November’s congressional elections. The two-part Democratic package filed on Monday in the House includes a bill to keep funding for the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8 with no new wall funding, as well as a bundle of six measures worth nearly $265 billion combined that would fund the other shuttered agencies through the Sept. 30 end of the current fiscal year. The two parts will be voted on separately on the House floor on Thursday, said Democrats, who will hold a 36-seat majority. If approved in the House, the funding package would go to the Republican-led Senate. Its prospects there appear unpromising, although Trump’s unpredictability makes it hard to gauge how the shutdown showdown will play out. “It’s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” said a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The Democratic legislation will mark the first major battle pitting the incoming Democratic House majority led by Nancy Pelosi against Trump and McConnell. “While President Trump drags the nation into Week Two of the Trump Shutdown and sits in the White House and tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess,” Pelosi and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. Democrats oppose Trump’s demand for wall funding, with Pelosi calling the wall immoral, ineffective and expensive. Democrats hope their two-pronged funding approach will put Senate Republicans in a tough position. If they reject funding for departments unconnected to border security, Republicans could be seen as holding those agencies and their roughly 800,000 affected workers hostage to Trump’s wall demand. “Then they are complicit with President Trump in continuing the Trump shutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workers’ paychecks hostage over the wall,” Pelosi and Schumer said in their statement. Non-border-related agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, Commerce and Justice. The homeland security piece of the package includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and roughly $300 million more for other border security items including cameras and technology. Democrats said the entire package is based on legislation that has already been passed by either the Senate or Senate committees. The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22 and has idled roughly a quarter of the federal government, was precipitated by Trump’s demand, under pressure from conservative commentators, that Congress approve $5 billion to help fund a wall that was a promise made in his 2016 election campaign, although he said at the time it would be paid for by Mexico. Trump has called the wall crucial to combating illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The Senate on Dec. 21 failed to muster the votes needed to pass Republican-backed House legislation that included Trump’s wall funding. Passage in the Senate would need at least some Democratic support to reach the 60-vote threshold required. A central issue in finding a resolution could be the definition of what constitutes a wall, including the idea of steel slats and other types of barriers versus a concrete structure. Trump on Twitter criticized Democratic opposition to the wall project, which carries a total estimated price tag of $23 billion. He also seemed to contradict comments made by outgoing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. In a Los Angeles Times interview published on Sunday, Kelly said: “To be honest, it’s not a wall.” “The president still says ‘wall’ - oftentimes frankly he’ll say ‘barrier’ or ‘fencing,’ now he’s tended towards steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it,” Kelly added. Trump wrote on Twitter that border security could not exist “without a strong and powerful Wall.” “An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media,” Trump wrote. “Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!” Trump, who cancelled his vacation in Florida and has stayed at the White House during the holiday government shutdown while first lady Melania and their son Barron were at Trump’s private estate Mar-a-Lago in Florida for New Year’s Eve, said Democrats could have come over for talks anytime. “I’m in Washington. I’m ready, willing and able,” Trump told Fox News. White House officials did not reply to an email asking whether the president had been in touch directly with Democratic leaders to set up a round of talks. Pelosi has not heard formally from the White House since Dec. 11, when she and Schumer had a contentious Oval Office meeting with the president, Democratic aides said. Schumer has not heard from the White House since he met with Vice President Mike Pence and incoming White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Dec. 22, Democratic aides said.",0

" A baby boy has been found alive after 35 hours spent in freezing cold in the rubble of a Russian apartment block that partially collapsed in an explosion, emergency officials reported, calling it a miracle. The blast, thought to have been caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk on Monday, killing at least seven people with 36 people still missing. Video footage from the local emergency ministry showed a rescuer worker removing the baby dressed in pink socks and putting a blanket around it before he starts running towards an ambulance. The current temperature in the city of Magnitogorsk, home to one of Russia’s largest steel plants in the Urals some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow, is -17 Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit). The fact that the 11-month-old infant, currently diagnosed with a serious freezer burn and a closed-head injury, was lying in his bed and was wrapped up in layers saved his life, TASS news agency reported, citing a regional emergency centre. The baby was found when a rescuer heard him crying and “a large-scale operation was immediately organised,” Interfax news agency reported, citing emergency officials. His removal was difficult because of unstable debris which posed risks for rescuers. “Hundreds of people were waiting for the appearance of the injured child from under the rubble like a miracle. And the miracle happened...,” the officials were quoted as saying by Interfax. “Tears drew in the eyes of the weatherbeaten rescuers.” The boy’s mother is alive and has already arrived to the hospital, Interfax added. The blast tore through the building in the city of Magnitogorsk, home of one of Russia’s largest steel plants, early on Monday morning, a public holiday in Russia, when many residents were asleep. Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said on Monday that the chances of finding survivors were fading. There have been several similar incidents in the country in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations about gas usage.",0
" Gunmen attacked a security forces’ training base in the restive southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan on Tuesday, setting off a gunbattle in which at least four members of the security forces and four attackers were killed, officials said. The attackers apparently intended to hit a residential compound at a training centre of the paramilitary Frontier Corps in Loralai district but were challenged at the entrance, according to a statement from Inter Services Public Relations, the main military communications unit. Four members of the security forces were killed and two wounded in an initial exchange of gunfire before the attackers were isolated in an adjacent compound. Four gunmen, including one who detonated a suicide vest, were subsequently killed. “The valiant and timely action of security forces denied the terrorists entry into residential area which would have resulted in more casualties,” the ISPR statement said. The attack, in the early hours of Tuesday morning, was the latest in Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest and poorest province which is at the centre of the strategic China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructure development project. The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan or TTP, which is separate from the Afghan Taliban, claimed responsibility. Balochistan is rife with ethnic, sectarian and separatist insurgencies, and a number of militant groups, including the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army, operate in the province.",0
" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that the United States would continue to cooperate with Israel over Syria and in countering Iran in the Middle East, even as President Donald Trump plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said as he met with Pompeo in the Brazilian capital that he planned to discuss how to intensify intelligence and operations cooperation in Syria and elsewhere to block Iranian “aggression.” In his first public comments on Trump’s decision, Pompeo said it “in no way changes anything that this administration is working on alongside Israel.” “The counter-ISIS campaign continues, our efforts to counter Iranian aggression continue and our commitment to Middle East stability and the protection of Israel continues in the same way it did before that decision was made,” he said. Trump announced last month that he planned to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, declaring that they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed in the country. In making the announcement, Trump ignored the advice of top national security aides and did so without consulting lawmakers or U.S. allies participating in anti-Islamic State operations. The decision prompted Jim Mattis to resign as defence secretary. “We have a lot to discuss,” said Netanyahu, who like Pompeo was in the Brazilian capital for the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil’s new president. “We’re going to be discussing our, the intense cooperation between Israel and the United States which will also deal with the questions following the decision, the American decision, on Syria and how to intensify even further our intelligence and operational cooperation in Syria and elsewhere to block Iranian aggression in the Middle East.”Netanyahu said Israel was very appreciative of the “strong ... unequivocal support” Pompeo gave Israel’s “efforts at self defence against Syria” in the past few days. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Pompeo and Netanyahu “discussed the unacceptable threat that regional aggression and provocation by Iran and its agents poses to Israeli and regional security” and Pompeo reiterated the U.S. commitment to Israel’s security and right to self-defense. Netanyahu said last month after Trump’s announcement that Israel would escalate its fight against Iranian-aligned forces in Syria after the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Israel sees the spread of Iran’s influence in the Middle East as a growing threat, and has carried out scores of air strikes in civil war-torn Syria against suspected military deployments and arms deliveries by Iranian forces supporting Damascus.",0

" Pope Francis, in his Christmas message to the world, urged people on Tuesday to see differences as a source of richness instead of danger and called for reconciliation in places torn apart by conflict. Francis delivered the traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message to tens of thousands of people in a sunny St. Peter’s Square from the same basilica balcony where he first appeared as pontiff shortly after his election on March 13, 2013. Security has been tight around the Vatican for the Christmas season, with military jeeps stationed at key access routes and tourists undergoing metal detector and bag searches. Last week police in southern Italy arrested a Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb churches in Italy, including St. Peter’s. In his address, in what appeared to be a reference to the shrill political climate in a number of countries, Francis called for “fraternity among people with different ideas, yet capable of respecting and listening to one another”. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, alluded to polarisation over migration, saying God wanted “love, acceptance, respect for this poor humanity of ours, which we all share in a great variety of races, languages, and cultures”. “Our differences, then, are not a detriment or a danger; they are a source of richness,” he said. Francis, 82, called for the resumption of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians to “undertake a journey of peace that can put an end to a conflict that for over 70 years has lacerated the land chosen by the Lord to show his face of love”. He urged the international community to work for a political solution in Syria and said he hoped a truce brokered in Yemen’s civil war could bring relief to a population exhausted by violence and famine. The Argentinian-born pope also called for social harmony in Nicaragua and Venezuela, both racked by internal political conflicts. The millions of refugees or displaced people in Africa who are in need of humanitarian assistance and food security should not be forgotten, he said. In Ukraine, he called for “a peace respectful of the rights of every nation”. Ukraine’s relations with Russia have been locked in a downwards spiral since Moscow annexed Crimea 2014 and backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

" Food aid meant for starving Yemenis is being stolen and sold in some areas controlled by the Houthi movement, the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said on Monday. The Houthis control most towns and cities, including the capital Sanaa, from where they ousted Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s government in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition intervened against the Houthis in 2015 with the aim of restoring his government. After hearing that humanitarian food was being sold on the open market in Sanaa, WFP said it found many people had not received the food rations to which they are entitled, and that at least one local partner organisation affiliated with the Houthi Ministry of Education was committing fraud. “This conduct amounts to the stealing of food from the mouths of hungry people,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley said. “At a time when children are dying in Yemen because they haven’t enough food to eat, that is an outrage. This criminal behaviour must stop immediately.” A Houthi official expressed “deep disappointment” with the statement, saying it was “not in line with WFP practices.” “We are surprised by this position, which is not backed by evidence and proof... We welcome the formation of independent committees to investigate the violations,” said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthis’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee, in a statement sent to Reuters. Yemen’s war and the ensuing economic collapse have left 15.9 million people, 53 percent of the population, facing “severe acute food insecurity” and famine was a danger if immediate action was not taken, a survey said this month. WFP is trying to get food aid to as many as 12 million severely hungry people. It said its monitors had gathered photographic and other evidence of trucks illicitly removing food from designated food distribution centres and local officials falsifying records and manipulating the selection of beneficiaries. “It was discovered that some food relief is being given to people not entitled to it and some is being sold for gain in the markets of the capital,” the WFP statement said. Beasley said he was asking the Houthi authorities to stop food being diverted and make sure it reaches the people who need it. Herve Verhoosel, WFP spokesman in Geneva, said WFP was looking at the possibility of distributing cash to needy people, if a biometric identification system could be introduced, using personal data including iris scans and finger prints. He said Beasley had written to the Houthi leadership about the WFP findings several days ago.",0
" Thousands of demonstrators marched in Hong Kong on Tuesday to demand full democracy, fundamental rights, and even independence from China in the face of what many see as a marked clampdown by the Communist Party on local freedoms. Over the past year, countries such as the United States and Britain have expressed concerns about a number of incidents they say have undermined confidence in Hong Kong’s freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule. These include the jailing of activists, a ban on a pro-independence political party, the de facto expulsion of a Western journalist and barring democracy activists from contesting local elections. The New Year’s day march included calls to restart stalled democratic reforms and to fight “political repression” from Beijing. “Looking back at the year that passed, it was a very bad year ... The rule of law in Hong Kong is falling backwards,” said Jimmy Sham, one of the organisers. Organisers said the march drew 5,500 people, revised down from an earlier estimate of 5,800, while police said 3,200 people were on the streets at the march’s peak. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula, with the promise of a high degree of autonomy and universal suffrage as an “ultimate aim”. While authorities have clamped down hard on the city’s fringe, pro-independence movement, that didn’t deter around 100 independence activists from joining the march, holding up banners and chanting for the city to split from China. China considers Hong Kong to be an inalienable part of its territory, and denounces “separatists” as a threat to national sovereignty, even though the movement has not garnered much popular backing in the city. “There will be continuous suppression on the Hong Kong independence movement, but the movement will grow stronger and stronger,” said Baggio Leung, an independence leader who said several of his members had been harassed by purported “triads” or gangsters, before the march. Last year, in an unprecedented move, Hong Kong authorities banned a political group, the Hong Kong National Party, for its pro-independence stance on national security grounds. A western journalist, Victor Mallet, was also effectively expelled from Hong Kong, soon after he hosted a talk at a press club by the head of the National Party. Mallet’s visa denial, which the government has so far refused to explain, was criticised by some foreign governments and the American Chamber of Commerce. Some protesters carried “wanted” posters of Hong Kong’s top legal official, Theresa Cheng, criticising a decision to drop a corruption investigation into Hong Kong’s former pro-Beijing leader Leung Chun-ying, without a satisfactory explanation. “I’m afraid the pressure will continue,” said Joseph Cheng, a veteran rights campaigner and retired professor who was raising money for a “justice” fund for activists facing hefty legal fees for several trials. “We’re going to face a few difficult years, but we must stand firm ... Unlike in mainland China, at least we can still protest.”",0
" Italy’s Uffizi Galleries called on Germany on Tuesday to return a still-life painting by the Dutch master Jan van Huysum, which was looted by retreating Nazi troops in World War Two. “Germany has a moral duty to return this painting to our museum,” said Uffizi chief Eike Schmidt, who is himself German. “This story is preventing the wounds inflicted by World War Two and the horrors of Nazism from healing.” The “Vase of Flowers” painting, worth millions of dollars, was originally put on display in Florence in 1824 after it was bought by Grande Duke Leopoldo II for his art collection. The oil canvas hung in the city’s Pitti Palace until 1940, when it was evacuated to a nearby village following the outbreak of World War Two. Three years later it was seized by German troops and eventually taken to Germany where it only resurfaced following German reunification in 1991 in the hands of a family. Intermediaries have demanded payment for its return, which the Uffizi is refusing. All efforts to get it back via legal channels have failed, with Germany saying it cannot intervene because of a statute of limitations that prevents prosecution for alleged crimes committed more than 30 years ago. “Germany should not apply the statute of limitations to works of art stolen during the war,” said Schmidt, who on Tuesday hung a black and white photograph of the missing canvas in the Pitti Palace museum. The word “stolen” written in Italian, English and German is prominently printed on the photo and the picture was put on the Uffizi’s Twitter feed.",0
" Democratic Republic of Congo’s government cut internet connections and SMS services across the country for a second straight day on Tuesday as the country nervously awaited results from the weekend’s chaotic presidential election. Both the opposition and ruling coalition said on Monday they were on track to win after a turbulent election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems. Barnabe Kikaya bin Karubi, a senior adviser to President Joseph Kabila, said internet and SMS services were cut to preserve public order after “fictitious results” began circulating on social media. “That could lead us straight towards chaos,” Kikaya told Reuters, adding the connections would remain cut until the publication of complete results on Jan. 6. The signal to Radio France Internationale (RFI), one of the most popular news sources in Congo, was also down, and the government withdrew the accreditation of RFI’s main correspondent in the country late on Monday for having aired unofficial results from the opposition. The various moves reflected high tensions in Congo, where the long-delayed election was meant to choose a successor to Kabila, who is due to step down next month after 18 years in power - and two years after the official end of his mandate. Congo has never seen a democratic transfer of power, and any disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed the 2006 and 2011 elections and a wider security breakdown in its volatile eastern provinces. The opposition says the election was marred by fraud and accused Kabila of planning to rule from the sidelines through his preferred candidate, former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Internal U.N. reports, seen by Reuters, noted allegations of irregularities across the country. In some parts of eastern Congo’s North Kivu province, for example, militia fighters reportedly forced voters to select candidates from the ruling coalition, they said. In other places, the United Nations received reports that security forces intimidated voters to choose ruling coalition candidates. The government and national electoral commission (CENI) said the election was fair and that any problems were minor. In the eastern city of Goma, residents were on edge as they awaited the results. “If the results during the publication of the presidential results don’t reflect the truth ... trouble will break out across the city,” said Fabrice Shweka, a Goma resident. The first partial results were initially expected on Tuesday but CENI spokesman Jean-Pierre Kalamba said that they would not be ready until around Friday. “We don’t want to release too many voting trends (before Jan. 6) because in our country we don’t have a population that has the same understanding (of electoral practice as in Europe),” he told Reuters. In a statement late on Monday, the embassies in Congo of the European United, United States and several other countries called for calm and urged the government to restore internet access. Shadary faced off in Sunday’s poll against two main opposition challengers, Felix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu, both of whom opinion polls before the vote showed running ahead of Shadary. Fayulu complained in a statement on Monday about irregularities during Sunday’s vote but said he was encouraged by the determination of Congolese to vote despite long queues and voting machines that broke down. “I call for vigilance across the board and the general mobilisation of all Congolese so that the truth of the ballot box, the sole witness to the will of the Congolese people, can reward their efforts and sacrifices,” he said.

" India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is confident of doing well at this year’s general election despite the party’s recent losses in state polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an interview with Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday. “No reason for morale down. We are confident and are moving ahead. In 2019, if there is one party which the country trusts and is connected with the people, it is the BJP,” Modi said. India’s ruling party lost power in three key states in December, handing Modi his biggest defeat since he took office in 2014 and boosting the Congress party opposition and its allies ahead of national polls due by May. Modi said it was more important to focus on his government’s achievements, including the introduction in September of a new healthcare scheme for the poor. “In such big numbers people suffering, today they have got treatment, how can I consider this a failure. It is my biggest achievement,” Modi said. He said party has been discussing what it lacked at the state elections but winning or losing was not the only yardstick. The Hindu nationalist BJP was willing to work with regional parties in the run-up to the general election, he said. “Our effort is to take everyone along, and listen to everyone. I am committed to give importance to regional aspirations. The country cannot be run by ignoring regional aspirations.” Modi said farm loan waivers should be “definitely done” if it helps but that was not a long-term solution to the problem of farmer distress. “What is lacking in our system, that farmer becomes debt-ridden and the governments have to repeat vicious cycle of elections and loan waivers. So solution is to empower the farmers. From seed to market, give all facilities to the farmers,” he said. Farmers’ anger about low crop prices and their sense that the government has done far too little to address them contributed to the state election defeats. The government is now considering three options for a relief package to help farmers suffering because of low crop prices at a cost of as much as 3 trillion rupees ($43.20 billion), three government sources told Reuters last week. Former Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel had personally written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about wanting to resign, citing personal reasons, several months before stepping down from the office in December, Modi said. “The governor himself requested (to resign) because of personal reasons. I am revealing for the first time, he was telling me about this for the past 6-7 months before his resignation. He gave it even in writing. He wrote to me personally”. Patel resigned after a months-long tussle over policy with the government that raised concerns about the bank’s independence as the next general election nears. When asked if there was any political pressure on the governor to resign, Modi denied that was the case. “No such question arises. I acknowledge that Patel did a good job as RBI Governor.”",0
" The top U.S general in Afghanistan told NATO troops on Tuesday to prepare themselves to deal with “positive processes or negative consequences” as peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban to end a 17-year war gain momentum. General Scott Miller, who commands U.S. forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolution Support (RS) mission in Afghanistan reiterated the need for a political settlement to end the conflict. “Peace talks (are) out there, regional players pressing for peace, the Taliban talking about peace, the Afghan government is talking about peace,” Miller told dozens of NATO soldiers who had gathered at RS headquarters in Kabul for an exercise session. Dressed in gym gear, Miller participated in a 60-minute open-air morning workout of sprints, squats, burpees and push-ups. He did not comment on reports that the United States was considering pulling out almost half of the 14,000-strong force currently deployed in Afghanistan. A White House spokesman said last week that U.S. President Donald Trump had not issued orders to withdraw the troops. However, the administration has not denied the reports, which have also prompted fears of a fresh refugee crisis. “Are (the RS) able to adapt? Are we able to adjust? Are we able to be in the right place to support positive processes and negative consequences, that’s what I ask you guys to think about in 2019,” Miller said. With the help of its allies, the U.S. launched a military campaign in Afghanistan 17 years ago to topple the Taliban government following the September 2001 strikes on American cities. The longest American war effort has since killed nearly 140,000 people, including security forces, insurgents and civilians, and has cost Washington close to a trillion dollars. Officials from the warring sides have met at least three times to discuss the withdrawal of international forces and a ceasefire in 2019. However, fighting has not subsided even as diplomatic efforts intensify. “As long as the Taliban want to fight we are going to fight,” said Colonel David Butler, spokesman for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. He added that 2019 would bring a unique opportunity for peace in the country that has been at war on and off for almost 40 years, since U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas fought to repel Soviet Union forces in the late 1970s. “Think of this — 40 years of war has a possibility of coming to an end,” Butler said. In their 2018 annual report, the Taliban said they had successfully forced the U.S. to invite them to the negotiating table. “The Mujahideen defended valiantly...the invaders were forced to review their war strategy,” the hardline Islamic militant group said in a statement.

" Pope Francis, in his first message of the new year on Tuesday, bemoaned a lack of unity across the world, and warned against a soulless hunt for profit that benefits only a few. “How much dispersion and solitude there is all around us. The world is completely connected, yet seems increasingly disjointed,” the pope said in his traditional New Year’s Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica. In his homily he paid homage to motherhood, saying a world that looked to the future while forgetting “a mother’s gaze” was shortsighted. “It may well increase its profits, but it will no longer see others as children. It will make money, but not for everyone. We will all dwell in the same house, but not as brothers and sisters,” he said. The New Year’s address followed a turbulent 2018 for the pope, whose Church was battered by a torrent of sex scandals across the world that Francis has repeatedly failed to contain. The sense of crisis was underscored on Monday when the Vatican spokesman and his deputy abruptly and unexpectedly resigned following disagreements on communications strategy. Pope Francis made no overt reference to the tumult, but called for Roman Catholics to remain rooted to the Church, saying: “Unity counts more than diversity.” He also warned that Church risked becoming “a beautiful museum of the past” if people lost “the amazement of faith”.",0
" Former Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) Representative Director Greg Kelly has been released on bail after more than a month in detention on financial-misconduct charges, as a Tokyo court rejected prosecutors’ request to keep the American executive in custody. Kelly and Carlos Ghosn, the automaker’s ousted chairman, were detained upon arrival in Japan on Nov. 19 on suspicion of understating Ghosn’s income in financial statements for several years. The arrests jolted the global car industry and strained Nissan’s alliance with French car maker Renault SA (RENA.PA). Ghosn remains in custody. A crowd of Japanese and international reporters and camera crews had gathered since Tuesday morning waiting for Kelly’s release. He left the Tokyo Detention Centre with his lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, by taxi at around 10:45 p.m. (1345 GMT), a Reuters witness said. Kelly said in a statement that he had not falsified any documents and looked forward to restoring his honour in court, adding that he wanted to return to his family as soon as possible, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. There was no answer at Kitamura’s office when contacted by Reuters for comment. The ruling by the Tokyo District Court came after an appeal by Kelly’s family in Tennessee. He paid bail of 70 million yen (503,395 pounds) in cash, the court said. But he could be barred from leaving Japan or talking to people related to the case, NHK said earlier in the day, although exceptions can be made for overseas travel on a case-by-case basis. Kelly’s wife, Dee Kelly, appealed for his release in a video statement last week, saying her husband had been “wrongly accused as part of a power grab by several Nissan executives”, that he and Ghosn “fully believe that they did not break the law” and citing her husband’s need for surgery for spinal stenosis. A Nissan spokesman said the car maker was not in a position to comment on the latest twist in the more-than-month-long saga. “The company’s own investigation uncovered substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct, resulting in a unanimous board vote to dismiss Ghosn and Kelly as chairman and representative director. Our investigation is ongoing,” the spokesman said. Both Kelly and Ghosn remain on the Japanese car maker’s board but without representative rights. The court on Sunday extended Ghosn’s detention for 10 days, following fresh allegations of making Nissan shoulder personal investment losses. Ghosn was re-arrested on Friday based on suspicions that around October 2008 he shifted personal trades to Nissan to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also said Ghosn had inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account. Ghosn will remain in Tokyo’s main detention centre, where he has been confined since his arrest in November, at least until Jan. 1.",0
" Turkey and the United States have agreed to complete their agreement on the Syrian town of Manbij by the time the full U.S. withdrawal from Syria is completed, the state-owned Anadolu news agency cited the foreign minister as saying on Tuesday. Under the Manbij roadmap, Turkey and the United States agreed to a complete withdrawal of the Kurdish YPG militia from the town. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist organisation. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu will travel to Russia to discuss the process of withdrawal in the coming days, broadcaster CNN Turk said.",0
" Pope Francis led the world’s Roman Catholics into Christmas on Monday, urging people in the developed world to seek a simpler, less materialistic life and condemning the yawning gap between the rich and the poor. Francis, 82, marking the sixth Christmas of his papacy, led a solemn service for nearly 10,000 people in St. Peter’s Basilica for his traditional Christmas Eve Mass. Security has been tight around the Vatican and many other tourist areas in Rome for the Christmas season. Last week police in southern Italy arrested a Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb churches in Italy, including St. Peter’s. In his homily, Francis said the infant Jesus, born in poverty in a stable, should make everyone, particularly those who have become “greedy and voracious,” reflect on the real meaning of life. “... Let us ask ourselves: Do I really need all these material objects and complicated recipes for living? Can I manage without all these unnecessary extras and live a life of greater simplicity?” Francis said. “In our day, for many people, life’s meaning is found in possessing, in having an excess of material objects. An insatiable greed marks all human history, even today, when, paradoxically, a few dine luxuriantly while all too many go without the daily bread needed to survive,” he said. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, has made defending the poor a hallmark of his papacy. On Saturday, the Vatican said he had given the homeless in Rome a Christmas gift of a new clinic in St. Peter’s Square where they can get free medical help. The Catholic charity Caritas estimated late last year that there are more than 16,000 homeless in Rome and their number congregating near the Vatican has grown visibly in recent years, especially at night when they cluster under arcades to sleep. Monday night’s Christmas Eve papal Mass was the first held with a new, energy-saving lighting system for the largest church in Christendom. It employs 100,000 LEDs (light emitting diodes), using only 10 percent of the energy of the previous system. On Christmas Day on Tuesday, Francis will deliver his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica, the same balcony where he first appeared after his election on March 13, 2013.",0
" Thailand’s king will be officially crowned in elaborate ceremonies on May 4-6 as the latest ruler in the centuries-old monarchy, the royal palace said on Tuesday. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, has been serving since shortly after his father died in 2016 following a 70-year reign. “His Majesty deems it fit to hold the coronation ceremony per royal traditions for the good fortune of the nation and the kingdom, to be enjoyed by the hopeful people,” a palace statement said. In the three-day coronation, the king will be officially crowned on May 4 and a celebration procession will be held on May 5. The king will meet the public and foreign dignitaries on May 6, the palace said. Vajiralongkorn, also known by the title King Rama X, became Thailand’s constitutional monarch two years ago following the death of his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, on Oct. 13, 2016. His official coronation has been delayed until after a year-long mourning period for Bhumibol, who was cremated in October 2017 in a grand royal funeral in Bangkok. King Bhumibol was revered by Thais during his seven decades on the throne and the deep relationship between the monarchy and the military helped facilitate a smooth royal transition following his death. Since then, Vajiralongkorn has overseen sweeping changes to royal affairs, including the running of palace finances, which were formerly managed by the government. Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932, but the king remains supremely regarded as the spiritual protector of its people and culture. The kingdom is due to hold elections on Feb. 24, and the current election timeline means the coronation will likely take place before a new government is formed. The elections are meant to restore democracy after a 2014 military coup ousted an elected prime minister, though changes to the constitution in the interim ensure the military will retain a great deal of control.",0
" New York’s Times Square erupted with fireworks and cheers at the stroke of midnight on Tuesday as thousands of hardy merrymakers braved pouring rain and watched the glowing New Year’s Eve ball complete its midnight descent to mark the start of 2019. For the multitudes who gathered in the famed midtown Manhattan crossroads, the thrilling moment was reward for enduring hours of standing in a steady downpour during the waning hours of 2018. Helping to keep spirits high was a slate of performers including Christina Aguilera, New Kids on the Block and Sting who entertained the resilient crowd. Many donned plastic rain ponchos and sported colourful, oversized top hats handed out by organizers. “It was a bucket-list thing,” said Daniela Ramous, a 34-year-old sales manager from McAllen, Texas. “You grow up watching it on TV, you see all the excitement. There’s something magical about New York during this time of year.” Injecting a sombre note into the festivities, the Times Square Alliance, the business association that organises the event, paid a special tribute to freedom of the press, after a year in which journalists came under attack around the world, including in the United States. A minute before midnight, an invited group of journalists from ABC News, NBC News, the Washington Post, Reuters and other outlets joined Mayor Bill de Blasio in pushing the button that initiates the glittering ball’s drop. Visitors had begun gathering inside penned-off enclosures in the morning, starting an hours-long marathon of standing in one place, with no access to public restrooms. Belying the idea that New Yorkers themselves eschew the Times Square festivities, Eskie Garcia, a 59-year-old city worker living in Brooklyn, said she has come every year for about a decade. “You have to come here in person,” she said before applying lipstick and asking a stranger to take her picture on her cellphone. “Especially when you live by yourself. You come, you meet people.” Janette Masson, 29, said she preferred this year’s rain to last year’s bone-chilling cold. Masson, who works in retail in Boston, had been in her pen since 9.30 a.m., eating granola bars for lunch and dinner. “I can deal with it,” said Masson’s 61-year-old mother, Judy Masson, as she stood in the rain with many hours of waiting still to come. “You make the best of a bad thing.” Umbrellas were banned as part of the tight security plan, reflecting concern over the possibility of random attacks. Plastic ponchos were allowed, with street vendors selling them for $5 on nearby avenues. The Werline family from San Antonio, Texas, parlayed a connection with a friend who works at the Hard Rock Cafe into a coveted dry spot. Even though they did not have tickets for the private party inside, they had been permitted to stand under the attraction’s deep awning. “Thank God we know someone,” Tammy Werline, 49, said as rain cascaded off the awning’s edge and people in suits and cocktail dresses buzzed in and out of the restaurant, almost directly below the glowing ball. The tradition of watching a giant ball drop from a pole on top of the narrow building at the head of Times Square in midtown Manhattan began in 1907. The ball in current use - a glittering, LED-studded sphere made by Waterford Crystal and Philips Lighting - made its debut in 2008. Weighing 11,875 pounds (5,386 kg) and measuring 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter, it sits year-round on the roof of One Times Square, the one-time headquarters of the New York Times. As in years past, the New York Police Department screened people entering the corrals, deployed sharpshooters on rooftops and used radiation detectors throughout the event. It also had planned to use an aerial drone for the first time to monitor the crowds, but cancelled the effort on Monday evening given the wind and rain. The organizers chose to honour press freedom and the contribution of journalists partly because of the deadly hostility that some reporters have faced this year. Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist for the Washington Post and U.S. resident, was killed inside a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. In June, a gunman shot dead five employees of The Capital, a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland. This month also marked the first anniversary of the imprisonment in Myanmar of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo for investigating how the country’s security forces killed members of its Muslim Rohingya minority.",0

" China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday, ahead of a major speech about the island by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. China has heaped pressure on Tsai since she took office in 2016, cutting off dialogue, whittling down Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic allies and forcing foreign airlines to list Taiwan as part of China on their websites. China fears Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan’s formal independence, though Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills. Taiwan is gearing up for presidential elections in a year’s time. Tsai’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party suffered stinging losses to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November. In a new year’s address at the presidential office in Taipei, Tsai said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait needed a pragmatic understanding of the basic differences that exist between them in terms of values and political systems. “Here, I would like to call on China to face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan,” Tsai said, referring to the island’s formal name. China “must respect the insistence of 23 million people on freedom and democracy, and must use peaceful, on parity means to handle our differences”, she added. China’s interference in the island’s political and social development is “Taiwan’s biggest challenge at the moment”, Tsai said. China denies any interference in Taiwan’s internal affairs. China views Taiwan as a wayward province, to be brought under its control by force if needed, with no right to international recognition as a separate political entity. Democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China. Liu Jieyi, head of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said in his new year’s message they had not wavered last year in the face of “deliberate provocations” from Taiwan’s government. “Although the way ahead won’t all be plain sailing, we have the confidence and the ability to vanquish risks and challenges,” he said in a statement on the office’s website. On Wednesday, Xi will give a speech to mark 40 years since a key policy statement that eventually led to a thaw in relations with Taiwan, the “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan”. On Jan. 1, 1979, China declared an end to what had been routine artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled offshore islands close to China and offered to open up communications between the two sides, after decades of hostility. Chiang Kai-shek fled with defeated Nationalist forces to Taiwan in December 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists.Despite the deep business, cultural and personal links which exist today, no peace treaty or formal end to hostilities has been signed.",0
" Russian rescuers were on Monday searching for people still trapped under the rubble of a city apartment block that partly collapsed in a suspected gas blast, killing at least three, RIA said. Russia’s emergencies ministry told the news agency that four people had been recovered alive from the nine-storey building in Magnitogorsk, an industrial city some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow in the southern Urals. News agency TASS said 79 people were unaccounted for, quoting Chelyabinsk regional Deputy Governor Oleg Klimov. The emergencies ministry said the blast, probably caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments. RIA said it ripped through the building at around 0600 a.m. (0100 GMT) when many residents were asleep. Monday is a public holiday in Russia. There have been several similar incidents in Russia in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas usage. In 2015, at least five people were killed when a gas explosion damaged an apartment building in the southern Russian city of Volgograd.",0

" U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear arsenal, apologised for a Twitter message saying it was ready if necessary to drop something “much, much bigger” than the New Year’s Eve ball in New York and showing a clip of an aircraft releasing bombs. “#TimesSquare tradition rings in the #NewYear by dropping the big ball...if ever needed, we are #ready to drop something much, much bigger,” the tweet said, hours before the midnight descent of the illuminated ball in New York’s Times Square marking the arrival of the new year. The video showed a B-2 bomber dropping bombs, followed by explosions on the ground. The message touched off many critical comments on social media. Mary Fahner-Short, using the handle @maryfshort, wrote on Twitter: “Why is @US_Stratcom joking about nuclear war? #shameful.” Later on Monday, the message was deleted from the U.S. Strategic Command’s Twitter feed. A new message said: “Our previous NYE tweet was in poor taste & does not reflect our values. We apologise. We are dedicated to the security of America & allies.”",0
" The U.S. Navy has informed lawmakers of its intent to pursue a block purchase of two Ford-class aircraft carriers, Senator Tim Kaine’s office said on Monday, a step officials have said could save billions of dollars as the Trump administration tries to expand the size of the fleet. The decision comes nine months after the Navy expressed interest in a block buy and asked shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries for detailed pricing on the cost of two aircraft carriers as it considered doubling its order for the most expensive ship in the U.S. fleet in a bid to save money. The Navy commissioned the first Ford-class aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, in July 2017, three years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The Ford cost about $13 billion. The Navy has said it would spend about $43 billion (33.8 billion pounds) in total to build the first three ships in the Ford class. Huntington Ingalls Chief Executive Mike Petters has said multi-ship purchases are the best way to reduce costs. Kaine, of Virginia and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said a block buy would save billions and provide more stability to the Hampton Roads shipbuilding community in southeastern Virginia. “This smart move will save taxpayer dollars and help ensure the shipyards can maintain a skilled workforce to get the job done,” he said in a statement. The Navy released a force structure goal in 2016 that calls for a 355-ship fleet. Previously it had a goal of 308 ships, and the actual size of the Navy had generally been between 270 and 290 ships, according to the Congressional Research Service. A 355-ship fleet would include 12 aircraft carriers, one more than the previous goal. The United States currently operates 11 aircraft carriers, several times more than any other country.",0
" Indonesian military and rescue teams fanned out across a stretch of coastline on Monday, hoping to find survivors of a tsunami triggered by a landslide from a volcano that killed at least 373 people. Thick clouds of ash spewed from Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide late on Saturday set off waves that smashed into coastal areas on both sides of the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java. Rescuers used heavy machinery and bare hands to dig bodies out of mud and wreckage along a 100 km (60 mile) stretch of Java’s west coast. More than 1,400 people were injured, and about 12,000 residents had to move to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday. The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade. Earthquakes flattened parts of the island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on a remote part of Sulawesi island in September. “At least 373 people have died, while 128 people are currently missing,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said on Monday evening. (For graphic on Indonesia tsunami disaster zone, click tmsnrt.rs/2RdjsMd) Saturday’s tsunami destroyed more than 700 buildings, from small shops and houses to villas and hotels. It took just 24 minutes after the landslide for waves to hit land, and there was no early warning for those living on the coast. Vehicles were crushed by waves that lifted chunks of metal, felled trees, wooden beams and household items and deposited them on roads and rice fields. Nurjana, 20, ran uphill after the tsunami hit. Her beachside snack stall was washed away. “I opened the door straight away and saved myself. I jumped over the wall,” she said. “Everything is destroyed.” Out in the strait, Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was still erupting on Sunday night, belching white smoke and ash into the sky. The meteorology agency that an area of about 64 hectares, or 90 soccer pitches, of the volcanic island had collapsed into the sea. In 1883, the volcano then known as Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunami, and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927, and has been growing ever since. The high waves isolated hundreds of people on Sebesi island, about 12 km from the volcano. “We are completely paralyzed,” Syamsiar, a village secretary on the island, told Metro TV, calling for food and medicine. President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, told disaster agencies to install early warning systems, but experts said that, unlike with tsunami caused by earthquakes, little could have been done to alert people that waves were coming. “Tsunamis from volcanic flank collapse are generated right at the coast and often close to populations,” said Eddie Dempsey, lecturer in structural geology at Britain’s University of Hull. “The interval between the volcanic collapse and the arrival of the waves is minimal.” The timing of the disaster over the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Families streamed out of the area on Monday for fear of further tsunami, jamming roads already blocked by debris. Fishermen told how a light breeze was followed by a huge wave that smashed together wooden fishing boats moored off the coast and pulled down the trees they were tied to. Excavators were being used to move debris including piles of steel roofing tangled like spaghetti. Medics were sent in with the military, while groups of police and soldiers reached remote areas. One team used sniffer dogs to search for survivors at the beach club where a tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where the Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing at a party for about 200 guests. They had already pulled out nine bodies that day. At a village 20 km away, district chief Atmadja Suhara said he was helping to care for 4,000 refugees, many of them now homeless. “Everybody is still in a state of panic,” he said. “We often have disasters, but not as bad as this.” “God willing,” he said, “we will rebuild.” Additional reporting by Johan Purnomo and Adi Kurniawan in PANDEGLANG and Fanny Potkin, Tabita Diela and Wilda Asmarni in JAKARTA; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor and Martin Petty; Editing by Kevin Liffey All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" European shares fell on Monday as worries over a prolonged government shutdown and the position of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell added to angst about slowing economic growth, keeping stocks set for their biggest yearly loss in a decade Activity was thin, however, with many markets closed or trading for a half-day only before the Christmas holiday. Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE was down 0.5 percent, while France's CAC .FCHI and Spain's IBEX .IBEX eased 1.45 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Germany's DAX .GDAXI and Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB were shut. “Markets still under pressure from last week’s more hawkish Fed update, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus,” said Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets. European shares are down nearly 14 percent year-to-date and on track for their worst year since 2008, having fallen back to a two-year-low on last week's rate outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

" Turkey began reinforcing its positions on both sides of its border with Syria on Sunday, a Reuters witness said, as Ankara and Washington agreed to coordinate a U.S. withdrawal from Syria. The heightened military activity comes two days after President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would postpone a planned military operation on Kurdish YPG militia east of the Euphrates river in northern Syria following the U.S. decision to pull out. He also said Turkey would take over the fight against Islamic State militants. The Turkish presidency said Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call on Sunday agreed to establish military and diplomatic coordination to prevent an authority vacuum from developing as the United States withdraws. Earlier in the day, footage from broadcaster TRT World showed some Turkish convoys entering Syria via the Turkish border town of Karkamis, which is located some 35 km (22 miles) north of the northern Syrian town of Manbij. The convoys are crossing into an area controlled by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a Turkish ally, and are heading to the frontlines of Manbij, TRT World said. Manbij has been a major flashpoint between Ankara and Washington. In June, the NATO allies reached an agreement that would see the YPG ousted from the town but Turkey has complained the roadmap has been delayed and said Turkish forces would enter the town if the United States does not remove the Kurdish militants. The YPG has been a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State. Ankara says the militia is a terrorist organisation and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in Turkey since the 1980s. A Reuters witness saw hundreds of vehicles head to the southern border province of Kilis after leaving Hatay, another border province, around 0030 GMT on Sunday, as citizens sounded their horns to celebrate. The convoy included tanks, howitzers, machine guns and buses carrying commandos, the witness said. Part of the military equipment and personnel are to be positioned in posts along the border while some had crossed into Syria via the district of Elbeyli situated some 45 km (28 miles) northwest of Manbij, Demiroren News Agency (DHA) reported. Reuters could not independently verify the reason for the reinforcements and Turkish officials were not immediately available for comment. Turkey, with support from the FSA, carried out two cross-border operations in northern Syria, dubbed “Euphrates Shield” and “Olive Branch”, against the YPG and Islamic State. The military offensives were focused on areas to the west of the Euphrates and Turkey has not gone east of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces. The operations carved out de facto buffer zones, which are currently under the control of Turkey and the FSA.",0
" Russia’s FSB state security service said on Monday it has detained an American citizen suspected of spying in Moscow and has opened a criminal case against him. The FSB said the American had been detained on Friday, but it gave no details of the nature of his alleged espionage activities. Under Russian law, espionage can carry between 10 and 20 years in prison. A U.S. State Department representative said Russia had notified it that a U.S. citizen had been detained and it expected Moscow to provide consular access to see him. “We have requested this access and expect Russian authorities to provide it,” the representative said, without providing details of the identity of the American or the reasons behind his detention. The English-language service of TASS news agency named him as Paul Whelan. David Whelan said in an email that he was Paul Whelan’s brother and said that his brother had been arrested. He declined to comment on how he learnt of his brother’s detention, his work status at the time of his arrest and whether his brother lived in Novi, Michigan, as address records indicate. There was online speculation that Paul Whelan had worked for global staffing firm Kelly Services, which is headquartered about a 40 minute-drive from Novi in Troy, Michigan. A spokeswoman for Kelly said a Paul Whelan had worked for the company until February 2016. “Kelly has yet to confirm whether this former employee is the same individual reported upon in the news stories,” said Kelly spokeswoman Heather Klee. Russia’s relations with the United States plummeted when Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and Washington and Western allies have imposed a broad range of sanctions on Russian officials, companies and banks. Earlier this month, Russian national Maria Butina pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to a conspiracy charge in a deal with prosecutors, and admitted to working with a top Russian official to infiltrate American conservative activist groups and politicians as an agent for Moscow.",0
" U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal firebrand who has taken on Wall Street and traded barbs with Donald Trump, on Monday became the most prominent Democrat to announce a challenge to the Republican president in 2020. Warren said she had formed an exploratory committee, which will allow her to begin raising money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic primary field before the November 2020 presidential election. She said on Twitter she would announce her decision on whether to run early in 2019. Warren, 69, a senator from Massachusetts since 2013, became one of Trump’s fiercest critics during the 2016 presidential race and they have continued to exchange biting insults during his presidency. Trump mockingly refers to her as “Pocahontas” because of her claim to Native American ancestry. Warren has denounced Trump as an “insecure money grubber” with a platform of “racism, sexism and xenophobia,” while Trump has described the former Harvard Law School professor as “goofy” and a “lowlife” with “a nasty mouth.” On Monday, Warren released a video in which she outlined her vision of a path to opportunity for all Americans and charged that the U.S. middle class was under attack from corporate interests. She later elaborated on the theme in an exchange with reporters outside her Cambridge, Massachusetts, home. “America’s middle class is getting hollowed out and opportunity for too many of our young people is shrinking,” she said. “So I’m in this fight all the way. Right now Washington works great for the wealthy and the well connected. It’s just not working for anyone else.” Trump, in a phone interview with Fox News, said he would love to run against Warren and again ridiculed her assertion of Native American ancestry. Asked if he thought Warren really believed she could defeat him, Trump said: “I don’t know, you’d have to ask her psychiatrist.” The Democratic presidential field could eventually include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden. Julian Castro, former President Barack Obama’s housing secretary, formed an exploratory committee this month. Warren welcomed the “strong and growing group of Democrats” making arguments similar to those she is making, saying: “That’s how we build a movement. We do it together.” In searching for a candidate to run against Trump, Democrats will grapple with the tension between the party’s establishment and liberal progressive wings that flared during the 2016 nominating primaries between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran under the Democratic banner. A Warren candidacy can expect opposition from Wall Street. In the U.S. Senate, she has been a strong voice on financial issues and a self-described defender of the ordinary American against powerful interests. Following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Warren emerged as a leading critic of Wall Street and continues to advocate for stiffer regulation and oversight, including reinstating a rule that would separate banks’ retail business from their riskier investment banking activities. Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has fought the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken post-crisis financial rules, going as far as to attack moderate Democrats who backed a May rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law. In a September interview marking 10 years since the financial crisis, Warren was asked about breaking up big banks. “Oh yeah,” she told the New York Times. “Give me a chance.” She also has opposed the administration’s efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, and has pressured the Federal Reserve to take a tough line on scandal-hit lender Wells Fargo & Co . Many of Warren’s policy positions have focussed on economic inequality. She recently offered legislation calling on the U.S. government to manufacture generic drugs to reduce their cost. In 2017, she joined other senators in a proposal to extend the federal Medicare health insurance programme for seniors to include everyone. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel dismissed her as “another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.” Warren’s 80 percent name recognition does not translate into actual support, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato said. “Some Democrats swear by her and love her blunt style, while others are put off by her and fear she’d lose to Trump,” he said. “Warren has a lot of convincing to do,” adding the same is true of many other Democratic contenders. Warren will begin campaigning soon in some of the states with early presidential nominating contests, a person familiar with her plans said. Trump’s use of Pocahontas, a 17th century Native American woman associated with the British colony in Jamestown, Virginia, was aimed at drawing attention to a controversy over her heritage raised during Warren’s 2012 Senate race. Warren in October released a DNA analysis she said supported her assertion that she had Native American lineage. Trump’s reference has drawn criticism from some Native American groups, while others criticized Warren for trying to lay claim to a tribal heritage.",0
" A departure hall at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport was briefly cleared on Monday after a man claimed to have a bomb, national police said in a statement. No explosives were found at the airport, the police said, adding that the arrested person held for questioning is a 51-year-old Canadian man. The statement did not further identify the suspect. Police said the man had been arrested and departure hall 3 had been cleared as a “precautionary measure”. The airport said departure hall 3 was open again for operation.",0
" Defence Secretary Jim Mattis gave his farewell message to the U.S. armed forces on Monday, telling them to “keep the faith in our country” and stand firm alongside allies after he resigned over policy differences with President Donald Trump. Mattis, who had been seen as a stabilizing factor in U.S. defence policy, is due to transfer authority near midnight to his deputy, Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing Co executive. Mattis, a retired Marine general who has often shied from the spotlight, did not have any sort of departure ceremony when he left the Pentagon, leaving his farewell memo as his final public remarks as defence secretary. Historically, departing secretaries have had a major ceremony. In his brief message, Mattis acknowledged the political turbulence in Washington but called on the U.S. military to stay firm in its mission “to support and defend the Constitution while protecting our way of life.” “Our department is proven to be at its best when the times are most difficult. So keep the faith in our country and hold fast, alongside our allies, aligned against our foes,” Mattis said. Last week Trump said he was replacing Mattis two months earlier than had been expected, a move officials said was driven by Trump’s anger at Mattis’ resignation letter and its rebuke of the president’s foreign policy. Mattis had abruptly quit after falling out with Trump, including over surprise decisions to withdraw all troops from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan. Mattis’ resignation letter laid bare the growing divide between them, and implicitly criticized the president for failing to value America’s closest allies, who fought alongside the United States in both conflicts. Shanahan, best known for his focus on internal Pentagon reform and his private-sector experience, will take over as acting defence secretary on Tuesday. Trump has suggested Shanahan could stay in the role as acting secretary for a considerable amount of time. Shanahan has served as the deputy secretary of defence since July 2017. Before joining the Pentagon last year, he spent three decades at Boeing and was the general manager for the 787 Dreamliner passenger jet. Shanahan is not expected to break from major Pentagon policies, including a new focus on the military threats from China and Russia, which were outlined in the U.S. National Defence Strategy. ""Mr. Shanahan was instrumental in crafting the National Defence Strategy. His ideas, priorities and philosophy are in that document,"" his spokesman, Army Lieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino, said.

" Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday rejected opposition complaints of vote rigging and said people had gone to the polls enthusiastically in a general election that her ruling alliance swept with a landslide. The victory consolidates Hasina’s decade-long rule in the South Asian nation, in which her government has overseen booming economic growth, but is accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent - charges her government denies. In a victory speech at her official residence in the capital Dhaka, Hasina, 71, touted robust support for her Awami League-led alliance, which won 287 of the 298 seats, while the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led alliance got six seats. “They voted so enthusiastically,” Hasina told a room full of journalists and foreign election observers. “What do people want? They want to fulfil their basic needs. When they feel that yes, only this government can ensure it, then definitely they will vote for us.” The opposition rejected the result and called for a fresh vote, complaining of what it said was widespread rigging. Neighbours India and China congratulated Hasina, and a visiting election monitoring group from South Asian countries said they had found nothing amiss in voting in the capital Dhaka. There was no immediate statement from the European Union or the United States, which had expressed concern last week over campaign violence it said had mostly impacted opposition candidates, and a delay in visas for many U.S.-funded observers who couldn’t make it into the country. At least 17 people were killed during Sunday’s poll that followed a violent election campaign in which both sides blamed the other for casualties. Candidates reported witnessing ballot-stuffing and vote-rigging by ruling party activists, who also barred opposition polling agents from voting centres, said opposition leader Kamal Hossain. “We’ve had bad elections in the past but I must say that it is unprecedented how bad this particular election was,” Hossain said. Bangladesh’s Election Commission said it was investigating allegations of vote rigging but rejected demands for another vote. Human Rights Watch expressed concern over the election’s credibility and Amnesty International called for an impartial probe into “deeply disturbing” election violence. “ONE-PARTY STATE” The opposition BNP alleged it was never granted a level playing field to campaign in the election, with thousands of its workers locked up on charges it termed as fictitious, and many candidates attacked by ruling party activists, crippling its campaign. The BNP had boycotted the last polls in 2014, not trusting Hasina to hold them fairly, and some BNP leaders said Sunday’s vote had proved them right. The BNP went to the vote for the first time without its leader Khaleda Zia – Hasina’s arch rival and a former prime minister – who was jailed in February on corruption charges she says were politically motivated. The rivalry between the two women has largely defined Bangladeshi politics for decades. Hasina on Sunday referred to the BNP as “terrorists”, saying the election had been “very peaceful” barring a few incidents in which workers for her party were killed. She said the Election Commission was independent and would investigate any allegations of rigging. Hasina, the longest-serving leader in the history of the Muslim-majority country of 165 million people, promised more development and an improved economy in her third straight term. Her adviser H.T. Imam said the government would consider raising the minimum wage for workers in its garment industry, which generates about 83 percent of exports and is the world’s second-largest only after China’s. “Certainly, the Awami League enjoys strong constituencies and has support and it can get votes, but for any party to win more than 90 percent of the seats is simply too suspicious,” said Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at the Washington-based Wilson Centre think-tank. “I fear that this election result signifies that Bangladesh has really become something very closely approximating a one-party state.”",0
" France’s embattled president, Emmanuel Macron, vowed on Monday to press on with his reform agenda in 2019 despite a spate of “yellow vest” protests that have challenged his government and extended a plunge in his approval ratings. Promised overhauls of France’s unemployment benefits, civil service and public pensions will be undertaken in the coming year, Macron said in his televised New Year message. Confounding some expectations of a more contrite message, Macron struck an unapologetic note as he urged voters to face up to economic realities underpinning recently enacted reforms of French labour rules, and others yet to come. “In recent years, we’ve engaged in a blatant denial of reality,” Macron said in the address, delivered - unusually - from a standing position in his Elysee Palace office. “We can’t work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending.” In a veiled attack on the far-left and hard-right groupings active on the fringes of the often violent protests, Macron also decried self-appointed “spokespeople for a hateful mob” who he said had targeted foreigners, Jews, gays and the press. Almost 20 months after he became France’s youngest president, Macron’s popularity is at the lowest level recorded in modern French history. It stood at just 24 percent in late December compared to 47 percent a year earlier, according to a Journal du Dimanche aggregate of polls, as he struggled to draw a line under numerous setbacks. The current wave of demonstrations, which have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities, has yet to abate despite fiscal giveaways and a increase in the wage for the poorest workers. Protesters were expected to join the New Year crowds thronging Paris’s Champs-Elysees Avenue overnight, amid a heavy police presence. A scandal over Macron’s former bodyguard Alexandre Benalla, who was eventually fired after video emerged of him beating protesters, has resurfaced with the revelation that he continued to travel on diplomatic passports and exchange messages with Macron long after his dismissal. Macron said efforts to bolster international controls on immigration and tax evasion would be at the heart of European Union proposals he plans to announce in “coming weeks” - to be pursued in parallel with a domestic agenda reconciling ambitious reform with France’s commitment to social solidarity. “This is the line I have followed since the first day of my mandate, and which I plan to keep following,” he said. “This coming year, 2019, is in my view a decisive one.”",0
" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he would not resign from office should the attorney general accept police recommendations to indict him before his side of the case is heard. Netanyahu last week announced a snap election would be held in April, seeking a fresh political mandate that could help him weather possible charges in corruption investigations. The Israeli leader is enmeshed in three graft cases and denies any wrongdoing. Should Israel’s attorney-general decide to press charges against Netanyahu, he would announce the indictment pending a hearing, after which charges could be filed in court. Asked at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro whether he would bow out of the election race should that happen, Netanyahu said: “I don’t intend to resign.” “According to the law, the prime minister does not have to resign during the hearing process ... The hearing doesn’t end until my side is heard,” he said. “Imagine what would happen if a prime minister is ousted before the hearing is finished, and then after the hearing they decide to close the case. It’s absurd. It’s a terrible blow to democracy.” The indictment decision had been expected within weeks, but some analysts say the attorney general could opt to delay the move out of concern he might influence the outcome of the election. The Justice Ministry has promised to continue its work “independent of political events”. Opinion polls show Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party easily winning the April 9 vote, which was originally scheduled for November. Netanyahu held the news conference during a trip to Brazil for the inauguration of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday. He is the first Israeli prime minister to visit Brazil.",0
" Mozambique’s former finance minister, Manuel Chang, has been arrested in South Africa at the request of the United States, a police spokesman said on Monday. Chang, who was in charge of Mozambique’s finances when it guaranteed $2 billion in secret borrowing by state-owned firms in 2013 and 2014, was arrested on Saturday in Johannesburg. “He is wanted by the U.S.,” police spokesman Vish Naidoo said. Mozambique’s state news agency said Chang, 63, was wanted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and money laundering. It said the charges had nothing to do with the undisclosed borrowing, which prompted foreign donors including the International Monetary Fund to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and debt default. Two years on from the disclosure of the loans, Mozambique is still battling to reduce a suffocating debt burden and restructure some of the debt.",0
" Iran could use its growing clout in Iraq to turn it into a springboard for attacks against Israel, the chief of Israeli military intelligence said on Monday. Israel sees the spread of Tehran’s influence in the region as a growing threat, and has carried out scores of air strikes in civil war-torn Syria against suspected military deployments and arms deliveries by Iranian forces supporting Damascus. Iraq, which does not share a border with Israel, is technically its enemy but was last an open threat in the 1991 Gulf War. Since a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim, Israel has worried that Iraq’s Shi’ite majority could tilt towards Iran. “Iraq is under growing influence of the (covert Iranian foreign operations unit) Qods Force and Iran,” military intelligence chief Major-General Tamir Hayman told a conference in Tel Aviv. With U.S. President Donald Trump disengaging from the region, Hayman said, the Iranians may “see Iraq as a convenient theatre for entrenchment, similar to what they did in Syria, and to use it as a platform for a force build-up that could also threaten the State of Israel”. Iraq’s prime minister said on Sunday that security officials from Baghdad had met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus, and hinted at a bigger Iraqi role fighting Islamic State militants as U.S. troops withdraw. Citing Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources, Reuters reported in August that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Shi’ite allies in Iraq. Baghdad denied the findings. The following week, Israel said it might attack such sites in Iraq, effectively expanding a campaign now focussed on Syria. Hayman predicted 2019 would bring “significant change” to Syria, where Assad has beaten back rebels with the help of Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements, and where Trump this month ordered a pullout of U.S. troops. “This presence of Iran, with Syria’s return to stabilisation under a Russian umbrella, is something we are watching closely,” he said. Israel has also been monitoring Iranian conduct since Trump quit the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran in May and reimposed U.S. sanctions. The deal placed caps on nuclear projects with bomb-making potential, though Iran denied having such designs. Trump, with Israeli support, deemed the caps insufficient. “We assess that Iran will strive to stay within the deal but will do everything in order to find ways of circumventing the American sanctions,” Hayman said.

" Indonesian fisherman Yadi was at his seaside home on the west coast of Java island when he felt a light breeze picking up on Saturday night as hundreds of people milled about in nearby restaurants, enjoying barbecued fish. Then a surge of seawater swept up the beach, scattering the crowds, flattening buildings, and sending parked cars crunching into trees. At least 281 people were killed in tsunami waves of up to three metres (10 feet) that hit several towns along the rim of the Sunda Strait, between Java and Sumatra islands, triggered by a landslide on the Anak Krakatau volcano. It is the latest in a string of natural disasters to strike Indonesia in 2018, making it the deadliest year in more than a decade. “People said ‘run, run a wave is coming!’. There were three waves in a row,” said Yadi, a middle-aged fisherman who operates a fleet of six vessels that were among dozens that sank or were dragged out to sea by the waves. “There was a real panic. Many people were left behind,” he said, adding that he and his family escaped by running to higher ground. What’s left behind is a wasteland of collapsed houses and hotels and muddy roads strewn with twisted metal and wood. Thousands of displaced and grieving residents were searching for missing loved ones on Monday and trying to salvage whatever they could of their belongings. Heavy equipment was being used to help with the rescue effort. Medics were sent in with the military, while groups of police and soldiers searched remote areas. Cici Paramita, 27, was clambering through the shattered remains of her house, a tangle of water-logged debris, 50 metres from the beach. “We lost all our belongings,” she said. On Saturday night, she said she had to wade through waist-deep water to rescue her eight-year-old son who was trapped in debris.

" Asian stocks were subdued on Monday as investors fretted that political instability in the United States was leaving the country rudderless at a time when the global economy was showing signs of faltering. Moves were limited by a holiday in Japan while many bourses are set to close early for Christmas. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.5 percent to its lowest in seven weeks. Yet Chinese blue chips managed to edge up 0.2 percent, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 recouped early losses to rise 0.4 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue into January, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives. Trump on Sunday said he was replacing Defence Secretary Jim Mattis two months early, a move officials said was driven by the president’s anger at Mattis’ resignation letter and its rebuke of his foreign policy. Sources also told Reuters Trump has privately discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a move that would likely roil financial markets. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin felt it necessary to personally call the heads of the six largest U.S. banks to calm nerves and made plans to convene a group of officials known as the “Plunge Protection Team.” “It provides more than enough fodder for perceptions of chaos and instability in the White House,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “At the same time, the government shutdown offers a true foretaste of what lies ahead once the new Congress in sworn in on January 3.” The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, punishing equities to the benefit of bonds. The Nasdaq has fallen nearly 22 percent from its Aug. 29 high and into bear territory, while the S&P 500 was on track for its worst December since the Great Depression. At the same time 10-year Treasury yields were near their lowest since August at 2.79 percent, having fallen over 40 basis points in just six weeks. The gap between two- and 10-year yields has shrunk to only 14 basis points, a flattening of the curve that has sometimes heralded economic turning points in the past. “Many of the financial and economic indicators that turn first around business cycle peaks are now flashing red in advanced economies,” warned Simon MacAdam, global economist as Capital Economics. “This is consistent with our view that the recent loss of momentum in the world economy will develop into a more severe slowdown in 2019.” The flight to safe havens was again boosting the Japanese yen, with the dollar near a three-month trough at 111.02 yen on Monday. It fared better on the euro, which was undermined by a run of poor data out of Europe. The single currency hovered at $1.1376, after being as high as $1.1485 last week. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was a shade softer at 96.835. In commodity markets, gold held near its recent six-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher U.S. interest rates waned. Spot gold stood at $1,261.05 per ounce. Oil prices were near their lowest since the third quarter of 2017, having shed no less than 11 percent last week.

" A tsunami killed at least 222 people and injured hundreds on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra following an underwater landslide believed to have been caused by the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano, officials said. Indonesia sits on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years: - 2004: A massive 9.1 magnitude quake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh. - 2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April. Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra. - 2006: A shallow quake rocked the area around ancient royal city of Yogyakarta in Java killing at least 5,500 and destroying or damaging 150,000 homes. - 2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people. - 2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province. More than 1,100 people were killed. - 2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people. - 2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami. No tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings. - 2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island. - 2018: More than 2,000 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, on the west coast of Sulawesi island.

" Israel protested to Jordan on Sunday after the spokeswoman for the government in Amman was photographed stepping on the Israeli flag during a meeting with trade unionists. Jumana Ghunaimat, Jordan’s minister for media affairs and communications and the government spokeswoman, on Thursday walked over an Israeli flag painted on the floor of the headquarters of Jordan’s professional unions in Amman. She was on her way to attend a meeting between Jordanian Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz and union representatives. Razzaz, however, entered the building through a rear door, avoiding having to walk over the flag. Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday deploring the flag “desecration”, and said it had summoned acting Jordanian ambassador Mohammed Hmaid for a reprimand and that the Israeli embassy in Amman had also issued a “sharp protest”. The flag was painted on the floor of the building several years ago to encourage passers by to tread on it, a mark of disrespect, unions said at the time. Despite the neighbours’ 1994 peace deal and commercial and security ties, many Jordanians resent Israel and identify with the Palestinian struggle against it. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Qatarneh confirmed in a statement issued via state media that the Israeli embassy in Amman had asked for clarifications over the incident and that Israel had called in the Jordanian charge d’affaires in Tel Aviv to “discuss” the matter. Qatarneh said that Jordan respects its peace treaty with Israel and that Ghunaimat had entered a private building by its main entrance to attend an official meeting. The flag had been painted at a time when the unions were controlled by Jordan’s mainly Islamist opposition, fierce ideological foes of Israel. They have since lost influence and Jordan’s professional unions are mostly now run by nationalist and secular parties that avoid party activism. Still, some union members were unhappy that union leaders had allowed Razzaz to avoid the flag. “The unions took a cowardly stance by allowing the prime minister to enter from a back door and his aides no doubt told him of the presence of the flag at the entrance,” Masira Malaas, a leading union activist, said.

" A Turkish pro-government television channel has broadcast video showing men carrying suitcases purportedly containing the remains of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi into the residence of his country’s consul general in Istanbul. The footage broadcast by A Haber shows men carrying what it says were a total of five cases through the main entrance of the residence, a short distance from the consulate where Khashoggi, a leading critic of Saudi policies, was killed in early October. A Turkish official said the media report, also carried by the pro-government Sabah newspaper on its website, appeared to be accurate, without giving further details. There was no immediate reply from Saudi authorities to a Reuters request for comment on the footage. Khashoggi was a royal insider who became a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his death. The murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of 33-year-old prince, the kingdom’s de facto leader. Sabah said the cases had been brought to the residence in a black minibus at 3:09 pm (1209 GMT). After offering numerous contradictory explanations regarding the fate of Khashoggi, Riyadh later said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. Khashoggi’s remains have not been found and Turkey has repeatedly asked Saudi Arabia where they are. Last month, Turkish police searched a remote villa in a coastal area southeast of Istanbul as part of the investigation. Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor’s office said last month it is seeking the death penalty for five individuals, and that 11 of 21 suspects have been indicted and will be referred to court in Saudi Arabia. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week Ankara was working with other countries to take the investigation into Khashoggi’s killing to the United Nations.",0
" Britain is recalling two patrol boats from overseas deployments to help deal with an increase in the number of migrants trying to reach the country from France, interior minister Sajid Javid said on Monday. Javid said there had been an increase in the number of migrants crossing the English Channel from France and last week he declared the situation a “major incident”. On Monday, following a meeting of officials in London, he said two the additional ships would join three other vessels already working in the channel. He said 230 migrants had attempted to cross one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes in December, although almost half were prevented from leaving France. The number is a tiny fraction of those regularly attempting to reach European Union territory by crossing the Mediterranean from northern Africa and Turkey, many of whom are fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. But, their attempts to cross into Britain have attracted extensive domestic scrutiny amid a febrile political atmosphere less than three months before Britain leaves the European Union after a referendum in which immigration was a major theme. “This will help both with the human side of this situation but also to better protect our borders,” Javid said of the deployment. The last three months accounted for around 80 percent of all attempts in 2018, Javid said, adding crossings were up in 2018 compared to 2017. The interior ministry said the majority of those who had arrived in Britain in the recent period were Iranian but said it did not routinely publish data and would not be providing a running tally or exact comparisons with previous years. Local media reported that 12 people arrived at a beach in southeast England by small boat on Monday. Javid cut short a holiday to oversee the response to the situation and is seen as one of those jostling to replace Prime Minister Theresa May after she said earlier this month she would step down before the next scheduled nation election in 2022. Concern over both legal migration and illegal immigration was seen as an important driver of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union. “I don’t want people to think that if they leave a safe country like France, that they can get to Britain and just get to stay,” Javid said, outlining a desire to work with France to return as many of the migrants as possible.",0
" Mexico’s new leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday decreed tax cuts for northern states that he says will help power economic growth and deter migration to the United States. An executive order in the government’s official gazette granted lower rates for both value-added and income taxes in more than 40 municipalities bordering the United States, an area that has become a flashpoint over U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies to deter immigrants, including building a wall. Lopez Obrador’s tax cuts could reduce government tax income during 2019, when he will implement a budget that seeks to use spending cuts to help fund new social welfare and infrastructure projects. At an event in Monterrey in the northern state of Nuevo Leon on Saturday, Lopez Obrador said the minimum wage in the northern strip of municipalities would rise to 177 pesos ($9.00), nearly double the national level, starting Jan. 1, and that fuel prices would be set on a par with U.S. prices. “This is a very important project to boost investment and job creation,” Lopez Obrador told business leaders. The decree seeks to give an edge to northern Mexican businesses, which compete with U.S.-based companies across the border. Lopez Obrador has vowed to increase economic development to deter migration to the United States. Trump wants to make Mexico take in Central Americans who are seeking U.S. asylum. The plan will give businesses in the region a tax credits worth 50 percent of VAT dues. Companies that can show they earn more than 90 percent of their revenue in the area are eligible for an income tax credit worth one-third of dues. Last month, Citigroup economists estimated lower tax revenue from the north could cost the government around 120 billion pesos ($6.10 billion) a year. A national chamber of business owners, Coparmex, welcomed the decree in a statement as a “judicious” measure that could spur investment in the region. The center-right National Action Party, the biggest opposition to Lopez Obrador’s leftist coalition in Congress, said the decree was a “scam” since it fell short of a campaign promise to cut tax rates for consumers. PAN leader Marko Cortes said in a statement the VAT tax cuts would only benefit “intermediaries,” and that it would fail to boost investment since it was a presidential decree that could be removed at any moment.",0
" Bahrain’s high court upheld on Monday a five-year jail sentence against human rights activist Nabeel Rajab, his lawyer said, in a move described by campaign groups as “political persecution” and “utterly outrageous”. An outspoken critic of the Bahraini government who played a prominent role in pro-democracy protests in 2011, Rajab was convicted in February over social media posts in which he accused the prison authorities of torture and criticised Saudi Arabia’s air strikes in Yemen. Rajab, in his mid-50s, is already serving a two-year term for torture allegations he made in a news interview and faces a number of other cases, including over a column he wrote in the New York Times in 2016. “The Court of Cassation rejected the appeal and upheld the sentence of five years in prison against Nabeel Rajab for his tweets,” his lawyer, Mohamed Al Jishi, told Reuters by telephone. Bahrain’s government communication office said in a statement to Reuters that Rajab was afforded his full legal rights, including the right to appeal and continued access to legal counsel. “The Kingdom is fully committed to an inclusive pluralistic society, however, as in all countries, criminal offences cannot be allowed to go unchecked,” it added. Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim royal family rules over a Shi’ite majority, clamped down on dissent after pro-democracy protests in 2011, led mainly by Shi’ites, were quashed with the help of Gulf Arab neighbours. Home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, the small Gulf island prosecuted hundreds of protesters in mass trials and banned the main opposition groups. Most of the leading Shi’ite opposition figures and human rights activists are imprisoned or fled abroad. In July United Nations human rights experts called on Bahrain to release detained activists, including Rajab, and said the authorities had since last year undertaken “a fresh assault against freedom of expression, against civil society that is critical, and a marginalisation of political opposition parties.” Rajab lost an earlier appeal against the five-year sentence in June. A court filing by his lawyers showed he had been found guilty on charges of “spreading false news and rumours in time of war”, “insulting foreign countries” and “insulting publicly the interior ministry”. International rights groups have been following the case and the United States expressed concern. Lynn Maalouf Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director said Rajab is a prisoner of conscience. “It is utterly outrageous that he has already spent two years behind bars – including nine agonizing months in solitary confinement, amounting to torture,” she said in a statement released after the decision. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy with the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), said the verdict was a “political persecution.” Alwadaei accused the authorities of timing of the verdict during the global holiday season to avoid drawing attention to the case.

" The Vatican spokesman and his deputy resigned on Monday over disagreements on strategy, ending a year of upheaval in the Holy See’s communications structure. A brief Vatican statement gave no reason for the resignations. Spokesman Greg Burke, an American, tweeted that he and his Spanish deputy, Paloma Garcia Ovejero, had quit to let Pope Francis appoint a new team in what was a “time of transition”. A Vatican source said both Burke and Ovejero had wanted more autonomy from the Vatican department that oversees all communications, known as the Dicastery for Communications. They quit two weeks after Pope Francis appointed a personal friend, Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli, to become editorial director of all Vatican communications. The source said it was believed to be the first time both posts had changed hands simultaneously, underscoring the differences of opinion. “Paloma and I have resigned, effective Jan. 1. At this time of transition in Vatican communications, we think it’s best the Holy Father is completely free to assemble a new team,” Burke tweeted. The 59-year-old former Rome-based reporter for Fox News joined the Vatican in 2012 as an advisor in its Secretariat of State and become spokesman in 2016. He is a member of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei. Ovejero, 43, a former reporter for the Spanish radio network COPE, was one of the few high-ranking women in the Vatican. During Burke and Ovejero’s tenure, the top two jobs in the Vatican press room were, unusually, held by non-Italians. Tornielli is now the third-ranking person in the communications department but his closeness to the pope, whom he has known since before the pontiff’s election in 2013, will likely make him particularly influential. Monday’s resignations capped a year of tensions in Vatican communications. Monsignor Dario Vigano resigned as overall head in March after a scandal over a doctored letter, a public relations fiasco two months after the pope warned of the dangers of fake news. Vigano released part of a letter by former Pope Benedict that was to have remained private, using it to promote a book on the theology of Pope Francis. A promotional photo for the book released by Vigano blurred a part of the letter in which Benedict declined to write an introduction, saying he was unhappy with one of its contributors. Vigano was replaced in July by Paolo Ruffini, ex-head of a Catholic television station. The Vatican said Alessandro Gisotti, an Italian journalist who has handled the Vatican’s social media, would be interim spokesman.",0
" Democratic Republic of Congo’s opposition said on Monday it expected one of its candidates to win the presidential election based on early vote tallies, but the ruling coalition said it was confident its candidate had won the chaotic contest. The competing claims followed a disorderly election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems. After unofficial tallies started to circulate on social media on Monday, mobile internet connections in the capital Kinshasa and other cities slowed down or cut out entirely, residents said, in a possible move by authorities to stop the information from circulating. Government officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Authorities have cut the internet in the past, saying they sought to stop rumours from spreading during protests. The vote is meant to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila after 18 years in power and could lead to the vast central African country’s first ever democratic transition. But the opposition says the election was marred by fraud and accused Kabila of planning to rule from the sidelines through his preferred candidate. The government has said the election was fair. Any disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed the 2006 and 2011 elections and a wider security breakdown, particularly along Congo’s borders with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, where dozens of armed militia are active. Pierre Lumbi, the campaign manager to opposition candidate Martin Fayulu, said in a statement posted on Twitter that Fayulu was winning after more than a third of votes had been counted. “The polls are clear: they put...Martin Fayulu easily in the lead,” he said. Vital Kamerhe, the campaign manager to another opposition candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, said earlier that initial counting showed Tshisekedi and Fayulu neck-and-neck in the lead, both with more than 40 percent of the vote. He said the ruling coalition candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, who is backed by Kabila, had only about 13 percent, although a significant part of the vote remained to be tabulated. Shadary’s campaign said he will win. “For us, victory is certain,” Nehemie Mwilanya, Kabila’s chief of staff and a member of Shadary’s campaign, told a news conference on Monday morning, without providing figures. Shadary’s campaign said it has collected about 30 percent of the results but will not release any results before the national election commission (CENI). The election is a first-past-the-post system with no run-off. The first partial results are expected from CENI on Tuesday. Opposition officials complained of widespread irregularities, including several instances of what they said was outright fraud in Shadary’s favour. According to a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, nearly half of polling places opened late, 30 percent encountered problems due to malfunctioning voting machines or absent voter rolls and 10-15 percent were located in prohibited zones including police posts and private residences. The most recent opinion poll before the election, released by New York University’s Congo Research Group on Friday, showed Fayulu, a former Exxon Mobil manager, leading the race on 47 percent. Tshisekedi had 24 percent and Shadary 19 percent. Election day was mostly peaceful despite several violent incidents, including an altercation at a polling place in eastern Congo in which at least three people were killed. But the Catholic bishops conference (CENCO), which deployed thousands of vote monitors, said that many polling places opened late and were located in prohibited areas. CENI president Corneille Nangaa, however, said the vote had gone smoothly, aside from some minor difficulties, and the CENI rejected charges of fraud. More than 1.2 million Congolese in three opposition bastions were unable to vote at all after the CENI cancelled the polls there last week, citing an Ebola outbreak and ethnic violence. However, in the Ebola hotspot of Beni, an opposition stronghold, residents staged a mock presidential election to show the authorities a decision to postpone the vote there due to health fears was unfounded.

" Emmanuel Macron’s former security advisor said he had been in regular touch with the president and top officials since losing his job, contradicting official denials of continued contacts with an aide at the centre of a damaging political firestorm. Alexandre Benalla was fired in July after a video emerged of him beating a May Day protester but Macron was sharply criticised for failing to sack his former bodyguard immediately. The handling of the case triggered the first major political crisis for Macron, crystallising the public’s view of Macron as a remote figure who favoured his rich and powerful friends to the detriment of ordinary people. Benalla told the investigative journalism website Mediapart that he had been in touch with the president and other top officials via the messaging app Telegram since losing his job. “It will be hard for them to deny, since all these exchanges are on my mobile telephone,” Benalla said in an interview published on Monday. French officials have said there have been no contacts between Benalla and the presidency since the former bodyguard was sacked. A presidency official, who did not wish to be named, on Monday rejected Benalla’s version of events. The official dismissed Benalla’s comments as “a bundle of untruths and approximations”. Benalla’s lawyers did not return phone calls seeking comment. Separately, the French Foreign Ministry said Benalla had illegally kept and used diplomatic passports, despite being asked to return them at least twice. Paris prosecutors have opened a preliminary inquiry into the case. Benalla on Monday acknowledged using the passports while doing consultancy work in African countries. He said he had originally handed them in when he was fired but said they had been returned to him through the president’s staff in October. The Elysee official rejected Benalla’s account, adding the presidency did not know he had used the passports until media reports last week. Benalla’s interview comes at a sensitive time for Macron, who was due to give a nationwide New Year’s address later on Monday. Macron is struggling to end a wave of street protests which began as a response to fuel tax increases but which have since grown into a wider backlash against Macron’s reform policies.",0
" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Sunday to coordinate to prevent an authority vacuum from developing as the United States withdraws from Syria, the Turkish presidency said. In a phone call between the two leaders, Erdogan also expressed satisfaction with steps taken by Washington regarding combating terrorism in Syria and said Turkey was ready to provide any type of support, the presidency said.",0
" Paddy Ashdown, the face of centrist politics in Britain for more than a decade and a one-time marine commando who sought to secure peace in the former Yugoslavia, died on Saturday after being treated for cancer. He was 77. Ashdown led the Liberal Democrats for 11 years up to 1999, steering it to become a campaigning force in British politics against the Conservatives and the Labour Party. The party said Ashdown died on Saturday evening after a short illness. He had recently been hospitalised with bladder cancer. It said he would be remembered as someone who made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism. Tributes came in from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Theresa May said Ashdown served his country with distinction. “He dedicated his life to public service and he will be sorely missed,” she said in a statement. Calling Ashdown a “true patriot”, former Conservative Prime Minister John Major said: “In Government, Paddy Ashdown was my opponent. In Life, he was a much valued friend.” Jeremy John Ashdown was born in India on Feb. 27, 1941, the eldest son of an Indian army colonel. When he was five, his father became a pig-farmer in Northern Ireland. He was educated at an English private school where he earned the nickname Paddy because of his strong Irish accent. He spent years in the Royal Marines, and was on active service as a commando in the jungles of Borneo. He entered parliament in 1983 and was virtually unknown when he became leader of the pro-European party five years later. However his craggy good looks - he had short sandy hair - and an earnest expression swiftly helped him to become one of his country’s most popular leaders and for a time the “Mr Clean” of British politics. He also gained in stature during the 1991 Gulf War, which allowed him to display his military experience and diplomatic skills. Ashdown’s image as a family man above the sniping of mainstream politics took a hit in February 1992 when he was forced to admit to a brief extra-marital affair with his secretary. Having stood down in 1999, he went on to become the United Nations high representative and European Union special representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ashdown described himself as having few gifts other than strong willpower. “People said I couldn’t learn Chinese, they said I couldn’t run 30 miles in six hours. This sounds extraordinarily arrogant but I can’t remember a thing upon which I’ve set my mind that I didn’t succeed in doing,” he said in early 1992. He was replaced as head of the party by Charles Kennedy who enjoyed further electoral success when he opposed Blair’s decision to invade Iraq, and the party under Nick Clegg entered power in a coalition David Cameron’s Conservatives in 2010. It has since been decimated at the polls. Ashdown, the author of several books, had two children with his wife, Jane. He had in recent years campaigned alongside Cameron and other leaders for Britain to remain within the European Union. He warned that chaos could ensue if it voted to leave and described Brexit as “a sense of personal bereavement”.",0
" World stock markets continued a week-long sell-off on Friday as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and comments from a top White House trade adviser casting doubt that a breakthrough on trade tensions with China can be achieved compounded investor anxiety that global economic growth is slowing. MSCI’s index of global equities .MIWD00000PUS fell 1.5 percent, dragged down by broad declines in Europe and Asia. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks initially moved higher after Commerce Department data showed the U.S. economy is on pace to grow by 3 percent this year. But they pared their gains and then turned lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 414.23 points, or 1.81 percent, to 22,445.37, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 50.8 points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,416.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 195.41 points, or 2.99 percent, to 6,333.00. Stocks fell after Trump administration trade adviser Peter Navarro told Nikkei it would be “difficult” for the United States and China to reach a long-lasting trade agreement that would end the simmering trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from its recent highs, for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008. Broad stock markets in the United States and Europe are on pace for the worst quarter since 2008, while the Dow finished its worst week since late 2008. “China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He said speculation that the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. “Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.” U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless Congress authorizes money for a Mexico border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. Adding to the air of crisis was news that U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump announced a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was also planned. Oil prices, which slid just over 4 percent on Thursday, tumbled to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 1 percent to $45.41 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 fell 1.5 percent to $53.52. Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session. The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.783 percent, from 2.789 percent late on Thursday. As recently as October, yields had been at a seven-year high of 3.261 percent. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.76 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.74 percent to $1.1359.",0
" Malta’s armed forces saved 180 migrants in two rescue operations in the Mediterranean on Monday, less than 24 hours after picking up another group of 69. The army said a patrol boat picked up 28 migrants from a dinghy 71 miles (114 km) south-west of Malta and another 152 packed onboard a wooden vessel close by — the largest such rescue mission for many months. On Sunday, a Maltese patrol boat rescued 69 migrants from another wooden boat in distress south-west of the small Mediterranean island. However, a further 49 migrants remained blocked at sea days after they were picked up by two NGO rescue ships, with both Malta and Italy refusing to take them in as part of a concerted European effort to halt migration flows from Africa. The Sea-Watch 3 rescued 32 people on December 22 while the Sea-Eye’s Professor Albrecht Penck rescued 17 people on Saturday. Both boats are operated by German NGOs. Jan Ribbeck, head of mission on the Professor Albrecht Penck vessel, said maritime law stated that rescued people had to be moved to land as soon as possible. “It is utterly unscrupulous that no single European state is taking this responsibility,” he said in a statement, urging nearby Malta to take in the migrants for eventual redistribution among several EU countries, as has happened in the past. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) also called for the migrants to be allowed into a safe port before forecast bad weather arrived. “States need to implement a regional arrangement that provides shipmasters with clarity and predictability on where to disembark refugees and migrants rescued in the Mediterranean,” the U.N. refugee body said in a statement. Italy this year led the way into clamping down on migrants seeking to come to Europe in search of a better life. It has barred NGO rescue boats from docking in Italian ports and offered more help to Libya to prevent people from leaving. According to latest data provided by the Italian government on Dec. 28, some 12,977 migrants entered Italy this year via boats from Libya, down 87.9 percent on 2017 levels and 92.8 percent on 2016.",0
" Kuwait said on Monday it expected more Arab countries to reopen embassies in Damascus in “coming days” but added that the move would need a green light from the Arab League, which suspended Syria’s membership seven years ago. Arab states, including some that once backed rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, are seeking to reconcile with him after decisive gains by his forces in the war, aiming to expand their clout in Syria at the expense of non-Arab Turkey and Iran. The United Arab Emirates re-opened its embassy in Damascus last Thursday and Bahrain said the next day that its embassy there and the Syrian diplomatic mission in Manama had been operating “without interruption”. Kuwait’s Deputy foreign minister Khaled Al-Jarallah said the Gulf state remained committed to the Arab League’s decision and would reopen its embassy in Damascus once the organisation allowed it. Jarallah expected a “thaw in relations between Syria and Arab Gulf states in the coming days as more nations look to reopen their embassies in Damascus,” state news agency KUNA reported. Arab League’s permanent representatives are due to meet in Cairo on Jan. 6. U.S-allied Gulf Arab states were the main regional backers of armed groups opposed to Assad, providing finance or weapons or both, acting largely as part of a programme of support for the armed opposition coordinated by Washington. Unlike its other neighbours, Kuwait kept Syria’s embassy in Kuwait City open and opposed arming the rebels, although private donors in Kuwait sent funds to anti-Assad forces. Kuwait has led a humanitarian fundraising campaign for Syria through the United Nations. An Arab diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters last week he believed a majority of members wanted Syria to be readmitted. Syria’s membership of the Arab League was suspended in 2011 in response to the government’s violent crackdown on “Arab Spring” protests. For Syria to be reinstated, the Arab League must reach a consensus.",0
" Russian President Vladimir Putin told his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump in a New Year letter on Sunday that Moscow was ready for dialogue on a “wide-ranging agenda”, the Kremlin said following a series of failed attempts to hold a new summit. At the end of November, Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting with Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina, citing tensions about Russian forces opening fire on Ukrainian navy boats and then seizing them. Trump and Putin also failed to hold a full-fledged meeting in Paris on the sidelines of the centenary commemoration of the Armistice. The two leaders held their one and only summit in Helsinki in July. “Vladimir Putin stressed that the (Russia - United States) relations are the most important factor for providing strategic stability and international security,” a Kremlin statement said. “He confirmed that Russia is open for dialogue with the USA on the most wide-ranging agenda.” Moscow has said one of the key issues it wanted to discuss with the United States is Washington’s plans to withdraw from a Cold War era nuclear arms pact. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted as saying that now it was up to the United States whether to hold a new meeting in 2019. “The issue should be addressed to Washington. Both our president and his representatives have said that we are ready for the talks when Washington is ready for it,” TASS news agency quoted Lavrov as saying in televised remarks. In a separate letter to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Putin pledged continuation of aid to the Syrian government and people in the “fight against terrorism, in defence of state sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Putin also sent New Year greetings to other world leaders including prime ministers Theresa May of Britain and Shinzo Abe of Japan, as well as Chinese President Xi Jinping. Putin wished “well-being and prosperity to the British people”, the Kremlin said. Russia’s embassy in London said on Friday Moscow and London had agreed to return some staff to their respective embassies after they expelled dozens of diplomats early this year. Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats over accusations the Kremlin was behind a nerve toxin attack in March on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury. Russia, which denies any involvement in the poisoning, sent home the same number of British embassy workers in retaliation.",0
" The ruling 5-Star Movement expelled four parliamentarians from the party on Monday, including a former coast guard official who once famously ordered the captain of a sinking cruise liner to return to his doomed ship. The announcement underscored 5-Star’s determination to instil discipline in its ranks, even if it means weakening its fragile majority in the upper house Senate. The party said in a statement that senators Gregorio De Falco and Saverio De Bonis, along with European parliamentarians Giulia Moi and Marco Valli, had violated various internal 5-Star rules and had to leave the group immediately. “Everyone is important, nobody is indispensable,” 5-Star leader and Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Twitter. “Whoever does not support the government contract is out of the Movement. Respect for the electorate comes first.” The decision means the ruling coalition, made up of 5-Star and the League, has just 167 seats in the 320-seat Senate. De Falco signed up to the 5-Star cause earlier this year in what was seen as a major catch for the anti-establishment party, He subsequently won a Senate seat in a March national election. A former coast guard officer, De Falco was hailed as a hero in January 2012 when he confronted Francesco Schettino, who had sailed his cruise liner the Costa Concordia onto rocks off an Italian island and then abandoned the sinking ship. “Go back on board, damn it!” De Falco yelled at Schettino during a radio exchange that was made public. Schettino was subsequently sentenced to 16 years in jail for his role in the maritime disaster that killed 32 people. Since entering the Senate, De Falco has struggled to bow to party diktat. He voted against a bill promoted by 5-Star’s partner, the League, which clamped down on asylum rights. He voiced opposition to other government measures, and this week criticised the coalition for ramming its 2019 budget through parliament with only very limited debate. “I am very sorry and did not expect this,” De Falco said on Monday after hearing of his expulsion. Speaking to Reuters in November, De Falco dismissed suggestions he was too outspoken to remain within 5-Star. “This is a democracy. It would be unthinkable to remove someone simply for speaking their mind.” De Bonis was also opposed to the League’s security law and skipped the parliamentary vote. He additionally fell foul of the party leadership when it was revealed that a court had found him guilty of an administrative error in 2004 and ordered him to pay 2,775 euros ($3,170) in damages. Critics said the conviction should have prevented him from running for the party, which has sought to present a squeaky clean image to the electorate. De Bonis denied this, arguing it was not a criminal case and not a final verdict. ($1 = 0.8746 euros)",0

" Pollution levels spiked last week in New Delhi, India’s teeming capital of more than 20 million people, climbing to nearly 12 times the recommended level and exacerbating a public health crisis. Senior government officials said the main reasons for the surge in the amount of toxic smog trapped over New Delhi were unusually cold air, including fog, and slow wind speeds. Click here for an interactive Reuters graphic tmsnrt.rs/2GORiU9 on the link between Delhi's pollution and falling temperatures and wind speeds. The World Health Organization said this year India was home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities. New Delhi was ranked the sixth most polluted. In the city on Sunday, levels of PM 2.5, the amount of tiny particulate matter under 2.5 micrograms found in every cubic meter of air, were at 415, well above “hazardous” levels, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency says any level above 35 can be unhealthy. Pollution levels were exacerbated because of fumes from vehicles, pollutants from coal-fired power plants and industries, as well as smoke from fires being burned to keep people warm. In October and November, crop residue burning in the neighboring states of Haryana and Punjab also contributed to air pollution. In India, air pollution claimed 1.24 million lives in 2017, or 12.5 percent of total deaths, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health this month.",0
" The pace of reform in China will not stagnate and it will open its door wider still to the outside world, President Xi Jinping said on Monday in his New Year message, as he also warned of challenges ahead. Xi has repeatedly pledged his support for reform this year, as China marks 40 years since landmark changes to its economic model, amid mounting pressure to improve market access for foreign companies as a trade war with the United States weighs. In a speech carried by all major state media, Xi said that in 2018 China had pushed more than 100 important reform measures. “The world has seen a China whose reforms and opening up have gathered speed...,” Xi said. “Our pace of reforms will not stagnate, and the door to opening up will widen further.” Xi made no specific mention of the trade war with the United States, noting that 2019 would bring “opportunities and challenges”. “As we open our eyes to look at the world, we are faced with huge changes, changes not seen in 100 years,” he added, without elaborating. “No matter how the international situation changes, China’s confidence and determination to safeguard national sovereignty and security will not change. China’s sincerity and goodwill for maintaining world peace and promoting common development will not change.” Looking back at 2018, Xi said that China’s economy stayed within a “reasonable range”, as despite various risks and challenges, it sped up the fostering of new growth drivers to replace old ones. China’s factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years in December, as it seeks to end its bruising trade war with Washington and reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown in 2019. China says it is still on track to hit its growth target of around 6.5 percent in 2018, down from 6.9 percent in 2017, but the economy is expected to lose further momentum in 2019. The World Bank predicts growth will slow to 6.2 percent in 2019, still robust by global standards but what would be the weakest expansion in nearly 30 years.",0
" Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Monday he “did not see any danger” to the government in the coming months as it turns its attention to new reforms after finally pushing its 2019 budget into law. Parliament approved the much-contested budget on Saturday, just ahead of a year-end deadline, following a deal with the European Commission which calmed financial markets and averted a risk of financial fines against Rome. “I hope this will be the last budget to be approved via long and complicated negotiations with Brussels,” Salvini said in an interview with newspaper Il Corriere della Sera, adding that he hoped EU veto power on state finances would soon be shelved. Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister and ex-leader of the centre-left opposition Democratic Party, predicted on Monday that the coalition could break up before European parliamentary elections scheduled for May 26. Renzi told La Stampa daily that the ruling parties — the League and 5-Star Movement — were deeply divided over an array of issues and said the government would surely split apart. “But we won’t head to early elections,” he said, predicting instead either a major coalition reshuffle or the creation of a new ruling alliance from the various parliamentary strands. Salvini, who heads the League, dismissed the idea. “You do not change a winning team,” Salvini said in comments released on his Facebook page. Salvini said among the first measures the government would tackle in the New Year were a bill to strengthen “legitimate defence” rights for ordinary people and also a push for greater autonomy for the northern regions of Veneto and Lombardy. Prominent League leaders have warned that the 7-month-old coalition will fall if its devolution plan is blocked by a clearly reticent 5-Star. While the League strongholds are in the rich northern regions of Italy, 5-Star votes are concentrated in the country’s poorer south. The southern regions are worried that they will receive less funding in future if Lombardy and Veneto get to keep more of their own tax take. “Handing over more power to regional governors and city mayors will benefit both north and south. Spending decisions taken by local administrations avoid waste and robbery,” Salvini said on Facebook. Lombardy and Veneto together account for around a third of Italy’s economic output. They signed a preliminary deal with the former centre-left government to gain greater oversight in 23 policy areas, including the environment, infrastructure, health and education, but the accord was not enacted before national elections in March redrew the political map in Italy. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he will present his proposals to the regions by Feb. 15.",0
" U.S. President Donald Trump will remain in Washington through Christmas “due to the shutdown,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Saturday. Trump had been scheduled to travel to his Florida resort with his family for the end of year holidays, but said on Friday he would stay in Washington if he and lawmakers failed to strike a budget deal to avert a partial government shutdown. He left it unclear at the time, however, how long he might remain in the capital.",0
" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that President Donald Trump told him he had “never suggested firing” the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Mnuchin said in a tweet that Trump had told him that he “never suggested firing” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump also told Mnuchin he did not believe he had the right to fire Powell. Sources had told Reuters on Saturday that Trump had privately discussed the possibility of firing Powell, a move that could roil already volatile financial markets.",0
" Following weeks of talks between President Donald Trump and congressional leaders, parts of the U.S. government shut down on Saturday after negotiators reached an impasse over a deal to keep the government fully funded. At issue was funding for a wall along the country’s southern border with Mexico. The House of Representatives passed a bill that included $5 billion Trump had demanded for a wall, but the Senate included considerably less money for border security. The partial shutdown will affect about 15 percent of the federal workforce, a senior administration official said on Saturday, as a majority of agencies and departments, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, already have secured funding. Still, some 800,000 employees from the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation and others will be affected. According to the American Federation of Government Employees, 420,000 people who have been deemed “essential” must work without pay, while 380,000 others will not be able to report for work at all. Trump administration officials say anyone working without pay will receive back pay once a deal is reached. Below is what will happen at some of the agencies and departments affected by the shutdown. The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected by the shutdown. But most of those agencies’ employees are considered essential, so they will need to work without pay until a government funding bill is passed. Of the 245,000 people who work under the department’s umbrella, nearly 213,000 have been deemed essential, according to the department’s contingency plan. Of the department’s 7,500 employees, only 343 are expected to work. Nearly 1,000 other people may be called in to work on specific tasks, for which they will not be paid until a funding bill is passed. Though public housing authorities and tribally designated housing entities are not part of the federal government and are not required to shut down, some of their funding is provided by the federal government, so they may need to reduce or change normal operating hours. The department, which is also responsible for some housing loans and low-income housing payments, said in its contingency plan a shutdown would likely not significantly affect the housing market. But, it added, “a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market that we’ve been experiencing.” The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, will have a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, no national parks will be open and no visitor services - including restrooms, facility maintenance and trash collection - will be provided. But some governors have pledged to step in, including in Arizona, the site of the Grand Canyon, and New York, where the state has provided funding for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to stay open. Of the department’s 55,000 employees, 20,400 will be put on leave. Those employees do not include most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 will be working, or the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources. Air traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations will continue, but some rulemaking, inspections and audits will be paused. An estimated 1,100 of the office’s 1,800 employees would be placed on leave. This will include most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps the president implement his budget and policy goals.",0
" Acknowledging that her government disappointed many Germans in 2018, Chancellor Angela Merkel sought to pull the country together for 2019 with a call for solidarity and cooperation to overcome deep political divisions. In her New Year speech, Merkel said she recognised that many Germans “bemoaned” the ruling coalition that took office in March, an alliance of her conservative bloc and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), which has been blighted by infighting. But she added: “We will only master the challenges of our times if we stick together and collaborate with others across borders.” Germany is still feeling the impact of Merkel’s 2015 decision to leave open the country’s borders to more than 1 million refugees, mainly fleeing war in the Middle East. Resentment at that decision helped feed the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), which surged into the Bundestag for the first time at last year’s federal election, fracturing the country’s political landscape. Merkel has given up the leadership of her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), but wants to remain chancellor for the remainder of the current legislative period through to 2021 - a goal she referenced again in her New Year’s speech. A poll on Sunday showed a majority of those surveyed Germans who expressed an opinion supported her staying on as chancellor for the full term. Merkel stressed what she called Germany’s values of “openness, tolerance, respect” and said the country would work towards “global solutions” when it starts a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council from Jan. 1. Merkel has sought to defend the Western order on which Germany depends and which U.S. President Donald Trump has destabilised by pulling out of international agreements on climate change and Iran’s nuclear programme, and with tariffs. She said she was committed to making the European Union more robust and capable of taking decisions. “And with Britain, we want to maintain a close partnership despite the withdrawal from the European Union,” she added.

" A court in the United Arab Emirates upheld on Monday a 10-year jail sentence against pro-democracy campaigner Ahmed Mansoor for criticising the government on social media, two sources said on Monday. The state security court’s ruling against Mansoor, who prior to his imprisonment had been one of a tiny number of publicly active rights campaigners in the UAE, was later reported by the Abu Dhabi-government owned National newspaper. A trade and tourism hub, the UAE is an absolute monarchy which tolerates little public criticism. Mansoor, a 49-year-old electrical engineer and poet, was among five activists convicted of insulting the UAE’s rulers in 2011. They were pardoned the same year. He was arrested again in March 2017 at his home in Ajman, on charges of publishing false information and rumours, promoting a sectarian and hate-incited agenda, and using social media to “harm national unity and social harmony and damage the country’s reputation”. In May 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and handed a fine of 1 million dirhams ($270,000). The court upheld both the jail sentence and fine on Monday, the two sources said on condition of anonymity. The National also said that Mansoor would remain under surveillance for three years upon his release and that Monday’s ruling was not subject to further appeal. United Nations human rights experts, the European Parliament and rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW), are among those to have urged the UAE to release Mansoor and condemned his detention as a violation of freedom of expression and opinion. In 2015 Mansoor received the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, an annual prize awarded by a panel of international human rights NGOs, for his work documenting the human rights situation in the UAE. Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director, Lynn Maalouf said: “Instead of punishing Ahmed Mansoor for daring to express his opinions, the authorities must ensure his conviction and sentence are quashed and release him immediately and unconditionally.” Human Rights Watch said in March 2018 it believed Mansoor was being held in solitary confinement, a concern echoed in a resolution by the European Parliament on the case. “The UAE’s railroading of prominent human rights advocate Ahmed Mansoor is yet another stain on the country’s reputation,” Adam Coogle, Middle East researcher at HRW, said. “So long as Mansoor remains in prison, no amount of money nor army of public relations firms will be able to wash away this stain.” Reporting By Aziz El Yaakoubi, additional reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" A French court has authorised Central Africa Republic soccer executive and alleged militia leader Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona to be handed over to the Hague war crimes tribunal, a judicial source said on Monday. Ngaissona, who has been described by prosecutors as the “senior leader” of the anti-balaka militia that carried out systematic attacks on the Muslim population in 2013-2014, was arrested in France on Dec. 12. The International Criminal Court (ICC) says Ngaissona is suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, extermination, deportation, persecution, torture, attacking civilians, and recruiting child soldiers. Ngaissona, who was elected as a top executive of Africa’s football governing body CAF, has denied the charges. A search was carried out at his French home after he was detained at Charles de Gaulle airport and the investigating chamber of the Paris appeal court has now ordered him to be handed over to the war crimes tribunal, the source said. The decision is subject to appeal, the source added. The ICC said on Dec. 12 it had made a request to French authorities for Ngaïssona to be handed over to the court once national procedure had been completed. Central African Republic has been mired by inter-communal violence since 2013 after a coalition of mostly northern rebels known as Seleka, seized power in March 2013. Their brutal rule gave rise to the mostly Christian anti-balaka militia. Despite the presence of thousands United Nations peacekeepers and a presidential election, tit-for-tat violence has continued and thousands have died due to the conflict. The ICC has said it is investigating crimes committed by all parties in the conflict including the Seleka rebels. In November, another leader of the anti-balaka militia Alfred Yekatom, a sitting member of the country’s parliament once nicknamed “Rambo”, was arrested and handed to The Hague court.",0
" Iraqi warplanes hit a meeting of Islamic State leaders near Deir al-Zor in Syria on Monday, destroying the building they were gathered in, the military said in a statement, without giving further details about the militants targeted. The statement said F-16 fighter jets carried out the raid around al-Sousa village in eastern Syria, as “30 leaders from Daesh (Islamic State) gangs” met in the building. The strike came a day after Iraq’s government hinted at greater involvement for its armed forces in Syria as the U.S. begins withdrawing troops from the country. Iraq fears that Islamic State militants in Syria will try to cross the border, and analysts warn of increasing insurgent-style attacks in both countries. Baghdad has carried out several air raids in Syrian territory with the agreement of President Bashar al-Assad. Its army and Shi’ite paramilitaries have reinforced at the border in recent months.",0
" The mayor of the northwestern Bosnian town of Banja Luka has cancelled Monday’s New Year celebrations for security reasons after protesters demanding the truth about a student’s death prevented a public concert taking place the previous evening. The group “Justice for David” protested on Sunday for the 280th day in a row, demanding the resignations of the Bosnian Serb interior minister and other police officials who they believe covered up the alleged murder of David Dragicevic in March. During Sunday’s march, which lasted several hours, demonstrators prevented a regional folk star from performing. Special police dispersed the crowd, detaining several people. “There will be no concerts,” Mayor Igor Radojicic told a news conference. “Banja Luka will be mute at midnight for the first time since the war,” he said, referring to 1992-1995 Bosnian war. “Those who need to resolve Dragicevic’s case should understand this silence,” Radojicic added, calling on the police and judicial authorities to solve the case and allow life in the town to return to normal. Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who is the chairman of Bosnia’s three-man inter-ethnic presidency said the protesters had “crossed all lines”, adding that he supported a police ban on unapproved protests. Residents of Banja Luka were expected to gather in the central square later on Monday for concerts by regional pop stars and a fireworks display, as well as events for children. Dragicevic’s father Davor has led a daily protest since his son’s body was found in a creek in the town after he was missing for six days. He believes David was murdered and that the police were involved in covering up the killing. His quest has grown into a larger movement of citizens fed up with corruption and what they say is Bosnia’s poor rule of law. Smaller-scale protests in solidarity with the grieving father have taken place across ethnically divided Bosnia but also in neighbouring Croatia and Serbia. Police initially said David Dragicevic had committed suicide but later said there was a possibility he had been killed. The prosecution team handling the case have not presented any evidence of murder. Bosnian Serb interior minister Dragan Lukac has previously said that the police carried out their investigation professionally. The police detained Davor Dragicevic last week over alleged threats to Lukac, later releasing him. On Monday, police issued a warrant for his arrest, along with several other protesters who they said caused incidents on Sunday.",0
" Ana Luz, sister-in-law of Ronald Blanco, looked on grimly as neighbours of the murdered Honduran man washed away the rills of blood left where his bullet-ridden body had lain outside his house in a troubled barrio on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa. It was just one of many scenes I witnessed this year while on assignment in Honduras, where thousands of people sought to escape violence and poverty by joining a migrant caravan in hope of making it to safety across the Mexico-U.S. border. The problems in this small Central American country grabbed international attention as U.S. President Donald Trump cracked down on illegal immigration. Honduras has for years been one of the world’s most murderous countries. Though official data show the homicide rate has fallen sharply, it continues to be a highly challenging environment in which to work. According to Honduran government figures, the homicide rate reached 86 per 100,000 people in 2011-2012. This year, the rate should end below 40 per 100,000, the security ministry says. This compares to the latest statistics in the United States, where there were 5.3 murders per 100,000 in 2017, according to the FBI’s most recent report on its website. Danger in Honduras is never far away. During my roughly three months spent in Honduras in 2018, I photographed mothers waiting at the morgue for the bodies of murdered sons and daughters, police keeping watch over corpses left lying on streets after shootouts and families wailing over the coffins of loved ones. Blanco, 37, lived in the Japon neighbourhood, a breeding ground for gang violence, according to local authorities. It was here that I experienced the most tense moment of my time in Honduras, as I moved between police, soldiers, gang members, forensic experts, hearse drivers and pastors. At Blanco’s funeral, I was stopped by a young man with piercing eyes, one green and one blue. He demanded to know why I was there. I explained that I was a journalist taking photographs of the event. But the youth kept pressing me with questions about what had brought me to Blanco’s funeral. As I continued taking the photos, I felt increasingly uncomfortable. Finally, the tension eased when one of Blanco’s friends intervened, saying that the grieving family had authorized my presence. For photo essay, please click on: reut.rs/2EVrBhU",0
" Relatives of at least 15 Indian miners trapped in a “rat-hole” mine for 18 days said on Monday they have given up hope that any of them would be found alive, even as rescue operations were stepped up. “We want his body back so that we can give him a decent burial,” said the uncle of 26-year old Omar Ali, who is among those trapped in the mine. The miners were trapped on Dec. 13, when an illegal mine in India’s northeastern Meghalaya state, was flooded. Thousands of workers, including children, have been killed in so-called rat-hole mining, which involves miners crawling into narrow shafts on bamboo ladders to mine for low-quality coal, in Meghalaya. The state banned such unregulated mining in 2014 but it still goes on in some places. A survivor of the disaster, Sayeb Ali, 24, said he too thought there was little chance of anyone coming out alive. He said 17 miners were trapped in the accident. It was not clear why his figure differed from the government account of 15 miners. Sayeb Ali said he has survived as he was not deep inside the very narrow mine shaft when disaster struck. “The people who were digging coal went deep inside and cart-pullers like me and the other four who survived were about eight to 10 feet inside,” Sayeb Ali, who is not related to Omar Ali, told Reuters by telephone. India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries to be a coal miner, with one miner dying every six days on average in 2017, according to government data. Government officials said on Monday rescuers have only been able to find three helmets and two axes underground. Officials said the navy on Sunday sent 15 divers with cameras and specialist equipment into the mine in an attempt to reach the bottom of the pit, but they had found nothing. “The problem is there is murky water that entered the rat-hole pit from a nearby river,” Santosh Kumar Singh, an official with the National Disaster Response Force, told Reuters.",0
" A crude bomb, blamed by security forces on a small pro-Islamic State militant group, killed two people and wounded dozens on Monday in the southern Philippines, an army commander said. Islamist militants operate in the south of the largely Christian Asian country and some are known to have links with groups abroad, including al Qaeda and Islamic State. Major General Cirilito Sobejana, an army division commander, told Reuters the bomb bore a “Daesh-inspired signature”, referring to Islamic State by another name. The bomb went off at the entrance to a shopping mall in the city of Cotabato in the early afternoon. As well as the two people killed, 28 were wounded, he said. A second bomb was recovered in the same area, he said. Sobejana said he suspected the blast was retaliation for the killing by government troops of seven members of a small militant group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.",0
" Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Monday her government tried to ensure a free and general election and the opposition lost because it lacked leadership.

" Britain’s opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn would push ahead with Brexit and seek to renegotiate the terms if he won a snap election next year, he said on Saturday, in a blow to party supporters who want a second referendum. Like much of Britain, Corbyn’s Labour party is deeply divided over Brexit, with some senior lawmakers leading calls for a fresh vote and others representing areas that recorded the highest support for leaving the European Union in the 2016 plebiscite. Corbyn, a Socialist with little passion for the EU, has been reluctant to support a second referendum, or People’s Vote, but with less than 100 days to go until Brexit the clamour is growing for either a delay or a second vote to prevent Britain leaving without a deal. “You’d have to go back and negotiate, and see what the timetable would be,” the 69-year-old told the Guardian newspaper, when asked what he would do if he won an early election designed to break the deadlock in parliament. Asked what stance Labour would take if a referendum were held, Corbyn said: “it would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be; but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.” Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. Prime Minister Theresa May has struck a withdrawal agreement with Brussels but was forced to pull a parliamentary vote on it last week after admitting she would lose by a large margin. A new election is not due until 2022 but one could be called if May fails to get her primary policy through parliament. Labour wants a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its lucrative single market. The policy has been dubbed “constructive ambiguity” by some, who question whether Labour could negotiate a better deal. Critics argue that Corbyn has been happy to go along with the policy as long as the vote to leave the bloc is respected. He told the Guardian he still had concerns about EU rules on state aid, and that he had to balance the views of all those in the party and understand why so many voted to leave the world’s biggest trading bloc. He said his plan for a customs union with the EU, to protect trade and access to the market, was designed to do just that.",0
" Turkey will take over the fight against Islamic State militants in Syria as the United States withdraws its troops, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, in the latest upheaval wrought by Washington’s abrupt policy shift. The surprise announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump this week that he would withdraw roughly 2,000 troops has felled a pillar of American policy in the Middle East. Critics say Trump’s decision will make it harder to find a diplomatic solution to Syria’s seven-year-old conflict. For Turkey, the step removes a source of friction with the United States. Erdogan has long castigated his NATO ally over its support for Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters against Islamic State. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group and an offshoot of the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), fighting for Kurdish autonomy across the border on Turkish soil. In a speech in Istanbul, Erdogan said Turkey would mobilise to fight remaining Islamic State forces in Syria and temporarily delay plans to attack Kurdish fighters in the northeast of Syria - shifts both precipitated by the American decision to withdraw. The news was less welcome for other U.S. allies. Both France and Germany warned that the U.S. change of course risked damaging the campaign against Islamic State, the jihadists who seized big swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014-15 but have now been beaten back to a sliver of Syrian territory. Likewise, the U.S.-backed militia spearheaded by the YPG said a Turkish attack would force it to divert fighters from the battle against Islamic State to protect its territory. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said American troops may continue to operate against Islamic State in Syria. The Pentagon is considering using Special Operation teams based in Iraq to target militants in Syria, the official said. The official emphasized that using special operators on the ground was one of many options being considered, was still in the planning stages and that no final decision had been made. Islamic State launched an attack on Friday in Syria’s southeast against the U.S.-backed SDF militia, employing car bombs and dozens of militants. “We will be working on our operational plans to eliminate ISIS (Islamic State) elements, which are said to remain intact in Syria, in line with our conversation with President Trump,” Erdogan said. The Turkish president had announced plans last week to start an operation east of the Euphrates River in northern Syria to oust the YPG from the area that it largely controls. This week, he said the campaign could come at any moment. But on Friday, he cited the talk with Trump as a reason to wait. “Our phone call with President Trump, along with contacts between our diplomats and security officials and statements by the United States, have led us to wait a little longer,” he said. “We have postponed our military operation against the east of the Euphrates river until we see on the ground the result of America’s decision to withdraw from Syria.” Erdogan said, however, that this was not an “open-ended waiting period” and that, due to past “negative experiences”, Ankara welcomed the United States’ statements with an equal amount of pleasure and caution. Turkey has repeatedly voiced frustration over what it says is the slow implementation of a deal with Washington to pull YPG fighters out of Manbij, a town in mainly Arab territory west of the Euphrates in northern Syria. The United States will probably end its air campaign against IS in Syria when it pulls out troops, U.S. officials have said. Erdogan’s foreign minister said the withdrawal plan would be discussed by the two countries in Washington in January. Trump maintained that IS had been wiped out, a view not shared by key allies, that Washington had been doing the work of other countries and it was “time for others to finally fight”. His defence secretary, Jim Mattis, opposed the decision and abruptly announced on Thursday he was resigning after meeting with the president. In a candid letter to Trump, the retired Marine general emphasised the importance of “showing respect” to allies that have voiced surprise and concern about the president’s decision. Russia said on Friday it did not understand what the United States’ next steps in Syria would be, adding that chaotic and unpredictable decision-making in Washington was creating discomfort in international affairs. Several of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress, joined by opposition Democrats, urged the president to reverse course, saying the withdrawal would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in Syria and enable a resurgence of Islamic State. Trump has given no sign of changing his mind. He promised to remove forces from Syria during his 2016 election campaign. The roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, many of them special forces, were ostensibly helping to combat Islamic State but were also seen as a possible bulwark against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken much of the country from his foes in the multi-sided civil war, with military help from Iran and Russia. IS declared a caliphate in 2014 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq. The ultra-hardline Sunni militants established their de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe. A senior U.S. official last week said Islamic State was down to the last 1 percent of the territory it once held. The group has no remaining territory in Iraq, though militants have resumed attacks since their defeat there last year. Islamic State launched an attack on Friday on positions held by the SDF in Syria’s southeast and the U.S.-led coalition mounted air strikes in the area, an SDF official said. Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria may not be able to continue to hold Islamic State prisoners if the situation in the region gets out of control after a U.S. pullout, top Syrian Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said on Friday.

" Malaysia is seeking $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) over its dealings with scandal-linked state fund 1MDB, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Friday, citing the finance minister. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Singapore had expanded its criminal investigation of 1MDB to include Goldman Sachs, in a sign of increasing scrutiny of the bank’s role in the suspected multi-billion-dollar money laundering scheme. Malaysian prosecutors this week filed charges against Goldman Sachs in connection with its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the first criminal action against the U.S. bank over the scandal. Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of the bond sales. In addition to the bonds’ total value, Goldman Sachs should also return $1 billion to cover $600 million in fees paid to the bank and bond coupons that were “higher than the market rate”, the FT quoted Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng as saying. Lim also told the FT that reparations should at least be more than $1.8 billion, the sum Goldman Sachs has told investors it had set aside to cover potential losses related to 1MDB legal proceedings. “Their figure is $1.8 billion. Ours is $7.5 billion,” Lim said. Malaysia is not currently negotiating with Goldman, but charges filed on Monday could bring the bank to the table, Lim said. In an emailed response to Reuters, a Goldman Sachs spokesman said the bank intended to “vigorously contest these charges”. “The 1MDB bond offerings were meant to raise money to benefit Malaysia; instead, a huge portion of those funds were stolen for the benefit of members of the Malaysian government and their associates,” the spokesman said. “Certain members of that government and 1MDB lied to Goldman about the use of proceeds from these transactions.” Critics have said the fees earned by Goldman Sachs were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent a bank could expect for helping sell bonds. Goldman has said the outsized fees related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds quickly. Malaysia has sought jail terms and billions in fines from Goldman Sachs and four individuals who allegedly misappropriated about $2.7 billion from the 1MDB bond proceeds. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that a total of about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and used to buy, among others, real estate in London and New York, expensive jewellery and artwork, and a private jet. Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources, reported that Singapore has expanded a criminal investigation into fund flows linked to 1MDB to include Goldman Sachs. Authorities in Singapore were trying to determine whether some of the $600 million in fees that Goldman earned from the three bond deals flowed to the Singapore subsidiary, the news agency said. In response to the report, the Singapore police said their criminal investigation into entities involved in 1MDB-related offence in Singapore had been going on since 2015. They did not comment further. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said in a statement: “The firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter.” Goldman Sachs (Singapore) PTE was one of the three units charged by Malaysia this week. Shares of the U.S. investment bank fell to a two-year low this week after Malaysia filed the charges. Two former Goldman Sachs bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, have been charged by Malaysia and the U.S. Department of Justice. Singapore has banned Leissner, the bank’s former Southeast Asia chairman, from its securities industry for life after he pleaded guilty in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The United States is also seeking extradition of Ng, who has been detained in Malaysia.",0
" An Israeli court sentenced a Palestinian to 18 years imprisonment on Monday for stabbing to death a British woman in Jerusalem last year, under a plea bargain acknowledging he is mentally ill. Jamil Tamimi, 59, killed 21-year-old exchange student Hannah Bladon on a tram as she was going to the church where she volunteered, the court heard. He targeted her at random when she came within his reach after offering her seat to an older woman, stabbing her at least seven times. “This was not a terrorist incident ... This was a terrible murder carried out by a mentally ill person,” the prosecutor said, explaining why a life prison sentence had not been sought, according to a court transcript. Tamimi’s lawyer said the defendant attacked Bladon in a rage at his sons insisting that he stay in a mental institution rather than with them. “This drove him to stab a person to death so that he would be shot dead,” the lawyer said. In the April 14, 2017 incident, Tamimi was overpowered and arrested. Dozens of Palestinians who carried out similar attacks, many of them as a political act against Israel, have been shot by security forces or armed civilians. Bladon’s relatives said the sentence was too lenient. “For the family, it makes no difference whether this was a terror attack or just another crazed murderer,” the family’s representative, Israeli lawyer Maurice Hirsch, told Reuters. “They are outraged by the leniency of the sentence. They expected that Hannah’s murderer would spent the rest of his life behind bars.” The court transcript quoted Tamimi as saying after sentencing: “I’m sorry. I wish I could take her (Bladon’s) place. I did not mean to murder her. I don’t know how it happened.” Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Robin Pomeroy All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

" At least 22 people have died due to landslides and flooding triggered by a tropical cyclone that brought heavy rains to central Philippines, a disaster agency official said on Sunday. The people, including a three-year-old boy, were reported dead as of Sunday morning, said disaster agency spokesman Edgar Posadas, after a tropical cyclone barrelled through the eastern Visayas and Bicol regions on Saturday. “The wind was not strong but it caused flooding and landslides,” Posadas said. The number of casualties could rise as rescue and retrieval operations continue. Local media have reported dozens missing or trapped by the landslides. A regional office of the disaster agency said it was working to confirm the deaths of 38 people in the Bicol region, located south of the main island of Luzon. Thousands of passengers were stranded at seaports, airports and bus terminals as dozens of inter-island trips were cancelled. The tropical depression, which has since been downgraded to a low pressure area, left the Philippines on Sunday afternoon. About 20 tropical cyclones hit the Philippines every year.",0
